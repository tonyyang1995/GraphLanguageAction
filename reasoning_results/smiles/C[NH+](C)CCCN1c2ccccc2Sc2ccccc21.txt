Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+](C)CCCN1c2ccccc2Sc2ccccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (N+), which suggests it may interact with negatively charged sites on proteins, potentially affecting ion channels or receptors.
Step 2: The presence of multiple aromatic rings, particularly the benzene ring and cyclohexane ring, indicates the molecule could act as an agonist or antagonist for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The cyclic structure with sulfur atoms (S) might indicate a potential interaction with cysteine residues in proteins, which are common in many receptor families.
Step 4: Given the pattern of the molecule, it is likely to interact with GPCRs such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which have characteristic aromatic and sulfur-containing regions.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule's structure could influence enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 due to its hydrophobic and aromatic nature, which are involved in drug metabolism.
