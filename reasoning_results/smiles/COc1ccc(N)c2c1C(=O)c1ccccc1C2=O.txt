Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(N)c2c1C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple rings, including a benzene ring and a pyrrole ring, with a nitrogen atom in the pyrrole ring. It also has a carboxylic acid group and an amide group.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylic acid and amide groups suggests the molecule could act as a ligand or inhibitor for enzymes or receptors that bind to these functional groups.
Step 3: Considering the structure, the molecule might interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to its potential to fit into the receptor's binding pocket, given the size and shape of the molecule.
Step 4: Several genes listed are involved in GPCR function, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, and DRD2, DRD3, DRD4. These genes encode receptors that could potentially interact with the described molecule.
Step 5: The molecule's structure and functional groups suggest it could be a ligand for these receptors, potentially modulating their activity.
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
