Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)(C)c1cnc(CSc2c[n-]c(=NC(=O)C3CC[NH2+]CC3)s2)o1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule, which appears to be a benzodiazepine derivative. This class of compounds typically interacts with GABA-A receptors, which are encoded by several genes including GABRA1, GABRB1, GABRC, and GABRD. However, none of these genes are listed in the provided gene list.
Step 2: The molecule also contains a pyrrole ring, which is often found in molecules that interact with the serotonin system. Serotonin receptors are encoded by genes such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C. Among the provided genes, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4 encode dopamine receptors, which are not directly involved in serotonin signaling.
Step 3: The presence of a naphthylamine moiety suggests potential interaction with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C19 and CYP2D6. These genes are listed in the provided gene list.
Step 4: The molecule also has a quinoline-like structure, which might indicate interactions with ion channels or transporters. SLC6A2 and SLC6A4 are neurotransmitter transporter genes, and CNR1 encodes the cannabinoid receptor, which could be relevant if the molecule has cannabinoid-like activity.
Step 5: Given the structure, the most likely related genes from the provided list are CYP2C19, CYP2D6, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2C19, CYP2D6, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
