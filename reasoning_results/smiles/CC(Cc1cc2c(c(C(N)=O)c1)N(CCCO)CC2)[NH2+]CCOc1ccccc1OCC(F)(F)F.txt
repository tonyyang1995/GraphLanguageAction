Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(Cc1cc2c(c(C(N)=O)c1)N(CCCO)CC2)[NH2+]CCOc1ccccc1OCC(F)(F)F, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with multiple substituents, including a cyano group (-CN), a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and amide and ester functionalities. This complex structure suggests it may interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism and signaling pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group and carboxylic acid suggests the molecule could be an inhibitor or substrate for enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize drugs containing similar functional groups.
Step 3: The amide functionality in the molecule indicates potential interactions with receptors that have amine binding sites, such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 4: Given the presence of a carboxylic acid and ester groups, this molecule might also influence G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which often bind to ligands with hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions.
Step 5: The overall structure and functional groups suggest this molecule could interact with various enzymes and receptors involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction, such as DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, PTGS1, and SIGMAR1.
