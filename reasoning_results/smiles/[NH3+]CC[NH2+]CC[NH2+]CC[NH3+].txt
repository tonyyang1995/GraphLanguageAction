Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a cyclic amine compound with multiple positively charged nitrogen atoms. This indicates it has potential to interact with ion channels and receptors that have binding sites for amine compounds.
Step 2: The cyclic structure and positive charges suggest the molecule could potentially bind to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) like adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4). These receptors are known to have binding sites for amine-based ligands.
Step 3: Additionally, the cyclic amine structure may also be recognized by other receptors like dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), which are involved in neurotransmission and have binding sites for various small molecules including amines.
Step 4: The presence of multiple positively charged centers might allow the molecule to interact with ion channels such as KCNH2, which is a potassium channel subunit.
Step 5: Given the pattern of multiple positively charged amines and cyclic structures, this molecule could be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, KCNH2. 
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, KCNH2. Step 1: The molecule is a cyclic amine compound with multiple positively charged nitrogen atoms.
