Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)(c1ccc([O-])cc1)c1ccc([O-])cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure containing a benzene ring with alkyl substituents and an oxygen-containing heterocyclic group. The presence of an oxygen atom in the heterocyclic group suggests that the molecule might have some pharmacological activity, possibly as an agonist or antagonist for receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: Analyzing the pattern of the molecule, it contains a benzene ring with alkyl substituents and an oxygen-containing heterocyclic group. This structure could potentially interact with receptors such as adrenergic (adrenoceptor) and cholinergic receptors, which are encoded by several genes listed. For instance, the presence of a benzene ring and alkyl groups could be similar to ligands that bind to these receptors.
Step 3: The oxygen-containing heterocyclic group could suggest interaction with enzymes involved in metabolism or signaling pathways. Genes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which encode cytochrome P450 enzymes, are involved in drug metabolism and could be influenced by the molecule's structure. Additionally, genes encoding receptors that interact with G-proteins, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, and HTR2C, could also be relevant due to their involvement in signal transduction pathways.
Step 4: The molecule's structure also hints at potential interactions with ion channels, such as those encoded by KCNH2, which is involved in cardiac repolarization and could be modulated by the molecule's alkyl substituents. Furthermore, the oxygen-containing heterocyclic group might influence the binding affinity of the molecule to other ion channels or transporters.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis and the potential interactions with various receptors, enzymes, and ion channels, the molecule could be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, and OPRK1.
