Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COC(=O)N=c1[n-]c2ccc([S+](O)c3ccccc3)cc2[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound with a central carbon atom (C) that is double-bonded to an oxygen atom (O), forming a carbonyl group (C=O). This structure suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid or amide functional group, which could be relevant to enzymes involved in metabolism or drug transport.
Step 2: The molecule also contains a nitrogen atom (N) that is negatively charged (-), likely part of a heterocyclic ring system (c1[n-]c2ccc([S+](O)c3ccccc3)cc2[n-]1). This indicates the presence of a sulfonamide group attached to a substituted aromatic ring, which is characteristic of certain drug molecules.
Step 3: The aromatic ring system (c3ccccc3) and the positively charged sulfur atom ([S+](O)) suggest the molecule has potential for interacting with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways or receptors, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 4: Given the pattern of the molecule, it may interact with genes encoding proteins involved in neurotransmitter signaling, including HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are all related to serotonin and dopamine receptors.
Step 5: The molecule might also interact with genes like CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which encode cytochrome P450 enzymes responsible for metabolizing many drugs, given its complex structure and potential for metabolic interactions.
