Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCc1c(C(=O)NCCc2ccc(N3CCCCC3)cc2)[nH]c2ccc(Cl)cc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with an amide group (C(=O)N) attached, which suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the amide group and the overall aromatic structure indicate possible binding to receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B) and dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4).
Step 3: The molecule also has a quinoline-like structure, which may interact with CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), known for their role in metabolizing various drugs.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule’s ability to form hydrogen bonds due to its amide and hydroxyl groups could potentially bind to ion channels like KCNH2 and ligand-gated ion channels such as HRH1.
Step 5: Given these structural features, the molecule is likely to be related to genes encoding adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B), dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), and ion channels (KCNH2, HRH1).
Related Gene Names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, KCNH2, HRH1. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with an amide group (C(=O)N) attached, which suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
