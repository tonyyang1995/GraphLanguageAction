Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH2+]Cc1ccc(-c2cc(-c3nc(-c4ccc(S(=O)(=O)C(C)C)cc4)c[n-]c3=N)on2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this might be important.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (NH2+), which suggests it could interact with receptors that have negatively charged sites. This feature is relevant to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, all of which are involved in signaling through G-proteins.
Step 2: The molecule also has a sulfonamide group (-S(=O)(=O)C(C)C), which could form hydrogen bonds and potentially bind to enzymes or receptors that contain polar amino acid residues. This feature is relevant to CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The presence of a pyrrolidine ring (-c2cc(-c3nc(-c4ccc(S(=O)(=O)C(C)C)cc4)c[n-]c3=N)on2) suggests potential interactions with proteins that have similar structural motifs. This feature is relevant to CYP3A4, which is another cytochrome P450 enzyme involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: The molecule includes a benzene ring system, which can form π-π stacking interactions with other aromatic compounds. This feature is relevant to genes involved in cellular signaling pathways, such as PTGS1, which encodes the enzyme cyclooxygenase-1, involved in prostaglandin synthesis.
Step 5: The overall structure of the molecule, including its aromatic and heteroaromatic rings, could interact with a variety of proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, such as HRH1 and HTR1A, which are involved in histamine and serotonin signaling, respectively.
