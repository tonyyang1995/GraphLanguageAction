Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C=CC(=O)Nc1cccc(Oc2[n-]c(=Nc3ccc(N4CC[NH+](C)CC4)cc3)nc3ccsc23)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this information might be useful.
Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring with a ketone group, amide, and a substituted nitrogen atom. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes that metabolize drugs and other xenobiotics, such as those encoded by CYP (Cytochrome P450) genes.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule indicates it could potentially interact with receptors or transport proteins that have amino groups, such as those encoded by genes involved in neurotransmission and receptor signaling, like HTR (Histoamine Transporter Receptor) and CHRM (Cholinergic Receptor) genes.
Step 3: The substitution of the nitrogen atom with a hydroxyl group (Oc2) implies the molecule may have chiral centers and could interact with proteins that recognize or bind to stereoisomers, such as those encoded by genes like KCNH2 (Potassium Voltage-Gated Channel Subfamily H Member 2).
Step 4: The molecule's overall structure, including the presence of multiple functional groups and rings, suggests it could be a substrate for enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4.
Step 5: Given the complexity and the presence of amine and carbonyl functionalities, the molecule might also interact with enzymes or receptors involved in G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathways, which are encoded by genes such as DRD2, HTR2A, and HTR2B.
