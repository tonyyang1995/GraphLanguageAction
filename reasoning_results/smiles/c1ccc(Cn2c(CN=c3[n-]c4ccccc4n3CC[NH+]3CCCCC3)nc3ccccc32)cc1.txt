Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: c1ccc(Cn2c(CN=c3[n-]c4ccccc4n3CC[NH+]3CCCCC3)nc3ccccc32)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples or additional unnecessary information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a tricyclic core structure with a nitrogen atom, which is characteristic of certain ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature suggests potential interaction with GPCRs.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen-nitrogen double bond and an amide group indicates possible activity as a modulator of ion channels or neurotransmitter receptors, given the functional groups involved in such interactions.
Step 3: The aromatic ring systems present in the molecule may interact with DNA-binding proteins or enzymes that have binding sites for aromatic compounds, such as those encoded by CYP enzymes.
Step 4: The presence of a benzene ring and other hydrophobic moieties could indicate potential binding to drug transporters like those encoded by the ABCB1 gene, which encodes P-glycoprotein.
Step 5: Given the diverse functional groups and the potential for interaction with various biological targets, the molecule is most likely related to multiple genes including ABCB1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and possibly others encoding GPCRs and transporters. Summary of related genes: ABCB1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. Step 5: Summary of related genes: ABCB1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
