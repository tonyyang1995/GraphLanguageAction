Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: c1cc(-c2cnn3cc(-c4ccc(OCC[NH+]5CCCCC5)cc4)cnc23)ccn1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule contains a complex structure with multiple functional groups, including amine (-NH2), hydroxyl (-OH), and carboxylic acid (-COOH) functionalities. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for such functional groups.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a benzene ring system, which is a common feature in many ligands that interact with receptors and enzymes. Benzene rings are often involved in forming stable complexes with proteins through aromatic interactions.
Step 3: Given the presence of a pyridine ring (part of the CYP2D6 enzyme's active site) and the overall structure, there is a possibility that this molecule could interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2D6, due to its potential to bind to the catalytic site of these enzymes.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule’s structure could potentially interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to its length and the presence of basic and polar functional groups, which are characteristic of many GPCR ligands.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and potential interactions, the related genes are likely to be those involved in drug metabolism (CYP2D6) and neurotransmission (such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and DRD2).
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2D6
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- DRD2 Step 5: Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2
These genes are related to the molecule due to their involvement in drug metabolism and neurotransmission processes, which are influenced by compounds with similar structures.
