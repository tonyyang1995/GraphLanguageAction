Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: c1cncc(C[NH2+]Cc2cccnc2)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule containing nitrogen and carbon atoms, with potential aromatic and heteroaromatic rings. This structure suggests that the molecule could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction, neurotransmission, and other cellular processes due to its functional groups such as amine (-NH2) and carbonyl (-CO) functionalities.
Step 2: The presence of an amine group (-NH2) at position C2 of the benzene ring indicates the possibility of the molecule being an agonist or antagonist for receptors that bind amine compounds, such as adrenergic and cholinergic receptors. This is relevant to genes encoding these receptors, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a cyano (-CN) group and a nitro (-NO2) group within the molecule might suggest it has potential to modulate enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). These enzymes are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 4: The overall structure also hints at possible interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels, given the presence of aromatic rings and hydrophobic regions. Genes associated with these targets include HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, and LCK.
Step 5: Based on the chemical structure and potential functional groups, the related genes are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, LCK.
