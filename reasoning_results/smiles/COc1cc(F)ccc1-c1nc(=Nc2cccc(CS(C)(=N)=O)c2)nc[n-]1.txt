Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc(F)ccc1-c1nc(=Nc2cccc(CS(C)(=N)=O)c2)nc[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a fused ring system with a benzene ring (CO), a furan ring (F), and a pyrrole ring (c1cc(F)ccc1). This complex structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes that metabolize drugs or other small molecules, such as those encoded by CYP (cytochrome P450) genes.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a nitrile group (-N=C=O) and a sulfonamide moiety (-NS(C)(=N)=O). These functional groups are often recognized by receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways. For example, the nitrile group could interact with ion channels or receptors like GPCRs, while the sulfonamide might bind to enzymes or transporters.
Step 3: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a nitro group (-NO2) further indicates potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism and signaling. Specifically, these functional groups may be recognized by enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize drugs containing similar groups.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule has a pyridine ring (c1nc(=Nc2cccc(CS(C)(=N)=O)c2)nc[n-]1), which is common in many drugs and can interact with various proteins, including receptors and ion channels. This structure is particularly relevant to genes encoding for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, and HRH1, which are involved in neurotransmission and mood regulation.
Step 5: Considering the complex structure and functional groups present in the molecule, it is likely to have multiple interactions with several genes. However, based on the specific features identified, the most relevant genes include CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HRH1, and possibly others related to GPCRs or drug metabolism.
