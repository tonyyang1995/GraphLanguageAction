Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+]1CC[NH+](CCCN2c3ccccc3Sc3ccc(Cl)cc32)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains multiple aromatic rings and a nitrogen atom with positive charge, which suggests it may interact with proteins involved in signal transduction or receptor binding.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and amine groups could indicate potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 3: The nitrogen atom with positive charge might also suggest interactions with ion channels or transporters, possibly related to KCNH2 (hERG potassium channel) or SLC6A4 (serotonin transporter).
Step 4: Given the complexity of the molecule and its potential to modulate various signaling pathways, it could have indirect effects on genes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism or signaling, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and PTGS1 (COX-1).
Step 5: Considering the diverse structural elements and functional groups in the molecule, it is likely to have a broader impact on multiple genes, including but not limited to those involved in GPCR signaling (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), ion channel modulation (KCNH2), and neurotransmitter regulation (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, PTGS1).
