Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples.
Step 1: The SMILES string Cn1cc[n-]c1=S represents a molecule with a nitrogen atom that has an unpaired electron, indicating it is a radical. This nitrogen is part of a heterocyclic ring system, which includes a benzene ring and a pyrrole ring. The presence of sulfur and the double bond to nitrogen suggest the molecule may be involved in redox reactions or could act as a nucleophile or electrophile in biochemical processes.
Step 2: The molecule's structure, particularly the presence of a nitrogen with a negative charge (-) and the aromatic rings, suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways and neurotransmitter systems. The nitrogen's negative charge could make it a good candidate for binding to proteins with positively charged residues or for participating in hydrogen bonding.
Step 3: Considering the molecular structure and its potential for interacting with proteins, the molecule could potentially interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), enzymes involved in metabolic pathways, and ion channels. Specific GPCRs include those involved in adrenergic and cholinergic signaling, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4. Additionally, the molecule might interact with enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: Furthermore, the molecule's ability to participate in redox reactions or act as a nucleophile/electrophile could make it relevant to genes involved in stress responses, such as HTR2A and HTR2B, which are associated with serotonin receptors and could be affected by oxidative stress. It also could have implications for genes involved in inflammatory responses, such as PTGS1, which codes for COX-2, an enzyme involved in prostaglandin synthesis.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and potential interactions, the related genes are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A, HTR2B, and PTGS1. These genes are primarily involved in neurotransmitter signaling, metabolism, and stress responses. 
Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A, HTR2B, PTGS1.
