Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCCCCC(=O)CCc1ccc([O-])c(OC)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a structure that includes a benzene ring (represented by C8) connected to an amide group (C(=O)N). This structure suggests it could be a drug-like compound, potentially interacting with proteins involved in signaling pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a negatively charged oxygen atom (-[O-]) and an alcohol group (OC) indicates the molecule might have ion channel modulating or receptor binding properties. Benzene rings often interact with transmembrane proteins like ion channels or receptors.
Step 3: The pattern of the molecule does not directly align with any known structural motifs for enzymes such as those coded by CYP (cytochrome P450) or other metabolic enzymes listed, which typically involve hydroxyl groups, double bonds, or aromatic rings in specific configurations.
Step 4: Given the potential for receptor binding or ion channel modulation, the molecule could interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels. Genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4 code for GPCRs, while KCNH2 codes for a voltage-gated potassium channel.
Step 5: The molecule may also influence enzymes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism or signaling, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are involved in serotonin signaling, and PTGS1, which encodes COX-1, an enzyme in prostaglandin synthesis.
Summary of related gene names:
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- ADRB2
- CHRM1
- CHRM3
- CHRM4
- DRD2
- DRD3
- DRD4
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- HTR6
- PTGS1
Note: Some genes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and SLC6A4 are involved in metabolism and transport but do not seem to have a direct interaction based on the given molecular structure. Therefore, they are not included in the list of related genes. The focus is on those that could plausibly interact with the molecule's structure.
