Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cccc(C(CC(=O)Nc2cccc3ccccc23)NC(=O)c2ccccc2)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system and a quinoline ring fused to it. This complex aromatic structure is often found in drugs that interact with receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a piperidine ring attached to the quinoline structure suggests the molecule could be an agonist or antagonist for certain G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are known to be regulated by various genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule includes a pyridine ring and a cyano group, which are common in compounds that inhibit enzymes like CYP2D6 and CYP2C9. These enzymes are crucial in drug metabolism, and their activity is regulated by the genes CYP2D6 and CYP2C9.
Step 4: The quinoline and benzene rings also suggest potential interactions with voltage-gated calcium channels, which are encoded by genes like CACNA1H. This indicates the molecule might have effects on calcium signaling pathways.
Step 5: Considering the complex structure and the presence of functional groups that could interact with both receptors and enzymes, the molecule is likely to be related to the genes encoding GPCRs (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), enzymes involved in drug metabolism (CYP2D6, CYP2C9), and calcium channel proteins (CACNA1H).
