Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[N+]1(C)CCC(=C(c2ccccc2)c2ccccc2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples or additional text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge, indicated by [N+]. This feature suggests potential interactions with receptors that have negatively charged sites for ligand binding, such as ion channels or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 2: The molecule also includes a benzene ring (C6H6) attached to the nitrogen atom, which could interact with aromatic amino acids in receptor binding sites, particularly those involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 3: The presence of multiple alkyl chains (e.g., -C-C-C-) and cyclohexane rings in the molecule might indicate a structural similarity to ligands that bind to receptors like adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), which are known to interact with fatty acid-like molecules.
Step 4: Given the complex structure and potential for interaction with various receptors, the molecule may also show affinity for enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, due to its functional groups and hydrophobic regions.
Step 5: Considering the potential interactions with receptors and metabolic enzymes, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. 
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
