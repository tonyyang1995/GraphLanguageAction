Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccccc1CNC(=O)CSc1nc2nc(C)cc(C)n2n1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound that includes aromatic rings (indicated by the presence of 'c' in the SMILES string), a benzene ring with a cyano group (-CN), and a cyclic amide structure (indicated by 'N' and '=' in the SMILES string). This structural complexity suggests the molecule could interact with various biological targets, including enzymes and receptors.
Step 2: The molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) and a cyclic amide, which are functional groups known to be involved in binding to enzymes and receptors. Specifically, the cyano group can act as an electrophile and participate in covalent binding, while the cyclic amide can form hydrogen bonds, contributing to non-covalent interactions.
Step 3: Considering the molecular structure, the molecule might interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These enzymes are part of the cytochrome P450 family and play crucial roles in the metabolism of xenobiotics and endogenous compounds.
Step 4: The cyclic amide and aromatic structures also suggest potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are often targeted by drugs due to their role in signal transduction pathways. Therefore, the molecule could potentially interact with receptors like DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), HTR2A (Serotonin receptor 5-HT2A), and HRH1 (Histamine receptor H1).
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structural features and potential interactions, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A, and HRH1. These genes encode enzymes and receptors that are involved in drug metabolism and signaling pathways, making them relevant to the molecule's potential biological activity.
