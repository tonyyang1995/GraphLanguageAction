Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1nn(CC(=O)NCC[NH+]2CCOCC2)c(C)c1[N+](=O)[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with several functional groups including amide, ester, and aromatic rings, which are common in drug-like molecules designed to interact with receptors or enzymes. This complexity suggests the molecule could potentially interact with multiple biological targets.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-CONH-) and an ester group (-COOR-) indicates that this molecule might have activity against enzymes involved in metabolism or signaling pathways, such as CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are known to metabolize drugs and other xenobiotics.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a quinolone ring system, which is characteristic of drugs that act as inhibitors or agonists of various receptors and ion channels. For instance, it could target G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4, as well as ion channels like KCNH2 and LCK.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule’s overall structure might allow it to interact with kinases, such as CDK2 and LCK, given the presence of hydrophobic and polar regions that can stabilize protein-ligand interactions.
Step 5: Based on the above structural analysis, the molecule could be related to several genes including CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, KCNH2, and LCK.
