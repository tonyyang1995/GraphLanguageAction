Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc2cccc(CCNC(C)=O)c2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule, represented by the SMILES string COc1ccc2cccc(CCNC(C)=O)c2c1, contains a benzene ring with an attached indole group and a pyrrole ring fused to it. This structure suggests the molecule could be a ligand for receptors or enzymes that interact with aromatic compounds.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the pyrrole ring indicates potential amine functionality, which is common in ligands for receptors such as adrenergic (ADRA1D, ADRA2B) and dopaminergic (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) receptors. These receptors are involved in neurotransmission and are known to bind small molecules with amine groups.
Step 3: The molecule also has a cyano group (-CN) attached to the benzene ring, which could suggest interactions with enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These enzymes are involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics and drugs, and they often recognize and modify molecules containing cyano or similar functional groups.
Step 4: The presence of a ketone group (C=O) and a carbonyl group (C=O) in the molecule could indicate binding to enzymes such as CYP3A4, which is known to metabolize a wide range of substrates, including those with ketone or carbonyl functionalities. Additionally, this feature might also be relevant for interactions with receptors like G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), where such functional groups are common.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. These genes encode proteins involved in receptor function and drug metabolism, making them relevant targets for this molecule.
Summary of related gene names:
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- DRD2
- DRD3
- DRD4
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
These genes are involved in receptor signaling and drug metabolism, which aligns with the molecular structure described.
