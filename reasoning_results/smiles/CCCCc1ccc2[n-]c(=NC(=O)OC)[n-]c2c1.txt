Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCc1ccc2[n-]c(=NC(=O)OC)[n-]c2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains multiple nitrogen atoms and a benzene ring system, which suggests it could interact with receptors or transport proteins that have similar structural motifs.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of a nitro group (-N[double bond]N) and amine groups could indicate potential interactions with cholinergic receptors, given their affinity for such functional groups.
Step 3: Given the pattern of substituents around the nitrogen atoms, particularly the nitro group and the carboxamide, this molecule might interact with receptors like CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4, which are known to bind to acetylcholine and have similar functional groups.
Step 4: The molecule also has a structure that could potentially interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), specifically those involved in neurotransmission, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, due to the presence of aromatic rings and heteroatoms.
Step 5: Based on the structure and functional groups present, the related genes include: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C.
