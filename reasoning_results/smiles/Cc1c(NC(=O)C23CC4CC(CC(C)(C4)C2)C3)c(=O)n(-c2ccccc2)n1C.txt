Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1c(NC(=O)C23CC4CC(CC(C)(C4)C2)C3)c(=O)n(-c2ccccc2)n1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom within a cyclic structure, specifically in the form of an amide (NC(=O)). This feature is indicative of potential interactions with enzymes that metabolize drugs, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and a carboxamide group (C23CC4CC(CC(C)(C4)C2)) suggests possible binding to receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmission or hormone regulation. This could relate to genes like DRD2, HTR2A, and CYP3A4.
Step 3: The molecule includes a nitrile group (c1c(-c2ccccc2)n1C), which may interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP1A2.
Step 4: The overall structure, including multiple aromatic rings and heteroatoms, might suggest interactions with kinases or other proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, potentially linking to genes like LCK and PTGS1.
Step 5: Given the complex structure and the presence of functional groups that can interact with various biological targets, the molecule could be related to multiple genes involved in different pathways, including receptor signaling and metabolic processes.
