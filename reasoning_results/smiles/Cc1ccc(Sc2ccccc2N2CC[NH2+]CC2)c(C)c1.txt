Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(Sc2ccccc2N2CC[NH2+]CC2)c(C)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure containing multiple rings, including a benzene ring, a pyrrole ring, and a thiophene ring. These aromatic rings are often involved in interactions with proteins that have hydrophobic binding pockets, such as those found in membrane receptors and transporters.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom within the molecule, particularly in the thiophene ring, suggests potential for interaction with enzymes that metabolize drugs and other small molecules, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs). This is indicated by the presence of CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 in the list of genes provided.
Step 3: The molecule also contains an amine group (-NH2), which could be involved in interactions with ion channels and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) through hydrogen bonding or electrostatic interactions. This is supported by the presence of ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C in the list of genes.
Step 4: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) might indicate the molecule could interact with ion channels or transporters that bind acidic compounds, like those encoded by KCNH2, CACNA1H, and SIGMAR1.
Step 5: Given the complexity of the molecule and its potential to interact with multiple types of proteins, it is likely to affect several of the listed genes, including CYP1A2, CYP3A4, PTGS1, and OPARK1, which are involved in drug metabolism and signaling pathways.
Summary of Related Genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, CACNA1H, SIGMAR1, PTGS1, OPARK1.
