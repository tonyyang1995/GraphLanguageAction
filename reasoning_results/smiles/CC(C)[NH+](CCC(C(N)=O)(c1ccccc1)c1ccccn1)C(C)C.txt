Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)[NH+](CCC(C(N)=O)(c1ccccc1)c1ccccn1)C(C)C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule containing multiple functional groups such as an amine (NH+), carboxylic acid (C(=O)), and aromatic rings (c1ccccc1). This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for small molecules, particularly those involved in neurotransmission and signaling.
Step 2: Analyzing the molecular structure, we observe the presence of a positively charged amine group (NH+) and a carboxylic acid group (C(=O)). These functional groups are known to interact with receptors that bind ligands, such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels. Given this, the molecule could potentially interact with receptors listed in the gene list, specifically those involved in neurotransmission.
Step 3: Among the listed genes, several are known to encode for receptors and enzymes that interact with small molecules. For instance, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 are all GPCRs involved in serotonin signaling, while CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 are cytochrome P450 enzymes that metabolize drugs. The positively charged amine group and the carboxylic acid could interact with these receptors and enzymes, suggesting potential relationships.
Step 4: The aromatic rings in the molecule (c1ccccc1) might also interact with ion channels, such as KCNH2, which encodes the HERG potassium channel. This interaction could affect the function of the ion channel, leading to changes in cellular signaling.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and the functional groups present, the molecule could be related to the following genes: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and KCNH2.
Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- HTR6
- CYP2D6
- CYP2C9
- KCNH2
These genes are involved in neurotransmission, drug metabolism, and ion channel function, which aligns with the structural features of the molecule described by the SMILES string.
