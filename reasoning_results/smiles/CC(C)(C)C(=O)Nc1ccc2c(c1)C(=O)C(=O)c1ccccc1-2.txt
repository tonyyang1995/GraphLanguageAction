Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(c1)C(=O)C(=O)c1ccccc1-2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple functional groups including an amide (N-C=O), a carboxylic acid (C=O-OH), and a benzene ring system. The presence of these functional groups suggests potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for similar chemical moieties.
Step 2: The benzene ring system in the molecule is reminiscent of the structure of many ligands that bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural similarity implies that the molecule could interact with GPCRs, which are encoded by genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4. These genes encode for different subtypes of adrenergic and cholinergic receptors and dopamine receptors, respectively.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a carboxylic acid group and amide functionality may indicate potential interactions with enzymes or transporters that recognize these functional groups. For example, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in drug metabolism, which might interact with the molecule. Similarly, SLC6A2 and SLC6A4 are sodium-dependent neurotransmitter transporters that could potentially bind this molecule.
Step 4: Furthermore, the molecule's structure might also suggest interactions with other genes involved in signaling pathways, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode serotonin receptors. Serotonin receptors play crucial roles in various physiological processes, including mood regulation, pain perception, and sleep.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the molecule could be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6. These genes are primarily associated with neurotransmission, receptor binding, and drug metabolism. 
List of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
