Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(C(=O)[NH+]2c3ccccc3CC2C)cc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with a carbonyl group (CO) and a nitrogen atom with a positive charge ([NH+]2), which suggests it is an amide or ester derivative potentially involved in protein-protein interactions.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom with a positive charge indicates that this molecule could act as a ligand for receptors that bind positively charged molecules, such as certain G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: Among the provided genes, several are known to encode for GPCRs including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, all of which are involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 4: The molecule’s structure also aligns with potential substrates or inhibitors for enzymes such as CYP2D6, which is known to metabolize a variety of drugs and xenobiotics, suggesting the molecule might interact with this enzyme.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and potential interactions, the molecule is likely to be related to the genes encoding GPCRs (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) and the CYP2D6 gene.
