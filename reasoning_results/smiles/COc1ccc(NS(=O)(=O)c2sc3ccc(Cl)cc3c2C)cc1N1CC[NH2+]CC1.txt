Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(NS(=O)(=O)c2sc3ccc(Cl)cc3c2C)cc1N1CC[NH2+]CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitro group (NS(=O)(=O)c2sc3ccc(Cl)cc3c2C) which is a functional group known to interact with various enzymes involved in drug metabolism. This suggests potential interactions with genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a quinoline ring system (COc1ccc(NS(=O)(=O)c2sc3ccc(Cl)cc3c2C)cc1) indicates the molecule could be an inhibitor or substrate for enzymes involved in Phase I reactions such as cytochrome P450s (CYP enzymes), particularly CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 3: The molecule also has a pyrrolidine ring (N1CC[NH2+]CC1) which may interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or ion channels. This could relate to genes like DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are involved in neurotransmitter signaling.
Step 4: The overall structure includes aromatic rings and heteroatoms, which can modulate ion channels and receptors. This structural feature may interact with genes such as KCNH2, which encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel.
Step 5: Considering the functional groups and overall structure, the molecule is most likely to be related to genes involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmission, including CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and KCNH2.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2.
