Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(CCCCCCC(O)=NO)Nc1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a structure that includes an amide (N-C=O), a carboxyl group (COOH), and a benzene ring (C6H6). This structure suggests it could be a small molecule drug or a ligand that interacts with proteins, particularly those involved in neurotransmission or signaling pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom within the benzene ring (indicated by the double bond to oxygen and the amide group) is characteristic of molecules like imidazoles, which are known to interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This indicates potential interaction with receptors that have similar functional groups.
Step 3: Considering the genes listed, several are associated with GPCRs or enzymes that could interact with such a chemical structure. Specifically, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 are all GPCRs that could potentially bind to this molecule due to their amino acid sequences and binding sites.
Step 4: Additionally, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 are enzymes that play roles in the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics, including small molecules with aromatic rings and amide groups. These enzymes could metabolize the molecule, affecting its pharmacokinetics and potentially altering its interactions with other genes.
Step 5: Based on the structural features of the molecule and the gene functions described, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19.
