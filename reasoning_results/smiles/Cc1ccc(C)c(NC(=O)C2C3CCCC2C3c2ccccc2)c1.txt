Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(C)c(NC(=O)C2C3CCCC2C3c2ccccc2)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound with multiple rings and functional groups, including a benzene ring, a pyrrole ring, a carboxamide group (-CONH2), and a cyano group (-CN). The presence of these structural features suggests that this molecule may interact with proteins involved in signal transduction, receptor binding, or enzymatic activity.
Step 2: Among the given genes, those encoding receptors and enzymes are more likely to have a direct interaction with this molecule due to its functional groups. Specifically, the carboxamide group could interact with ion channels or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), while the benzene and pyrrole rings might interact with protein binding sites.
Step 3: The gene HTR2A encodes the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, which is a GPCR that can bind to various ligands, including some with a carboxamide group. The molecule's structure could potentially fit into the binding pocket of this receptor, leading to either activation or inhibition depending on the exact nature of the interactions.
Step 4: Another relevant gene is CYP2D6, which encodes a cytochrome P450 enzyme responsible for metabolizing many drugs. The cyano group (-CN) in the molecule could serve as a substrate for this enzyme, making CYP2D6 a potential target for studying drug metabolism involving this molecule.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and the potential interactions described above, the related genes include: HTR2A, CYP2D6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and CYP2C19. These genes encode receptors and enzymes that may be directly affected by the molecule's presence or metabolic processes.
