Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that contains a quinoline ring system, a pyrrolidine ring, and a carboxamide group. This structure suggests the molecule could be an agonist or antagonist for receptors that interact with such functional groups.
Step 2: Looking at the gene list, several genes are related to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which often bind small molecules with similar functional groups. Specifically, the molecule's carboxamide and amide functionalities are characteristic of ligands that can interact with these receptors. Potential related genes include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, and ADRB2, all of which encode for GPCRs involved in various physiological processes.
Step 3: The presence of a quinoline ring in the molecule also indicates it might interact with enzymes or transporters that have binding sites for aromatic compounds. Genes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which encode cytochrome P450 enzymes, could be relevant due to their role in metabolizing drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure might influence its interaction with ion channels, given the presence of the carboxamide group, which could modulate the activity of voltage-gated potassium channels. CNCNAR1H and KCNH2 are two genes encoding for potassium channels that might be affected by this molecule.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis and the potential interactions described above, the related genes for the molecule are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CNCNAR1H, and KCNH2. These genes are primarily involved in GPCR signaling, drug metabolism, and ion channel function.
