Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cn1c(SCc2nnc(-c3ccc(F)cc3)o2)nnc1C1COc2ccccc2O1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple rings and functional groups, including a benzene ring, heterocyclic rings (thiophene), and hydroxyl and fluorine substituents. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes and receptors that are involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmission.
Step 2: The presence of a thiophene ring and hydroxyl group could indicate potential interaction with enzymes such as cytochrome P450s (CYPs), which are known to metabolize drugs through oxidation reactions involving hydroxylation. Specifically, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 are involved in the metabolism of various drugs and may interact with this molecule.
Step 3: The presence of a benzene ring and hydroxyl group also suggests potential interactions with receptors that bind to aromatic compounds and can be activated by hydroxylation. Receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) might be affected due to their ligand-binding domains often containing aromatic residues.
Step 4: The molecule's structure does not suggest direct interactions with genes encoding for kinases (e.g., LCK, KDR), ion channels (e.g., KCNH2), or other proteins that do not typically interact with aromatic compounds or hydroxylation products.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is most likely to be related to the following genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4. These genes encode enzymes and receptors that are involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmission, making them plausible targets for the described molecule.
