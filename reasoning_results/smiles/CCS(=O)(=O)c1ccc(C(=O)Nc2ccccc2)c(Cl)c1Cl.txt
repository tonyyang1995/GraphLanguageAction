Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)c(Cl)c1Cl, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule has a structure that includes a benzene ring, an oxazole group, and multiple substituents such as chlorine atoms and amide groups. This type of structure is commonly found in molecules that interact with receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: Among the given genes, several are known to encode for receptors or enzymes that could potentially interact with this type of molecular structure. For instance, the CYP (cytochrome P450) family of genes, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, encode enzymes involved in drug metabolism. These enzymes might interact with the molecule due to its functional groups like the amide and oxazole moieties.
Step 3: Additionally, some genes encode for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which often have binding sites for small molecules. Genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4 all encode GPCRs. The presence of a benzene ring and amide groups suggests potential interaction with these receptors, especially if they are involved in neurotransmission or hormone signaling pathways.
Step 4: Another class of genes that might be related are those encoding for kinases, such as LCK (Src family kinase). The molecule's structure does not directly suggest a strong interaction with kinases, but it could potentially modulate kinase activity indirectly through its effects on downstream signaling pathways.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the genes related to the molecule include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
