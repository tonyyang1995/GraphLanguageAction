Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCc1nn(C)c2c(=O)[n-]c(-c3cc(S(=O)(=O)[NH+]4CC[NH+](C)CC4)ccc3OCC)nc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains several functional groups including amine (-NH2), alcohol (-OH), ester (C=O), and aromatic rings (cyclohexane-like structures). These functional groups are common in molecules that interact with receptors and enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: Notably, the molecule includes a sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)[NH+]4) and a carboxylic acid group (CC[c]=O), which are characteristic of drugs that target ion channels, receptors, and enzymes. Specifically, the sulfonamide and carboxylic acid groups suggest potential interactions with proteins that have these functional groups as binding sites.
Step 3: Given the presence of multiple functional groups and the overall structure, this molecule likely interacts with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or ion channels, as these classes of proteins often bind small molecules with similar functional groups and complex structures.
Step 4: GPCRs and ion channels are associated with several of the listed genes, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CACNA1H, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes encode receptors that respond to various ligands and neurotransmitters.
Step 5: Ion channels and GPCRs also involve genes like KCNH2 and SIGMAR1, which code for potassium channels and sigma receptors, respectively. Additionally, the molecule’s structure could potentially interact with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those coded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, due to the presence of functional groups that could serve as substrates for these enzymes.
