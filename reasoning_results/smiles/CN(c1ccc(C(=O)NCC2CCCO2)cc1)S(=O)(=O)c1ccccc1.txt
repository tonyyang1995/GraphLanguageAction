Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CN(c1ccc(C(=O)NCC2CCCO2)cc1)S(=O)(=O)c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with a cyano group and an ester moiety. This structural pattern is relevant to several drug targets, including enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group and an ester moiety suggests potential interactions with enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a sulfonate ester group, which could interact with proteins like CYP2D6, another enzyme involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: Given the molecular structure and its potential for metabolic interactions, the genes related to these enzymes include CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6.
Step 5: Additional genes potentially affected by the molecule’s pharmacological properties might include ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein), which is involved in drug efflux, and SLC6A4 (norepinephrine transporter), which may be modulated by certain molecules.
