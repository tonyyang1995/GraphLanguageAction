Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=N[NH+](CCCl)C(=O)NCCCl, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitroimidazole ring system (O=N), which is a common pharmacophore in drugs targeting certain enzymes and receptors.
Step 2: The molecule also has a quinoline-like structure (CCCl)C(=O)NCCCl, which is often found in compounds that interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Step 3: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH+) suggests potential interactions with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other membrane-bound proteins.
Step 4: The overall structure indicates possible interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 5: Given the potential for interaction with metabolic enzymes and GPCRs, the related genes include CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and SLC6A4.
