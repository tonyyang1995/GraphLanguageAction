Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NC(=O)c1ccc(-c2n[n-]c(=Nc3ccc(OC(F)(F)Cl)cc3)c3ccccc23)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that contains a core structure with a pyrrolidine ring fused to an imidazole ring, which is connected to a phenyl ring. This structure is characteristic of certain types of ligands that can interact with receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of functional groups such as amide (-CONH2), nitrile (CN), and halogen (Cl) in the molecule suggests that it could potentially interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, as these functional groups are often found in molecules that modulate receptor activity.
Step 3: Given the presence of a nitrile group and the overall structure, this molecule may have potential to act as a ligand for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are known to be influenced by various ligands and play crucial roles in neurotransmission and hormone signaling. Specific examples include adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Step 4: The molecule also contains a benzene ring with a trifluoromethyl group (CF3) and a chlorine atom (Cl), which could influence its pharmacokinetic properties and binding affinity to certain enzymes. This could suggest a possible interaction with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
Step 5: Considering the structural features and potential interactions, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These genes encode proteins that are directly involved in the molecular targets of the described molecule or are responsible for metabolizing it within the body.
