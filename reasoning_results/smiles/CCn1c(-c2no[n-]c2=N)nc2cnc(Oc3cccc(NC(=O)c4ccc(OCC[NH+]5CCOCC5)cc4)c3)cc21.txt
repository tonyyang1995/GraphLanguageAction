Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCn1c(-c2no[n-]c2=N)nc2cnc(Oc3cccc(NC(=O)c4ccc(OCC[NH+]5CCOCC5)cc4)c3)cc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound with multiple functional groups including a nitrogen atom with a negative charge, an amide group, and an aromatic ring. These features suggest the molecule could interact with proteins involved in signaling pathways or transport processes.
Step 2: Looking at the provided gene list, several genes are related to neurotransmitter receptors or enzymes that might interact with molecules containing these functional groups. For instance, HTR1A (serotonin receptor), HTR2A (serotonin receptor), and DRD2 (dopamine receptor) all encode for G-protein coupled receptors which could potentially bind to the amine and aromatic groups of the molecule.
Step 3: The molecule also has an amide group (-CO-NH-) which could interact with enzymes like CYP2D6 (cytochrome P450), an important drug-metabolizing enzyme, suggesting potential interactions with this gene.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of an oxygen-containing functional group (like in the amide and the alcohol group in the benzene ring) suggests possible interactions with enzymes such as PTGS1 (cyclooxygenase), which is involved in prostaglandin synthesis.
Step 5: Based on the molecule’s structure and its potential interaction sites, the related genes include: HTR1A, HTR2A, DRD2, CYP2D6, and PTGS1.
Summary of related gene names: HTR1A, HTR2A, DRD2, CYP2D6, PTGS1.
