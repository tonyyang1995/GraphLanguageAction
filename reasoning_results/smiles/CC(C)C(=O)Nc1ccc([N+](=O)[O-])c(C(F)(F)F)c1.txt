Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])c(C(F)(F)F)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a benzene ring with an amide group attached (CC(C)C(=O)). This suggests it could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes that interact with such functional groups, like cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Step 2: The molecule also contains a tricyclic structure with a nitrogen atom carrying a positive charge and an attached negatively charged oxygen (Nc1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])c(C(F)(F)F)c1). This pattern is characteristic of certain types of drugs, particularly those that act as ligands for receptors or ion channels.
Step 3: Considering the presence of the tricyclic structure and the positively charged nitrogen, this molecule might interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are often involved in signaling pathways controlled by such ligands.
Step 4: Among the given genes, several are known to encode for GPCRs, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These receptors are involved in various physiological processes such as neurotransmission and hormone signaling.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule's structure could potentially interact with enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6. Step 1: The molecule has a benzene ring with an amide group attached (CC(C)C(=O)), indicating potential interactions with enzymes that metabolize similar compounds.
Step 2: It includes a tricyclic structure with a positively charged nitrogen and a negatively charged oxygen (Nc1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])c(C(F)(F)F)c1), which is typical of ligands for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: Given its tricyclic structure and charge distribution, the molecule likely interacts with GPCRs, such as those encoded by ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 4: The molecule may also interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, specifically CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 5: Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6.
