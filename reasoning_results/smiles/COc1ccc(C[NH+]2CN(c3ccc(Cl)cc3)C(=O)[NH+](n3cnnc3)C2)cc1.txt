Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(C[NH+]2CN(c3ccc(Cl)cc3)C(=O)[NH+](n3cnnc3)C2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a quinoline ring system, which is often found in ligands for nuclear receptors and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This suggests potential interactions with genes involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a pyrrolidine ring and amide functionalities indicates the molecule could be an agonist or antagonist for certain GPCRs. Notably, this matches the structure of some known drugs that interact with receptors like DRD2 (Dopamine D2 receptor), HTR2A (Serotonin 5-HT2A receptor), and CHRM1-4 (Cholinergic receptors).
Step 3: The molecule also includes a benzene ring with substituents such as chlorine and amide groups, which are common in substrates for enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, suggesting possible metabolism-related interactions with these genes.
Step 4: The overall structure does not strongly suggest direct interaction with transporters like SLC6A2 or SLC6A4, or with enzymes like CYP1A2, but it could potentially modulate their activity through indirect mechanisms.
Step 5: Given the molecular features, the most likely related genes are those involved in neurotransmitter signaling and metabolism, including DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. Step 6: Summary of related genes: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4.
