Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Fc1ccc(-n2cc(CCCC[NH+]3CCC4(CC3)OCc3ccccc34)c3ccccc32)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains several functional groups such as amide (NH+), phenyl (Fc), and cyclic structures, which are common in many drug molecules. These features suggest that the molecule could interact with proteins involved in various physiological processes, including neurotransmission, signal transduction, and enzyme activity.
Step 2: Notably, the molecule has a cyclic amide group (N-H+) that might be relevant to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to their binding sites often featuring hydrogen-bonding functionalities. This is particularly pertinent for receptors like DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are involved in serotonin and dopamine signaling pathways.
Step 3: The cyclic nature of the molecule and its substituents may also suggest interactions with enzymes, such as those involved in phase I metabolism (e.g., CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). These enzymes are responsible for the oxidation of drugs and xenobiotics, and the molecule’s structure could potentially modulate their activity.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of aromatic rings and possibly hydrophobic regions in the molecule might indicate interactions with transporters, such as SLC6A2 and SLC6A4, which are known to mediate the uptake of monoamines into neurons.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis and the potential interactions discussed, the related genes include: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4. These genes are primarily involved in neurotransmission, drug metabolism, and ion channel regulation.
