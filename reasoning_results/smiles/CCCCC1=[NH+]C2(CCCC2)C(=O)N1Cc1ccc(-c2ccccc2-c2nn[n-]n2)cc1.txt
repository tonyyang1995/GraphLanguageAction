Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCC1=[NH+]C2(CCCC2)C(=O)N1Cc1ccc(-c2ccccc2-c2nn[n-]n2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, specifically a tricyclic amide structure with a nitrogen atom bearing a positive charge. This structural feature suggests potential interaction with receptors that bind to or are modulated by such chemical structures.
Step 2: The presence of aromatic rings and heteroatoms like nitrogen can activate or inhibit enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP (cytochrome P450) genes. Notably, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are known to metabolize a wide range of drugs including those with similar structures.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a quinoline-like moiety (-c2ccccc2), which can interact with ion channels and receptors. This could be relevant for genes encoding ion channels or receptors that share similar binding sites, such as KCNH2 (hERG potassium channel).
Step 4: The overall structure may also influence G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), given its complex shape and potential to form stable interactions with these proteins. Relevant genes include HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which encode serotonin receptors.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes are CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, KCNH2, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C. 
Summary of related genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, KCNH2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C.
