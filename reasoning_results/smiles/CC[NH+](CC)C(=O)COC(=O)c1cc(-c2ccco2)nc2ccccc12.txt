Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC[NH+](CC)C(=O)COC(=O)c1cc(-c2ccco2)nc2ccccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure that includes an amide group (-CONH), a pyrrolidine ring, a benzene ring, and a number of hydrocarbon chains. This structure suggests it could interact with proteins that have binding sites for similar functional groups or motifs.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-CONH) and the benzene ring are common features in ligands that can bind to receptors such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs often have binding pockets that can accommodate aromatic rings and amide functionalities.
Step 3: The pattern of the molecule indicates potential interactions with genes encoding GPCRs. Specifically, the molecule could potentially interact with genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which all encode GPCRs.
Step 4: The molecule also has a pyrrolidine ring and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which might suggest interactions with enzymes or other proteins involved in metabolic pathways. Genes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which encode cytochrome P450 enzymes, could be relevant here due to their ability to metabolize compounds with similar structures.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and functional groups of the molecule, the most likely related genes include those encoding GPCRs and enzymes involved in metabolism. The related gene names are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
