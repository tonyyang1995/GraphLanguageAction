Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)c1sc(=NS(=O)(=O)c2ccccc2)[n-]c1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups including an amide (N=O), a sulfonyl (S(=O)(=O)), a carbonyl (C=O), and aromatic rings. These functional groups are common in drug-like molecules that interact with receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of the amide group and the sulfonyl group suggests that this molecule could be an inhibitor or activator of enzymes that contain catalytic sites for these functional groups, such as CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). These enzymes are involved in the metabolism of many drugs and are known to have significant pharmacological effects.
Step 3: The aromatic ring structure and the presence of nitrogen atoms indicate potential interactions with ion channels and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). For example, the molecule might interact with calcium channels (CACNA1H) or adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) which are known to have important roles in various physiological processes.
Step 4: Given the complexity and the presence of a nitrogen atom, the molecule may also interact with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4) or cannabinoid receptors (CNR1), which are involved in neurotransmission and pain modulation.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CACNA1H, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CNR1. 
Summary of related genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CACNA1H, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CNR1.
