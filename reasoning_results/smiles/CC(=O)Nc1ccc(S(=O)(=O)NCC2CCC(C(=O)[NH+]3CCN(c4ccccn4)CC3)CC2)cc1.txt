Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)NCC2CCC(C(=O)[NH+]3CCN(c4ccccn4)CC3)CC2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that contains several functional groups such as amide (C(=O)N), sulfonamide (S(=O)(=O)N), aromatic rings (c1ccc(...)), and a benzene ring (C(=O)[NH+]). These functional groups suggest the molecule may have diverse biological activities.
Step 2: Considering the presence of a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), this suggests the molecule might be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes involved in the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics, such as those encoded by CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). This is because sulfonamides are known to interact with various CYP isoforms.
Step 3: The presence of an amide and aromatic ring system could indicate potential interactions with receptors or transporters. For example, the amide group could be involved in binding to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are often targeted by drugs. The GPCRs associated with neurotransmitters include HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, among others. Additionally, the aromatic ring system could interact with transporters like SLC6A2 and SLC6A4, which are involved in the reuptake of monoamines such as serotonin and norepinephrine.
Step 4: The overall structure does not directly suggest strong interactions with kinases (like LCK, MCL1, KDR, or FLT1), transcription factors (like PPARG), or cell surface receptors (like HRH1, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, and DRD2-DRD4).
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4.
Summary of related genes:
- CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4)
