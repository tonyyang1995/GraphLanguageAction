Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C1CC2(CCCC2)CC(=O)[NH+]1CCCC[NH+]1CCN(c2ncccn2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring, a ketone group, and several nitrogen-containing heterocycles. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for similar functional groups, such as enzymes involved in metabolism or receptors that bind neurotransmitters.
Step 2: Given the presence of a ketone group and amide bonds, this molecule could interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). These enzymes are known to metabolize drugs, and the molecule's structure aligns well with substrates for these enzymes.
Step 3: The nitrogen-containing heterocycles, particularly the piperidine and pyrrolidine rings, indicate possible interactions with receptors that bind small molecules, such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are involved in various physiological processes and are targets for many drugs. Genes associated with GPCRs include DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), HTR1A (serotonin receptor 1A), HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A), and HTR2B (serotonin receptor 2B).
Step 4: The presence of a quinoline-like structure in the molecule might suggest interactions with ion channels or transporters. For example, KCNH2 encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel, which could be a potential target given the aromatic and heterocyclic nature of the molecule.
Step 5: Considering the overall complexity and functional groups of the molecule, it is likely to interact with multiple genes involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmitter signaling, and ion channel regulation. Therefore, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and KCNH2.
