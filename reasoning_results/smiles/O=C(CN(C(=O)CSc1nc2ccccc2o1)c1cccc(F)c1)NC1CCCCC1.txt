Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(CN(C(=O)CSc1nc2ccccc2o1)c1cccc(F)c1)NC1CCCCC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound with a benzene ring and a cyano group attached to it. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes that metabolize such compounds, like those encoded by CYP (cytochrome P450) genes.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a ketone group (-CO-) indicates that the molecule could be an inhibitor or substrate for enzymes involved in metabolism, such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are known to metabolize drugs containing similar functional groups.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a quinoline-like structure, which might interact with receptors or transport proteins. This could relate to genes like CYP3A4, which is involved in the metabolism of various xenobiotics and drugs.
Step 4: Given the complexity and potential for interaction with multiple metabolic pathways, there is a chance this molecule could affect neurotransmitter systems. Genes such as HTR2A (serotonin receptor), DRD2 (dopamine receptor), and SLC6A4 (serotonin transporter) are relevant here due to their roles in neurotransmission.
Step 5: Considering the broad range of potential interactions, the most likely related genes are those involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and neurotransmission (HTR2A, DRD2, SLC6A4).
