Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc(Cl)ccc1OCCCC(=O)[NH+]1CC[NH+](C)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a chlorine substituent, a pyrrole ring, and an oxygen atom. This structure is indicative of a potential ligand for receptors that interact with benzene rings and aromatic compounds, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) suggests the molecule could be an agonist or antagonist for ion channels or receptors that bind acidic molecules, such as proton-sensing GPCRs.
Step 3: The amine group (-NH+) indicates the molecule may act as a ligand for receptors that recognize positively charged groups, including certain GPCRs and ion channels.
Step 4: Given the structural features, the molecule might interact with receptors like DRD2 (Dopamine D2 receptor), DRD3 (Dopamine D3 receptor), DRD4 (Dopamine D4 receptor), HTR1A (Serotonin 5-HT1A receptor), HTR2A (Serotonin 5-HT2A receptor), HTR2B (Serotonin 5-HT2B receptor), and HTR2C (Serotonin 5-HT2C receptor), which are known to bind aromatic compounds and positively charged groups.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and potential interactions, the related genes include: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C. 
Summary of related genes: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C.
