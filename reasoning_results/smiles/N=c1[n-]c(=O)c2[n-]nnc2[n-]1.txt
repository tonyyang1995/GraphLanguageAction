Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N=c1[n-]c(=O)c2[n-]nnc2[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is an acyclic compound with multiple nitrogen atoms and a central carbon atom forming a benzene ring. It has a negatively charged nitrogen atom and a carbonyl group, which are characteristic of molecules that interact with receptors or transporters.
Step 2: The presence of a negatively charged nitrogen and a carbonyl group suggests that this molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or transport proteins. These functional groups are often found in compounds that interact with receptors or enzymes, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Step 3: Considering the pattern of the molecule, it might have potential interactions with genes encoding for GPCRs and enzymes involved in drug metabolism. Specifically, it could interact with receptors like adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), and serotonergic receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure may also indicate possible interactions with genes encoding for enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 5: Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. These genes encode proteins that may interact directly or indirectly with the described molecular structure. 
Note: The gene list provided includes only those that potentially match the functional groups and structure described based on the molecule's SMILES string. Not all listed genes necessarily have direct interaction with the molecule; further research would be needed to confirm these interactions.
