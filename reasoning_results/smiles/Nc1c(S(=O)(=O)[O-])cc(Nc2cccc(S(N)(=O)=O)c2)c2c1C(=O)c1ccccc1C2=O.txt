Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Nc1c(S(=O)(=O)[O-])cc(Nc2cccc(S(N)(=O)=O)c2)c2c1C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex molecule that includes a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) and an amide group (-CONH). These functional groups are indicative of potential interactions with enzymes and receptors involved in neurotransmission and metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a sulfonamide group suggests possible interactions with enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize sulfonamides. Additionally, the amide group could interact with receptors like HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are involved in serotonin signaling.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a quinolone-like structure, which is characteristic of drugs that may interact with kinases such as CDK2, LCK, and FLT1. This part of the molecule might also have implications for the gene CYP3A4, which is involved in the metabolism of various xenobiotics and drugs.
Step 4: Furthermore, the presence of aromatic rings and amine groups could indicate potential binding to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4, which are involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release and signaling.
Step 5: Given the above structural features, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes involved in neurotransmission, metabolism, and kinase activity. The related gene names include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CDK2, LCK, and FLT1.
