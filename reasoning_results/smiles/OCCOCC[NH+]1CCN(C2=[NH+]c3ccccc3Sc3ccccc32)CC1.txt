Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: OCCOCC[NH+]1CCN(C2=[NH+]c3ccccc3Sc3ccccc32)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge, indicated by [NH+], which is characteristic of an amine group bearing a positive charge. This functional group can interact with various receptors and ion channels.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a benzene ring system (Sc3ccccc3) connected to a sulfur atom (S), suggesting potential interactions with enzymes or transporters that may contain similar aromatic structures.
Step 3: The presence of multiple nitrogen-containing heterocycles (e.g., N(C2=[NH+]), CN(C2=[NH+])) indicates the molecule could bind to or modulate proteins with similar structural motifs, such as receptors or ion channels.
Step 4: The overall structure suggests potential binding to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to its size and functional groups, which are common targets for drugs affecting neurotransmission.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, KDR, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
