Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(-c2cc(C(=O)OCC(=O)[NH+](C)C3CCS(=O)(=O)C3)c3ccccc3n2)o1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a nitrogen atom (N) that is positively charged, indicating it is an amine with a quaternary ammonium group. This structure is common in ligands for receptors that bind to neurotransmitters or hormones.
Step 2: The molecule also has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) attached to a benzene ring, which is characteristic of compounds that can act as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or other enzymes involved in neurotransmission.
Step 3: The presence of a sulfur-containing heterocycle (thiophene) and a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) suggests the molecule could interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as adrenergic and cholinergic receptors.
Step 4: Given the structure of the molecule, it likely interacts with receptors involved in the nervous system, including adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), cholinergic receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), and dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4).
Step 5: The molecule may also have activity related to GPCR signaling pathways involving serotonin (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) and prostaglandin synthesis (PTGS1).
