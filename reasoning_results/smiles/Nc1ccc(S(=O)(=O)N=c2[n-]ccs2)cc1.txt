Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Nc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)N=c2[n-]ccs2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)N) attached to a benzene ring, which is a common feature in many drugs that interact with receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways. This pattern suggests potential interaction with genes encoding for receptors and enzymes involved in these pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a nitro group (-[n-]) indicates the molecule could be an electrophile or have redox-active properties, which might affect genes involved in oxidative stress response or drug metabolism.
Step 3: The overall structure includes aromatic rings and heteroatoms such as sulfur and nitrogen, which are typical for molecules that can bind to and modulate G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), ion channels, or other protein targets. This structural feature points towards potential interactions with genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode for various types of GPCRs and receptors involved in neurotransmission.
Step 4: Given the presence of a carbonyl group (S(=O)(=O)), this molecule might also interact with enzymes that contain metal-binding sites, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are part of the cytochrome P450 family and are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and functional groups present, the molecule may have the potential to interact with multiple genes involved in neurotransmission, receptor modulation, and drug metabolism, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.
