Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COC(=O)c1cc(Cl)c(NC(=O)c2cc3ccccc3o2)cc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with a carboxamide group (-CONH-) attached to it. This structural feature suggests potential interactions with enzymes or receptors that are involved in drug metabolism or neurotransmission.
Step 2: The presence of a chlorine atom (-Cl) in the molecule indicates possible electrophilic reactivity, which could be relevant for enzyme interactions, particularly those involving CYP (Cytochrome P450) enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 3: The molecule has a nitrogen atom with an amide group, which could interact with various proteins, including receptors and transporters. For instance, this could be relevant to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C.
Step 4: The overall structure includes a benzylamine motif, which might be recognized by enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP3A4.
Step 5: Given the potential interactions with CYP enzymes and GPCRs, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C. Step 5: Summary of related gene names: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C.
