Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc2c(c1)C(=O)[NH+](CCc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)[N-]C(=O)[NH2+]C3CCCCC3)cc1)C(=O)C2(C)C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule, which appears to be a small molecule drug or inhibitor. It contains several functional groups such as amides, esters, and aromatic rings, suggesting it could interact with various proteins.
Step 2: Given the presence of an amide group (-CONH2), this molecule likely targets enzymes that can bind to or modify amides, such as CYP (cytochrome P450) enzymes, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs. Specifically, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are known to metabolize various compounds and could potentially interact with this molecule.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a thioester group (-S=O), which might indicate interactions with enzymes like CYP3A4, which can oxidize thiols and esters, further supporting its potential interaction with CYP family members.
Step 4: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) suggests the molecule may interact with ion channels or receptors that have binding sites for acidic molecules. For example, KCNH2 (a member of the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H) and HTR2A (serotonin receptor) could be potential targets due to their acidic nature and involvement in neurotransmission.
Step 5: Based on the above structural analysis, the related genes include those involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), neurotransmission and receptor function (HTR2A, KCNH2), and possibly signaling pathways influenced by these interactions.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- HTR2A
- KCNH2
These genes are directly or indirectly related to the molecule's potential biological activities and interactions within the body.
