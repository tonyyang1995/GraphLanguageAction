Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCC1(C)Cc2ccccc2-c2[n-]c(=S)[n-]c(=O)c21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with multiple functional groups including a sulfur-containing heterocycle (thiophene), a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (pyrrole), and a ketone group. This structure suggests the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a thiophene ring and a pyrrole ring, along with the ketone functionality, indicates that this molecule might interact with enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. These enzymes are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics, and their inhibition or modulation by this molecule could affect drug efficacy or pharmacokinetics.
Step 3: The nitrogen atoms within the molecule, particularly those involved in heterocycles, suggest potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Specifically, the molecule may target receptors like HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are serotonin receptors, and DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are dopamine receptors.
Step 4: Given the presence of a thiophene ring and the overall structure, the molecule might also interact with ion channels, such as KCNH2, which codes for a voltage-gated potassium channel. This interaction could influence ion channel function, potentially affecting cellular signaling processes.
Step 5: Considering the detailed structure and the presence of functional groups that can form hydrogen bonds and other interactions, this molecule could have a broad range of effects on various genes involved in neurotransmission, metabolism, and cellular signaling. Therefore, the related genes include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, KCNH2.
