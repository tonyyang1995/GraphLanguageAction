Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(-c2oc3cc([O-])cc([O-])c3c(=O)c2[O-])cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule provided is a complex organic compound with a benzene ring (indicated by "c1...cc1"), which contains several functional groups such as hydroxyl (-OH), amide (-CONH2), and ester (-COOR) groups. This structure suggests the molecule could be involved in binding to proteins that interact with these functional groups.
Step 2: Considering the functional groups present, the molecule likely interacts with enzymes and receptors that have hydrophobic binding sites for aromatic rings and polar sites for hydroxyl and amide functionalities. Among the given genes, those encoding enzymes and receptors are relevant.
Step 3: Several genes listed encode receptors or enzymes that might interact with molecules containing these functional groups:
- **Receptors**: ADRB2 (β2-adrenergic receptor), CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4 (muscarinic acetylcholine receptors), HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6 (serotonin receptors).
- **Enzymes**: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 (cytochrome P450 enzymes).
Step 4: These interactions could influence signaling pathways, metabolism, and cellular responses. For instance, CYP enzymes metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics, while G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like those encoded by the CHRM and HTR families mediate responses to neurotransmitters and hormones.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and the presence of functional groups that could bind to specific protein structures, the related genes are: **ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6**. These genes encode proteins that might directly interact with the molecule or be influenced by its effects. 
Summary of related genes: ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
