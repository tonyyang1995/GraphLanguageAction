Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCc1ccc(-c2nc(C[NH+]3CCC(C(=O)NCc4ccccc4OC)CC3)c(C)o2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings and functional groups, including amide, ester, and aromatic rings. This suggests it could interact with various biological targets, including enzymes and receptors.
Step 2: Upon closer inspection, the molecule contains an amide group (-CONH) and an ester group (-COOR), which are common in ligands that bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are proteins that play a role in signaling pathways and are often involved in the regulation of neurotransmission.
Step 3: The presence of an amide group in the molecule is particularly relevant to GPCRs such as HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are serotonin receptors. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter involved in mood regulation and other physiological processes.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's aromatic structure and potential for binding to enzymes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are involved in drug metabolism, suggest a possible interaction with these genes.
Step 5: Based on the molecular features identified, the related genes are HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. These genes are involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism, respectively. 
Summary of Related Genes: HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19.
