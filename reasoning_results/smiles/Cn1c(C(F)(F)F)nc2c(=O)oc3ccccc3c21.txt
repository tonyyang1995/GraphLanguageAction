Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cn1c(C(F)(F)F)nc2c(=O)oc3ccccc3c21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a fluorinated compound with a benzene ring attached to a nitrogen atom, forming a nitrile group (-CN). This structure suggests that it could be an inhibitor of enzymes or receptors that interact with nitrogen-containing compounds or benzene rings.
Step 2: The presence of multiple fluorine atoms (-F) on the benzene ring indicates potential interactions with proteins containing fluoride binding sites or proteins that have hydrophobic pockets, such as membrane proteins or enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: Among the listed genes, those involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) are particularly relevant due to their role in metabolizing xenobiotics, including drugs and other small molecules like the one described. The molecule's fluorinated benzene ring might influence the activity of these enzymes.
Step 4: Additionally, the nitrile group (-CN) in the molecule may interact with receptors or enzymes that recognize or bind to similar functional groups. Genes such as DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), HTR2A (serotonin receptor 5-HT2A), and HRH1 (histamine receptor H1) could be affected by this functional group, as they are known to interact with various ligands.
Step 5: The molecule also has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which could potentially interact with ion channels or receptors that have acidic binding sites. Genes like KCNH2 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2) and SIGMAR1 (sigma-1 receptor) might be influenced by this feature.
Summary of related gene names: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, HRH1, KCNH2, SIGMAR1. These genes are primarily involved in drug metabolism and receptor interactions.
