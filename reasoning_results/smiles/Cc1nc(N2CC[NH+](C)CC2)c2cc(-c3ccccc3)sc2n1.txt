Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1nc(N2CC[NH+](C)CC2)c2cc(-c3ccccc3)sc2n1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule provided is a complex organic compound that contains several functional groups such as amide, ester, and aromatic rings. The presence of these groups suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in signal transduction, neurotransmission, and other biological processes.
Step 2: Notably, the molecule includes an amine group (-NH2) which can form hydrogen bonds and can interact with proteins that have binding sites for small molecules containing basic functionalities. This feature is particularly relevant to receptors and ion channels, which are often targeted by drugs due to their role in signaling pathways and neurotransmission.
Step 3: Among the given genes, those related to neurotransmitter receptors and signaling pathways are likely to be affected by the molecule. For instance, genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 are potential targets due to the presence of the amine group.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule might interact with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, given the presence of functional groups that could be substrates for these enzymes. This interaction could affect drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis and potential interactions, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These genes encode proteins that are directly or indirectly involved in the physiological effects of the molecule. 
Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6.
