Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N#C[NH+]=C(N=c1cc[n-]cc1)NCCCCCCOc1ccc(Cl)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring and a pyridine ring connected via a carbon atom, which is characteristic of certain ligands that can interact with receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2). This structural feature suggests potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (N+) indicates the molecule could act as an agonist for certain receptors, particularly those that respond to acetylcholine (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4) and possibly dopamine (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), as these receptors often have positively charged binding sites.
Step 3: The molecule includes a benzene ring system with multiple substituents, which is a common motif in ligands that bind to enzymes like CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, known for their role in drug metabolism. This suggests the molecule might be metabolized by these enzymes.
Step 4: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an amide group (-CONH2) in the molecule could indicate potential interactions with enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are serotonin receptors.
Step 5: Given the complex structure and the presence of functional groups that could interact with various receptors and enzymes, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes including: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. 
Related Gene Names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
