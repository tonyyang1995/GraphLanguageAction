Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1[n-]c2ccccc2c2ccccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a molecule with a tricyclic core structure, featuring a central benzene ring with a nitrile group (-N#C) attached to it. The molecule also contains two additional benzene rings connected through a series of carbon atoms. This structure suggests that the molecule could be a ligand or inhibitor targeting receptors or enzymes that interact with aromatic hydrocarbons or have specific binding sites for such structures.
Step 2: Given the presence of a nitrile group and the overall aromatic nature of the molecule, it is likely to interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways or those that have specific binding sites for aromatic compounds. This interaction could modulate the activity of these proteins, potentially affecting their function within cellular signaling networks.
Step 3: Among the listed genes, several are known to encode receptors or enzymes that might interact with molecules possessing an aromatic core and a nitrile group. For instance, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, often bind to ligands with specific aromatic patterns. Additionally, CYP enzymes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 are involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics and drugs, many of which have aromatic structures.
Step 4: Furthermore, the presence of a nitrile group could indicate the potential for this molecule to act as a modulator of ion channels or other membrane-bound proteins. For example, KCNH2 encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel, and its modulation could be influenced by molecules with aromatic cores. Similarly, HRH1, which codes for histamine H1 receptor, might also be affected due to its ligand-binding properties.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis and the interactions discussed, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, KCNH2, and HRH1. These genes encode proteins that may directly or indirectly interact with the described molecule due to their specific binding sites or functional roles. 
Summary of related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, KCNH2, HRH1.
