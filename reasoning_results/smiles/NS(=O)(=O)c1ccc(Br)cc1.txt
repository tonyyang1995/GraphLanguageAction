Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(Br)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(Br)cc1 contains a nitrosylated benzene ring with a bromine substituent. This structure suggests potential interaction with enzymes involved in metabolism or signaling pathways.
Step 2: The bromine substituent could indicate involvement in processes regulated by genes related to drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: The presence of a nitro group (NO2) may suggest interactions with genes involved in neurotransmitter systems, particularly those affecting dopamine and serotonin, such as DRD2, HTR2A, and HTR2B.
Step 4: The benzene ring structure might also indicate potential binding to receptors or ion channels, potentially involving genes like CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4, which encode muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.
Step 5: Given the above structural features, the related genes include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4. 
Related Genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4.
