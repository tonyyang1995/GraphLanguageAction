Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [NH3+]CCc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)F)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge, which is part of an amine group. This feature suggests the molecule could interact with receptors that have an affinity for positively charged groups, such as cholinergic receptors.
Step 2: The molecule also has a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) attached to a benzene ring. This moiety might interact with proteins involved in metabolism or detoxification processes, such as those encoded by CYP enzymes (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule includes a fluorine atom attached to a benzene ring, which could potentially interact with proteins that recognize aromatic amino acids or other aromatic compounds, possibly affecting G-protein coupled receptors like HTR2A and HTR2B.
Step 4: The presence of a carbonyl group and a carboxylate group in the molecule indicates it could be an inhibitor or activator of enzymes such as kinases, which are encoded by genes like LCK, CDK2, and MCL1.
Step 5: Given the diverse functional groups and the potential for interaction with multiple targets, the molecule may be related to several genes including ABL1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CACNA1H, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CNR1, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, EGFR, ESR1, FLT1, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, KDR, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, PPARG, PTGS1, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4.
