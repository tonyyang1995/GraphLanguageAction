Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH2+][NH2+]Cc1ccc(C(=O)NC(C)C)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a structure that includes a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (N+), which is part of an amine group (-NH2). This structure suggests the molecule could be an amine-based compound, such as a histamine derivative.
Step 2: The presence of the positively charged nitrogen and the amine group indicates the molecule may interact with receptors that bind to histamine, such as H1, H2, and H3 receptors. These receptors are encoded by genes like HIST1, HIST2, and HIST3, but none of the provided gene names directly correspond to histamine receptors.
Step 3: Among the provided genes, several are associated with neurotransmitter systems, particularly those involving serotonin (5-HT). For instance, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C encode serotonin receptors, which might interact with molecules containing amine groups due to their affinity for various ligands. The presence of the amine group in the molecule makes it plausible that it could interact with these serotonin receptors.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which could suggest its potential to inhibit enzymes involved in the metabolism of neurotransmitters or hormones, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and others listed.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule could potentially interact with genes encoding serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C) and enzymes involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Summary of Related Gene Names:
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
These genes are related to the molecule due to the presence of functional groups that could interact with these receptor types and metabolic enzymes. Other genes listed do not have a clear structural or functional relationship with the given molecule based on the provided information.
