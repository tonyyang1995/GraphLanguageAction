Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc([NH+]2C(=O)NC3CC2(C)Oc2ccccc23)cc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring fused to a benzene ring, with a quaternary ammonium group attached to the benzene ring. This structure is characteristic of many ligands that interact with receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), cholinergic receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), and dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4). These receptors are involved in various physiological processes including neurotransmission.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a carboxamide group (-CONH2) which is often found in ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2), serotonin 2A receptor (HTR2A), and serotonin 2C receptor (HTR2C).
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a benzene ring and a carboxylic acid group suggests potential interactions with enzymes like CYP2D6 and CYP2C9, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics.
Step 4: The overall structure does not strongly suggest direct interaction with genes encoding for transporters (e.g., SLC6A2, SLC6A4) or transcription factors (e.g., PPARG, ESR1).
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is most likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
