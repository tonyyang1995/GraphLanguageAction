Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COC(=O)N=c1[n-]c2ccc(C(=O)c3ccc(F)cc3)cc2[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule in question is a complex organic compound that contains several functional groups including an amide (-CO-N), a nitrile (-CN), and multiple aromatic rings. The presence of these functional groups suggests potential interactions with enzymes or receptors involved in signal transduction or metabolism.
Step 2: The aromatic rings, particularly the one containing fluorine atoms, are characteristic of molecules that could interact with receptors or transport proteins. This structure may allow for binding to proteins involved in neurotransmission or drug transport.
Step 3: Among the listed genes, those involved in neurotransmission or receptor function, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, and SIGMAR1, are likely to be relevant due to their roles in neuronal signaling and receptor interactions.
Step 4: Additionally, genes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, might also be relevant because the molecule’s complex structure could influence its metabolism by these enzymes.
Step 5: The presence of a nitrile group and multiple functional groups could also suggest potential interactions with kinases (e.g., LCK) or other signaling proteins, making genes like PTGS1 and MCL1 potentially relevant.
Summary of related gene names: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, SIGMAR1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, LCK, PTGS1, MCL1.
