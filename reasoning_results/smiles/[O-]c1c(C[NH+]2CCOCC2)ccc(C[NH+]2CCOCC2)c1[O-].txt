Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [O-]c1c(C[NH+]2CCOCC2)ccc(C[NH+]2CCOCC2)c1[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this relationship matters.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring system with two amine groups (-NH2) and two carboxylate groups (-COO-), indicating it is likely an amide or ester derivative.
Step 2: The presence of multiple aromatic rings (benzene rings) connected through carbon chains suggests the molecule has potential to interact with receptors or enzymes that have similar structural motifs.
Step 3: The molecule's structure includes several nitrogen-containing heterocycles, which are common in ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other ion channels.
Step 4: Given the presence of amine groups and the overall structure, the molecule could potentially bind to or modulate the activity of neurotransmitter receptors such as dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) and serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Step 5: The molecule's structure also suggests possible interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
