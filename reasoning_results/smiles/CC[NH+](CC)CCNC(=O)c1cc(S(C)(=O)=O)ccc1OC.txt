Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule contains a quinolone-like structure and a pyrrolidine ring, which are characteristic of several drug classes that interact with receptors and transport proteins.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), which is commonly found in drugs that inhibit enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 3: The presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group suggests potential interaction with ion channels like KCNH2 (hERG potassium channel) and other proteins involved in signal transduction.
Step 4: The molecule has a benzene ring system, which can form hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions with nucleotide binding domains of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as DRD2, HTR1A, and HTR2A.
Step 5: Given the structural features described, the molecule is likely to interact with multiple genes including: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, KCNH2, DRD2, HTR1A, and HTR2A.
