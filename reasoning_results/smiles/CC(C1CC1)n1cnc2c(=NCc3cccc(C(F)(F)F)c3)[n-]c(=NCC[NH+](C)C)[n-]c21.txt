Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C1CC1)n1cnc2c(=NCc3cccc(C(F)(F)F)c3)[n-]c(=NCC[NH+](C)C)[n-]c21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple functional groups such as amine, imine, and fluorinated substituents. It also has a cyclic structure and a nitrogen atom with a positive charge, which are characteristic of certain ligands that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 2: The presence of amino and imino functionalities suggests that the molecule could potentially act as an agonist or antagonist for GPCRs. These functional groups are known to be involved in binding to GPCRs, particularly those that regulate neurotransmitter release or signaling.
Step 3: The cyclic structure with a positively charged nitrogen is reminiscent of certain ligands that bind to adrenergic and cholinergic receptors. For example, adrenergic receptors like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, and ADRB2, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors like CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4, have similar binding sites for ligands.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's fluorinated substituents could affect its pharmacokinetic properties, such as its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, which is important for GPCR ligands targeting brain receptors like HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and potential interactions, the molecule may be related to several genes encoding GPCRs, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C.
