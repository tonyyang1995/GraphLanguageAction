Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(C(=O)n2c(SC)nc3cc4c(cc32)OCCO4)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with a cyano group (-CN), an amide group (-CONH2), and a phenylacetylene moiety. This structural pattern suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group and an amide could indicate the molecule may interact with enzymes such as CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize compounds containing similar functional groups.
Step 3: The phenylacetylene moiety might also suggest interaction with enzymes like CYP3A4, which can oxidize aromatic compounds.
Step 4: Considering the potential metabolic pathways, the molecule could influence genes involved in drug metabolism and response, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.
Step 5: Therefore, the related genes include CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. 
Summary of related genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
