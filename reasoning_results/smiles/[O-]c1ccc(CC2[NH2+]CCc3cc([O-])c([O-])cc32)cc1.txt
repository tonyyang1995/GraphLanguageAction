Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [O-]c1ccc(CC2[NH2+]CCc3cc([O-])c([O-])cc32)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with multiple functional groups, including an amine group (-NH2), carboxylate groups (-COO-), and aromatic rings. The presence of these functional groups suggests that the molecule could interact with proteins that have binding sites for such groups.
Step 2: Notably, the molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge ([NH2+]), which is characteristic of protonated amines. This feature is relevant to the ADRA2B (Adrenergic Receptor Alpha-2B) gene, as it encodes a receptor that binds norepinephrine, a catecholamine neurotransmitter, which has a similar chemical structure to protonated amines.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a quinoline-like ring system, which is reminiscent of CYP2D6 (Cytochrome P450 2D6). CYP2D6 is an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many drugs, and its active site typically accommodates substrates with aromatic and hydroxyl functionalities, similar to those present in the described molecule.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of multiple negatively charged carboxylate groups (-COO-) might be relevant to the HTR2A (Serotonin Receptor 2A) gene, as this receptor can bind to various ligands, including acidic molecules.
Step 5: Based on the structural features of the molecule, the most likely related genes are ADRA2B, CYP2D6, and HTR2A. These genes encode proteins that could potentially interact with the molecule through their respective binding sites.
Summary of related gene names:
- ADRA2B
- CYP2D6
- HTR2A
Note: The other genes listed do not have a direct structural or functional relationship with the given molecule based on the provided information. However, further detailed analysis would be required to confirm potential indirect interactions.
