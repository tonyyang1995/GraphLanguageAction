Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cccc(-c2[n-]c(CNc3ccccc3F)nc2-c2ccc3ncnn3c2)n1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a tricyclic structure with a benzene ring fused to a pyrrole ring and an indole ring. This structure is reminiscent of certain ligands that interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as those involved in neurotransmission.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom within the molecule suggests it could act as a partial agonist or antagonist for GPCRs, which typically contain nitrogen-containing heterocycles in their binding pockets.
Step 3: Notably, the molecule has a fluorine substituent attached to the indole ring, which is often found in compounds that modulate the activity of serotonin receptors, a class of GPCRs.
Step 4: Given the structure and functional groups present, this molecule is likely to interact with GPCRs such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are involved in regulating serotonin signaling.
Step 5: Therefore, the related genes include HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C.
