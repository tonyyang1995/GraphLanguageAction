Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])Cc1c[n-]cn1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string O=C([O-])Cc1c[n-]cn1 consists of a central carbon atom (C) that is double-bonded to an oxygen atom (O), and single-bonded to a nitrogen atom (N). The nitrogen atom is negatively charged, indicated by [n-], and is also bonded to a benzene ring (Cc1c[n-]cn1). This structure suggests the presence of a negatively charged heterocyclic aromatic compound.
Step 2: The presence of a negatively charged nitrogen within a heterocyclic aromatic compound is characteristic of certain drug classes, such as quinolines and isoquinolines, which are known to interact with receptors and ion channels. These interactions often involve the binding to transmembrane proteins and ion channels, which are encoded by specific genes.
Step 3: Considering the structure and charge distribution of the molecule, it is likely to interact with ion channels and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), given their ability to recognize and bind charged groups and aromatic rings. Ion channels are typically associated with genes like KCNH2 (encoding hERG potassium channel) and HTR2A (encoding serotonin receptor 2A), while GPCRs include HTR1A, HTR2B, and HTR2C.
Step 4: The molecule's structure may also suggest potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are part of the cytochrome P450 family and are known to metabolize a wide range of drugs.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and the discussed potential interactions, the related genes are: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, KCNH2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Summary of Related Genes:
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- KCNH2
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6 Step 1: The molecule has a central carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen and single-bonded to a nitrogen with a negative charge, suggesting it might be a heterocyclic aromatic compound.
Step 2: This structure could interact with ion channels or GPCRs due to its charged nitrogen and aromatic nature.
Step 3: Potential interaction with ion channels suggests relevance to KCNH2.
Step 4: Interaction with GPCRs suggests relevance to HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C.
Step 5: Metabolism by enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 is another possible interaction.
- CYP2D6
