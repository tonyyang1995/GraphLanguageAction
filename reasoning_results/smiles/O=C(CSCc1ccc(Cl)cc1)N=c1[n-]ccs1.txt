Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(CSCc1ccc(Cl)cc1)N=c1[n-]ccs1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that includes a benzene ring with a cyano group (-CN), a sulfonylamine group (NS(=O)(=O)N), and a nitroso group (N=O). These functional groups are indicative of potential interactions with enzymes and receptors involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The molecule's structure suggests it could be an inhibitor or modulator of various enzymes due to its functional groups, particularly the cyano and sulfonylamine moieties which are common in drug design for enzyme inhibition. This points towards possible interactions with CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a nitroso group might indicate a potential interaction with receptors such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), given that nitroso compounds can act as ligands for certain types of receptors. This is relevant to genes like DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), HTR1A (Serotonin receptor 1A), and HTR2A (Serotonin receptor 2A).
Step 4: The overall structure does not suggest direct interactions with other specified genes like ABCB1, ABL1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CA12, CA2, CA9, CACNA1H, CDK2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CNR1, CACNA1H, CDK2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CNR1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ESR1, FLT1, HRH1, KDR, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, PPARG, PTGS1, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4, as these genes do not typically have functional groups that would interact with the specific pattern found in this molecule.
Step 5: Based on the analysis, the most likely related genes are CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, and HTR1A, HTR2A. These genes are involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmitter signaling, respectively, which align with the molecular structure described.
