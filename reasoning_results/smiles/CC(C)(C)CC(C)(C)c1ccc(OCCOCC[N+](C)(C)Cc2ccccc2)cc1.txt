Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)(C)CC(C)(C)c1ccc(OCCOCC[N+](C)(C)Cc2ccccc2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains several rings, including benzene and pyrrole rings, which are characteristic of many drug molecules that interact with receptors and transporters. This suggests the molecule could have interactions with genes involved in receptor signaling and drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of an amine group (-NH2) and an ester group (COO-) indicates potential for interaction with proteins such as receptors and enzymes. Amines can form hydrogen bonds, and esters can be substrates for enzymes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are known to metabolize various drugs.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a quinoline ring, which is found in many drugs that act on G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structure is relevant to genes encoding GPCRs such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are associated with dopamine signaling.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a nitro group (-NO2) and a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) suggests the molecule might interact with enzymes involved in phase I metabolism, particularly CYP2D6 and CYP1A2, which are responsible for oxidizing aromatic compounds.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and functional groups, the molecule is likely to interact with multiple genes, but it shows particular relevance to those involved in neurotransmitter signaling (e.g., DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) and drug metabolism (e.g., CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP1A2).
