Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C[N+](C)(C)C)OC(N)=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule with a central carbon atom (CC) that is bonded to a nitrogen atom with a positive charge ([N+]), which is itself bonded to three other carbon atoms (C), and another central carbon atom bonded to an oxygen atom (O) and a hydroxyl group (-OH). This structure suggests the presence of a positively charged amine and a carboxylic acid or ester functionality.
Step 2: The positively charged nitrogen with alkyl groups attached could be involved in binding to receptors or ion channels that have acidic residues or negatively charged regions, such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 3: The carboxylic acid or ester functionality might interact with enzymes that metabolize drugs, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of various substrates including neurotransmitters and hormones.
Step 4: The presence of a positively charged amine could also interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), which is known to bind to various ligands including dopamine, serotonin, and other small molecules.
Step 5: Considering the potential interactions described, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2.
