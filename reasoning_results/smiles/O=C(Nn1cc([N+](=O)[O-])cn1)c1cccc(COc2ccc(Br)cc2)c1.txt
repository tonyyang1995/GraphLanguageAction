Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Nn1cc([N+](=O)[O-])cn1)c1cccc(COc2ccc(Br)cc2)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrimidine ring system, which is characteristic of many drugs that interact with ABL1 (Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1). This interaction is through the tyrosine kinase domain of ABL1.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH-) suggests potential interactions with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as ADRA1D (adrenergic alpha-1D receptor), ADRA2B (adrenergic alpha-2B receptor), ADRB2 (adrenergic beta-2 receptor), CHRM1 (cholinergic muscarinic receptor M1), CHRM3 (cholinergic muscarinic receptor M3), and CHRM4 (cholinergic muscarinic receptor M4).
Step 3: The molecule includes a benzene ring with a halogen atom (bromine), indicating possible interactions with CYP enzymes, particularly CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs containing halogenated aromatic compounds.
Step 4: The presence of an imidazole ring, as seen in the N-nitroso moiety, could suggest potential interactions with HTR2A (serotonin receptor 5-HT2A) and HTR2B (serotonin receptor 5-HT2B), as these receptors often have imidazole-containing ligands.
Step 5: The molecule also contains a quinone moiety, which may interact with PTGS1 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1), a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of prostaglandins.
