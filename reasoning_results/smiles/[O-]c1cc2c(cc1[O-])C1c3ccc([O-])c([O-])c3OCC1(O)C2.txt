Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains several functional groups such as carboxyl (-COOH), hydroxyl (-OH), and ether (O-) functionalities, which are common in small molecules that interact with receptors and enzymes. These functional groups suggest the molecule could have pharmacological activity.
Step 2: The presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups and the overall molecular complexity indicate that this molecule might be a ligand for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This class of receptors is known to be activated by various small molecules, including those with similar structural features.
Step 3: Given the complexity and specific functional groups present, this molecule could potentially interact with several neurotransmitter receptors, such as adrenergic (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and dopaminergic (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) receptors, due to their affinity for molecules with similar structures.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule’s ability to form hydrogen bonds and its hydrophobic regions may allow it to interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize a wide range of drugs.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6.
