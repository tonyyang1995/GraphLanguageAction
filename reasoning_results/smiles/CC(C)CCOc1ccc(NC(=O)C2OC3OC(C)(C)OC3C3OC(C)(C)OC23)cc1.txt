Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C2OC3OC(C)(C)OC3C3OC(C)(C)OC23)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule is a complex organic compound with a structure that includes a benzene ring, a pyrrole ring, and various functional groups such as esters, ethers, and hydroxyl groups. These structural features suggest that the molecule could interact with proteins involved in cellular signaling pathways and metabolic processes.
Step 2: Analyzing the molecular structure further, we observe the presence of an ester group (-COOR) attached to a benzene ring. This type of functional group is often found in ligands that bind to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are known to be involved in various physiological processes including neurotransmission and hormone signaling. The ester group in this molecule could potentially interact with the transmembrane domains of GPCRs, leading to receptor activation or inhibition.
Step 3: Considering the specific GPCR family members listed among the genes, the molecule's structure suggests a potential interaction with HTR2A (serotonin 5-HT2A receptor). Serotonin receptors, especially 5-HT2A, are known to have ester-containing ligands that modulate their activity. Given the presence of an ester group in the molecule, it could be a partial agonist or antagonist of HTR2A, depending on its exact chemical properties.
Step 4: The molecule also contains a pyrrole ring, which could potentially form hydrogen bonds or other interactions with amino acid residues in the active site of enzymes or receptors. However, without more detailed information about the exact binding mode, it's difficult to predict which specific enzymes or receptors might interact with the pyrrole ring. Nonetheless, this structural feature adds to the complexity of the molecule and its potential biological activity.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the most likely related gene from the provided list is HTR2A (serotonin 5-HT2A receptor). Other genes like CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 could also be relevant due to the presence of functional groups that might undergo metabolic transformations, but the direct relationship would depend on the exact chemical nature of the molecule.
Summary of related gene names:
- HTR2A
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
These genes are chosen based on the structural features of the molecule and their known roles in biological processes. The exact relationship would require further experimental validation.
