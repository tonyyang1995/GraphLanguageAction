Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc2cc(CCC(C)=O)ccc2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a benzene ring system with multiple substituents, including an amide group (-CONH-) and a cyclohexene ring. The presence of an amide group suggests potential interactions with proteins that contain amine groups or have catalytic activity involving amide bonds.
Step 2: The molecule contains a quinoline-like structure with a nitrogen atom and a phenyl ring, which is characteristic of many drugs that interact with receptors such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature could indicate potential binding to receptors like DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are known to bind to various ligands, including neurotransmitters.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a benzene ring with a carboxamide group, which can form hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues in protein active sites. This feature might suggest interaction with enzymes that have catalytic sites containing amino acids such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: The cyclohexene ring and the overall size and shape of the molecule could fit into the binding pockets of large protein targets, potentially interacting with receptors or transporters. This might be relevant for genes like ABCB1, which encodes a multidrug resistance protein, or SLC6A4, which codes for a serotonin transporter.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule could be related to several genes, including ABCB1, ABL1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KDR, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, PTGS1, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4.
