Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])c1ccccc1[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples or additional unnecessary text.
Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string O=C([O-])c1ccccc1[O-] is a negatively charged oxetanone derivative, which includes an oxygen atom double-bonded to a carbon atom, with two methyl groups attached to this carbon, and an additional negatively charged oxygen group. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for similar chemical moieties.
Step 2: The molecule's negative charge and polar functional groups could interact with ion channels, particularly those that are sensitive to changes in pH or charged molecules. This aligns with the presence of CACNA1H (a calcium channel protein) and KCNH2 (a potassium channel protein) among the listed genes.
Step 3: The molecule's aromatic ring system might also interact with receptors or enzymes that bind to or metabolize aromatic compounds. This is relevant to genes such as CYP1A2 (cytochrome P450 enzyme), CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 (all involved in drug metabolism).
Step 4: Given the molecule's structure, it may also influence G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to its ability to fit into the hydrophobic pockets of these receptors. This could be relevant to DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4 (dopamine receptors), HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 (serotonin receptors).
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the molecule is potentially related to CACNA1H, KCNH2, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes are involved in various physiological processes including ion channel function, drug metabolism, and neurotransmitter signaling. Step 5: List of related gene names: CACNA1H, KCNH2, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
