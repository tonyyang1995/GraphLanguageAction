Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCN(CC)c1ccc(NC(=O)c2cnn(CC)c2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings and functional groups, including a pyrrolidine ring, a phenyl ring, and amide and nitro functionalities. This structure suggests it could interact with proteins involved in signaling pathways and neurotransmission.
Step 2: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) and an amide (-CONH-) indicates potential for bioelectrochemical activity and could be relevant to ion channels or receptors that modulate electrical signals in neurons, such as those encoded by KCNH2 (a potassium channel subunit).
Step 3: The presence of a pyrrolidine ring and the overall complexity of the molecule suggest it might interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are involved in various signaling pathways and neurotransmission. Specific GPCRs include those encoded by HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are serotonin receptors.
Step 4: The molecule’s ability to interact with ion channels or GPCRs could also influence the activity of enzymes like CYP2D6, which metabolizes many drugs, including those that affect neurotransmitters.
Step 5: Given the molecular features and potential interactions, the most likely related genes are those involved in neurotransmission, ion channel function, and drug metabolism. These include: HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, and CYP2D6.
Summary of Related Genes: HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, CYP2D6.
