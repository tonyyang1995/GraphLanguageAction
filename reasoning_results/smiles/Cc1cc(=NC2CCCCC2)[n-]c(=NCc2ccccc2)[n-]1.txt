Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc(=NC2CCCCC2)[n-]c(=NCc2ccccc2)[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule, which appears to be a tricyclic compound containing nitrogen atoms and aromatic rings. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for similar chemical motifs.
Step 2: Analyzing the chemical structure, the molecule contains multiple nitrogen-containing heterocycles (such as pyrrole and imidazole), which are known to interact with various receptors and enzymes. Specifically, the presence of amine groups (-NH2) and the overall cyclic structure suggest possible binding to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other protein targets.
Step 3: Considering the pattern of nitrogen atoms within the molecule, it could potentially bind to adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4). These receptors are known to have amine-binding sites and are involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways.
Step 4: Given the presence of imidazole and pyrrole rings, the molecule may also interact with enzymes such as CYP2D6, which has a heme-binding site that can accommodate aromatic compounds. Additionally, the molecule's structure could influence the activity of genes involved in drug metabolism and transport, such as ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein).
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the most likely related genes are those associated with neurotransmitter systems and drug metabolism. Therefore, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2D6, and ABCB1.
