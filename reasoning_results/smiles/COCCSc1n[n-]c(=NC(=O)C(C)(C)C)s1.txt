Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule containing a core structure with multiple substituents, including a benzene ring, a pyrrole ring, and various functional groups such as amide, carbonyl, and sulfur-containing functionalities.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and sulfur-containing functionalities suggests that this molecule could potentially interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, which are often modulated by small molecules with similar structural features.
Step 3: Among the listed genes, those involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling and neurotransmitter systems are particularly relevant due to their association with ligand binding and signal transduction processes. These include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 4: The molecule's structure, featuring a pyrrole ring and amide functionality, could be indicative of a potential agonist or antagonist for certain GPCRs, making it relevant to the genes involved in neurotransmission and hormone signaling.
Step 5: Given the potential for interaction with GPCRs, the related genes are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
