Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cccc(C)c1NC(=O)C(C)[NH3+], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a tricyclic core structure with a piperidine ring fused to a phenyl ring, which is characteristic of many GABA receptor antagonists and some opioid receptor agonists. This structural feature suggests that the molecule may interact with receptors that bind GABA or opioids.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH) attached to the nitrogen atom in the piperidine ring is indicative of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, which could suggest interactions with cholinergic systems. This is relevant because several genes listed are involved in cholinergic signaling, such as CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 3: The molecule also has a quaternary ammonium salt group (NH3+) attached to the nitrogen atom in the piperidine ring. This feature is common in NMDA receptor antagonists and may indicate interactions with glutamatergic pathways. Genes like NR2B (encoding the NMDA receptor subunit) are not directly listed, but related genes such as HTR1A and HTR2A (serotonin receptors) might be indirectly involved due to cross-talk between glutamatergic and serotonergic systems.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a cyano group (-CN) and a benzene ring suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. These genes encode cytochrome P450 enzymes that are crucial for the metabolism of various drugs.
Step 5: Given the molecule's structure and its potential to interact with multiple receptor types and metabolic pathways, it is likely to have effects on several of the listed genes, particularly those involved in neurotransmitter systems and drug metabolism.
