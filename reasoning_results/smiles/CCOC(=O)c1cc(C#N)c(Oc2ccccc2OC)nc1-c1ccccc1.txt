Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)c1cc(C#N)c(Oc2ccccc2OC)nc1-c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound with multiple functional groups including an amide (C=O), a ketone (C=O), and aromatic rings. These features suggest that it could interact with enzymes or receptors that are involved in metabolism, signaling, or transport processes.
Step 2: Considering the presence of a ketone group and an amide, this molecule likely has pharmacological activity, potentially acting as an agonist or antagonist for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) or other membrane-bound proteins. GPCRs are known to be regulated by various genes such as DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode for dopamine and serotonin receptors.
Step 3: The aromatic ring structure, particularly the presence of a nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring (likely part of a pyrrole or similar structure), indicates potential interaction with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs). CYP enzymes are encoded by genes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, suggesting the molecule may be metabolized by these enzymes.
Step 4: Given the presence of a ketone and amide, the molecule might also interact with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those encoded by PTGS1 (COX-1/COX-2), which are involved in prostaglandin synthesis. PTGS1 is associated with genes like PTGS1 itself.
Step 5: The overall complexity of the molecule, including its potential interactions with multiple types of enzymes and receptors, suggests a broad pharmacological profile. However, based on the specific chemical features, the most relevant genes appear to be those encoding for GPCRs and CYP enzymes.
Summary of related gene names:
- GPCRs: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- CYP enzymes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6
- PTGS1 (COX-1/COX-2): PTGS1
These genes are directly or indirectly related to the potential functions of the described molecule.
