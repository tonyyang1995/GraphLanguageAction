Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COCC[NH2+]Cc1ccc(-c2cc3nccc(Oc4ccc(NC(=O)C5(C(=O)Nc6ccc(F)cc6)CC5)cc4F)c3s2)nc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that includes a pyrrolidine ring, an amide group, and multiple substituents such as fluorine atoms, nitro groups, and aromatic rings. This structure suggests the molecule could interact with receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmission or metabolism.
Step 2: Given the presence of a pyrrolidine ring and an amide, this molecule might be similar to certain types of ligands that bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or other receptors involved in signaling pathways. For instance, it could potentially interact with adrenergic receptors (e.g., ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), which have pyrrolidine-containing ligands.
Step 3: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH2) and a ketone group (-CO-) suggests the molecule might be an inhibitor or substrate for enzymes like CYP2D6, which metabolizes drugs and xenobiotics, or CYP3A4, another important cytochrome P450 enzyme involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: Considering the complexity and the presence of a benzene ring, the molecule may also interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism or signaling, such as those listed under the CYP family, which includes CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes involved in neurotransmission, receptor function, and drug metabolism, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, and HTR2A.
