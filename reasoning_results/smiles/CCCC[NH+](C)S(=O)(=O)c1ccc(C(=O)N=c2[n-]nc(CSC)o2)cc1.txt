Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCC[NH+](C)S(=O)(=O)c1ccc(C(=O)N=c2[n-]nc(CSC)o2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure that includes a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (NH+), which is part of an amide group (-CONH+). This feature suggests the molecule could interact with receptors that bind to positively charged groups or have a particular affinity for certain functional groups.
Step 2: The molecule also contains a sulfonate group (-SO3-) and a thiocyanate group (-SCN), which are likely to form hydrogen bonds or ionic interactions with polar or charged amino acid residues in proteins. These functional groups might be recognized by receptors such as ion channels, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), or enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 3: Given the presence of aromatic rings and a carboxamide group (-CONH+), the molecule may have potential to interact with enzymes like cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes, which are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics. CYP enzymes, particularly CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, play crucial roles in drug metabolism and could be influenced by this molecule.
Step 4: The molecule’s structure, including the amide and sulfonate groups, suggests it might interact with GPCRs, which are often involved in signaling pathways regulated by neurotransmitters and hormones. GPCRs associated with serotonin (HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C), dopamine (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), and other neurotransmitters could be affected by this molecule.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and functional groups, the molecule could potentially influence the activity of enzymes involved in metabolic pathways, such as those encoded by CYP3A4, which is known to metabolize a wide range of drugs.
