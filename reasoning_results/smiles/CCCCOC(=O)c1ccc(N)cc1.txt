Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a structure that includes a benzene ring (indicated by "c1ccc(N)cc1"), an amide group (indicated by "OC(=O)"), and several other functional groups such as alkyl chains and hydroxyl groups. This structure suggests it could interact with proteins that have binding sites for aromatic compounds, amides, or other specific functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group and a benzene ring indicates potential interactions with enzymes or receptors involved in signal transduction pathways, particularly those that recognize and bind to these structures. 
Step 3: The benzene ring and amide group suggest the molecule might be related to genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which often have binding sites for aromatic compounds and amides, or enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYPs) that metabolize similar molecules.
Step 4: Considering the specific features of the molecule, it may be related to genes encoding CYP enzymes (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) due to the presence of functional groups that are substrates for these enzymes.
Step 5: The molecule also shows potential for interaction with genes involved in neurotransmitter systems, given its structural features, suggesting possible relationships with DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, and other genes related to dopamine and serotonin receptors.
Summary of related gene names: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B.
