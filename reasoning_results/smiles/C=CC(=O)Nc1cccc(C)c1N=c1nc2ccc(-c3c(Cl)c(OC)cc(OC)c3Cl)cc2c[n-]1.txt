Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C=CC(=O)Nc1cccc(C)c1N=c1nc2ccc(-c3c(Cl)c(OC)cc(OC)c3Cl)cc2c[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with a ketone group (C=O), a nitrile group (N#C), and a heterocyclic nitrogen atom. This structure is reminiscent of certain drug molecules that interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 2: The presence of a heterocyclic nitrogen and a nitrile group suggests potential interactions with GPCRs, particularly those involved in neurotransmitter signaling. GPCRs are often targeted by drugs due to their role in various physiological processes, including pain perception, mood regulation, and inflammation.
Step 3: Notably, the molecule's structure may align with known ligands for dopamine receptors, such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are involved in the regulation of mood, reward, and movement. The heterocyclic structure and the presence of a nitrile group could contribute to binding affinity for these receptors.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure might also be relevant to serotonin receptors, such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which play crucial roles in mood, anxiety, and sleep. The aromatic rings and functional groups could facilitate binding to these receptors.
Step 5: Based on the molecular features described, the most likely related genes are DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C.
