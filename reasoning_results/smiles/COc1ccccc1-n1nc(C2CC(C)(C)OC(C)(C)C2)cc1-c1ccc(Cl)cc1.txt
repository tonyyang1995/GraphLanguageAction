Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccccc1-n1nc(C2CC(C)(C)OC(C)(C)C2)cc1-c1ccc(Cl)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a benzene ring system with multiple substituents, including an amino group (-NH2), a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH), and a cyano group (-CN). These functional groups are characteristic of molecules that can interact with receptors or enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group suggests potential for binding to receptors or enzymes that recognize such functional groups. This could include G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) which often have hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions to bind various ligands.
Step 3: The molecule also has a quinoline-like structure with a cyano group, which is known to be involved in interactions with certain drug targets like CYP enzymes, particularly CYP2D6 and CYP2C9, due to their ability to oxidize aromatic rings and the presence of electron-withdrawing groups.
Step 4: Given the complexity and the specific functional groups present, this molecule could potentially interact with several genes encoding receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism. For example, it might interact with genes such as CYP2D6, CYP2C9, HTR2A (serotonin receptor), and DRD2 (dopamine receptor).
Step 5: Based on the analysis of the molecule's structure and its potential interactions, the related genes are: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, HTR2A, and DRD2. These genes encode enzymes and receptors that could be directly influenced by the molecule's structure.
