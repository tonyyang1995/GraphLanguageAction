Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOc1cn(-c2ccc(F)cc2C)nc1C(=O)Nc1ccc(Oc2ccnc3cc(OC)c(OC)cc23)c(F)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with a central benzene ring, which is substituted with various functional groups such as hydroxyl (-OH), amide (C=O), cyano (-CN), and fluoro (-F) groups. This structure is characteristic of drugs that interact with receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: Upon closer inspection, the presence of a cyano group (-CN) and a benzene ring with amide functionality suggests the molecule could be a ligand for receptors or enzymes that bind to similar structural motifs. This is particularly relevant to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The molecule's amide group (C=O) and the presence of a nitrogen atom in its structure indicate potential interactions with enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYP enzymes), which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs. Among the listed genes, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 are known to be involved in the metabolism of various substrates, including those with amide and aromatic functionalities.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a benzene ring and hydroxyl groups could suggest potential interactions with receptors such as adrenergic receptors (e.g., ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and cholinergic receptors (e.g., CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4). These receptors often have binding sites for molecules containing aromatic rings and hydroxyl groups.
Step 5: Considering the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
