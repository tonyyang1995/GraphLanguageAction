Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(N=c1cccn[n-]1)[NH+]1CCC(=Cc2cccc(Oc3ccc(C(F)(F)F)cn3)c2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring system, which is characteristic of many drugs that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This suggests potential interaction with genes encoding for GPCRs.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a phenylalanine ring and a quinoline ring, which are common in molecules that can modulate the activity of enzymes such as CYP2D6 and CYP3A4.
Step 3: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) and a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) indicates potential interactions with enzymes involved in phase I and II metabolism, specifically CYP2C19 and CYP2C9.
Step 4: The overall structure, including the presence of multiple functional groups, suggests the molecule could act as an agonist or antagonist for receptors like DRD2, HTR2A, and HTR2B, which are encoded by the genes DRD2, HTR2A, and HTR2B respectively.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule may be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, OPNK1, and SLC6A4.
