Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(CC[NH+]1CC[NH+](C(=O)OCc2cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c2)CC1)c1ccc2[n-]c(=O)oc2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring system, which is common in many ligands for receptors such as HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A), HTR2B, and HTR2C (serotonin receptor 2B and 2C). These receptors are involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a quinoline-like structure, which is often found in ligands for CYP enzymes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The presence of an imidazole ring, particularly the N-H+ groups, suggests potential interactions with proton pump inhibitors or other drugs that target proton transporters, such as SLC6A4 (sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter 4).
Step 4: The molecule’s overall structure hints at potential binding to ion channels, such as KCNH2 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2), given its aromatic and hydrophobic regions.
Step 5: Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, the molecule could interact with several genes, including those involved in neurotransmission, metabolism, and ion channel function. Specifically, the related genes are HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, KCNH2, and SLC6A4.
