Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+]1CCCCC1CCN1c2ccccc2Sc2ccc([S+](C)O)cc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (N+), which suggests it could be an amine derivative with potential biological activity. This feature may interact with proteins that have binding sites for positively charged amino acids, such as ion channels or receptors.
Step 2: The molecule has multiple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene rings), which are common in many bioactive molecules. These rings can form hydrogen bonds and other interactions with proteins, particularly those involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 3: The presence of sulfur atoms in the molecule, specifically in the sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), indicates potential interaction with proteins containing cysteine residues, which can form disulfide bridges or act as ligand-binding sites.
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule, including its size and shape, might allow it to fit into the active site of enzymes or receptors, potentially affecting their function. For example, the molecule could interact with enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYP enzymes), which are encoded by genes such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
Step 5: Given the structural features identified in the previous steps, the molecule could be related to several genes encoding neurotransmitter receptors and transporters, such as DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), HTR1A (serotonin receptor 5-HT1A), HTR2A (serotonin receptor 5-HT2A), HTR2B (serotonin receptor 5-HT2B), HTR2C (serotonin receptor 5-HT2C), and OPRK1 (opioid receptor kappa 1). It could also interact with genes encoding ion channels, such as KCNH2 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2).
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP1A2
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- DRD2
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- HTR6
- OPRK1
- KCNH2
These genes are involved in various physiological processes, including drug metabolism, neurotransmission, and ion channel regulation. The molecule's structure suggests it could influence these processes through direct interaction with proteins encoded by these genes. However, further experimental validation would be needed to confirm any specific interactions.
