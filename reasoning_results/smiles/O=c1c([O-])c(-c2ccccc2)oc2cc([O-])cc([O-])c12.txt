Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1c([O-])c(-c2ccccc2)oc2cc([O-])cc([O-])c12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring, an oxygen atom double-bonded to a carbon, and multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes that metabolize drugs or hormones.
Step 2: The presence of hydroxyl groups indicates the molecule could be recognized by receptors that bind to or are influenced by such functional groups, like G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: Given the complexity and the potential for metabolic activity, the molecule might interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 4: Considering the possible receptor binding, the molecule could also influence neurotransmitter receptors, potentially interacting with HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, and DRD3.
Step 5: Summarized related gene names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3. ```plaintext
