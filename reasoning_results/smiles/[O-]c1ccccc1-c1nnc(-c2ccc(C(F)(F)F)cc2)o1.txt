Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [O-]c1ccccc1-c1nnc(-c2ccc(C(F)(F)F)cc2)o1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that contains several functional groups such as an amine (-NH2), an aromatic ring system, and a negatively charged oxygen atom (O-). This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in neurotransmission, signal transduction, or metabolic pathways.
Step 2: Analyzing the structure for potential pharmacophoric features, the presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (possibly part of an amine group) and aromatic rings could indicate the molecule has affinity for receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmitter signaling or metabolism.
Step 3: Considering the gene list provided, several genes encode proteins involved in neurotransmitter systems and receptor functions. For instance, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, and CHRM1 encode dopamine receptors, serotonin receptors, and cholinergic receptors, respectively. These receptors interact with various ligands including neurotransmitters and small molecules like the one described.
Step 4: The presence of fluorinated substituents (F) in the molecule may suggest it could interact with enzymes or receptors that are sensitive to steric or electronic properties, such as CYP2C19, which metabolizes drugs and xenobiotics, or HTR2A, which responds to changes in electron density around its binding site.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and the genes' known functions, the molecule could be related to the following genes: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, CHRM1, CYP2C19, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- CHRM1
- CYP2C19
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- HTR6
- LCK
- MCL1
- OPRK1
- SLC6A2
- SLC6A4 Step 5: Summary of related gene names:
- SLC6A4
These genes are involved in neurotransmitter signaling and receptor functions, making them potentially relevant to the molecule's biological activity. The specific relationships would need further experimental validation.
