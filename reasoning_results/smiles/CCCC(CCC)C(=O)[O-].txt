Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCC(CCC)C(=O)[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string CCCC(CCC)C(=O)[O-] is a negatively charged compound with a central carbon atom bonded to four methyl groups and a carboxylate group. This structure suggests it could be a derivative of tetramethylbenzoic acid.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylate group (-COO-) indicates that this molecule could act as a ligand or substrate for enzymes involved in carboxylation reactions, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: The molecule's overall structure does not directly indicate a strong relationship with neurotransmitter receptors, ion channels, or other proteins listed in the genes. However, its potential to interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism might influence pathways related to neurotransmission or signal transduction.
Step 4: Given the indirect nature of the interaction, the most relevant gene in this context would be those involved in drug metabolism and detoxification processes. These include CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6. 
Summary of related genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6.
