Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N#Cc1ccc2[nH]cc(CCCC[NH+]3CCN(c4ccc5oc(C(N)=O)cc5c4)CC3)c2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that contains a nitrogen-nitrogen double bond (N#N), aromatic rings (indicated by 'c' in the SMILES notation), a substituted indole ring, and multiple heteroatoms such as nitrogen and oxygen. This structure suggests the molecule could be a ligand or inhibitor for enzymes or receptors that interact with these functional groups.
Step 2: Analyzing the structure for potential interactions with genes, we focus on enzymes and receptors that might bind to or metabolize similar functional groups. For instance, the presence of a nitrogen-nitrogen double bond and a substituted indole ring could indicate a potential interaction with CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are involved in the metabolism of various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring and a hydroxyl group (-OH) suggests possible interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Genes encoding these receptors include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and SIGMAR1. These receptors typically bind small molecules like neurotransmitters and hormones, which can have structural similarities to the described molecule.
Step 4: Considering the presence of an amide group (-NHCO-) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), the molecule may also interact with ion channels and transporters. Genes encoding these include KCNH2, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4. Ion channels and transporters often have binding sites for small molecules that modulate their activity.
Step 5: Based on the structural features of the molecule, the related genes are likely to be those encoding enzymes involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and GPCRs (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, SIGMAR1) as well as ion channels and transporters (KCNH2, SLC6A2, SLC6A4).
