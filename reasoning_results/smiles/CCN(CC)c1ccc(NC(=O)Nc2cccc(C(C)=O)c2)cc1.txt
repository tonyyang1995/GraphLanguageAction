Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCN(CC)c1ccc(NC(=O)Nc2cccc(C(C)=O)c2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex molecule with multiple functional groups, including amides, aromatic rings, and a nitrogen atom in the central part of the structure. This molecule likely interacts with proteins that have binding sites for such functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-CONH-) and a nitrogen atom suggests potential interactions with enzymes or receptors that have catalytic or binding sites involving these functionalities. For instance, enzymes like CYP2D6, which metabolizes various drugs and xenobiotics, often contain functional groups that interact with amides and nitrogen-containing compounds.
Step 3: The aromatic ring structure could indicate a potential interaction with receptors that bind to aromatic ligands, such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) or G-protein coupled receptors (e.g., HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B).
Step 4: Given the complexity and the presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocycle, this molecule might also interact with proteins involved in neurotransmission or receptor signaling, such as HTR2C, DRD2, or HRH1.
Step 5: Considering the potential interactions described, the related genes are likely to be those involved in drug metabolism (CYP2D6), neurotransmission (HTR2C, DRD2, HRH1), and receptor signaling (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2).
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2D6
- HTR2C
- DRD2
- HRH1
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- ADRB2 To provide more context, these genes are involved in processes such as drug metabolism, neurotransmitter signaling, and receptor function, which aligns with the structural features of the given molecule. The interactions would likely involve the amide group and the nitrogen-containing heterocycle of the molecule with the respective binding sites of these genes' encoded proteins. However, without experimental data, it is important to note that these relationships are inferred based on structural similarities. Step 1: The provided SMILES string indicates a complex organic molecule containing several functional groups such as amides, aromatic rings, and a nitrogen atom.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-CONH-) suggests potential interactions with enzymes like CYP2D6, which metabolizes various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: The aromatic ring structure may indicate binding to receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) or G-protein coupled receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B).
Step 4: The nitrogen-containing heterocycle could suggest interactions with neurotransmitter receptors like HTR2C, DRD2, and HRH1.
Step 5: Based on these structural features, the related genes are CYP2D6, HTR2C, DRD2, HRH1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, and HTR2B. These genes encode proteins involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmission, and receptor signaling. Summary of related gene names:
