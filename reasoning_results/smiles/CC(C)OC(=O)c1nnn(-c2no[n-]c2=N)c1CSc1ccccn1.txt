Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)OC(=O)c1nnn(-c2no[n-]c2=N)c1CSc1ccccn1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is characteristic of many drug molecules that interact with receptors or enzymes. This structural feature may suggest potential interactions with genes encoding for proteins involved in signal transduction pathways or drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-CO-NH-) indicates the molecule could be an inhibitor or activator of enzymes such as those encoded by CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs.
Step 3: The molecule also has a nitrile group (-CN), which might interact with proteins involved in signaling pathways, potentially affecting genes like HRH1 or HTR2A, which encode receptors involved in neurotransmission.
Step 4: The overall structure includes aromatic rings and heteroatoms, suggesting possible binding to ion channels or receptors. This could relate to genes like KCNH2, which encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel, or genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors such as CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 5: The presence of a nitrophenyl group and a quinoline-like structure might indicate interaction with enzymes or receptors involved in cellular signaling pathways, possibly linking to genes like PTGS1 (encoding COX-2, an enzyme involved in inflammation).
Summary of related gene names: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, HRH1, HTR2A, KCNH2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, PTGS1.
