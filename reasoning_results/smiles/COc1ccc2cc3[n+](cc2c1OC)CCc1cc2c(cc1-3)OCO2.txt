Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc2cc3[n+](cc2c1OC)CCc1cc2c(cc1-3)OCO2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is common in many drugs that interact with receptors and enzymes. This structure could potentially bind to proteins involved in signaling pathways or metabolism.
Step 2: The molecule includes a pyridine ring and a quinoline ring, which are known to be involved in binding to various receptors and enzymes, particularly those associated with neurotransmission and drug metabolism.
Step 3: The presence of an amide group and an ether linkage suggests potential interactions with proteins that have catalytic or structural roles, such as enzymes or receptors.
Step 4: The overall complexity of the molecule, including multiple functional groups, indicates it may have a broad range of potential interactions with different types of proteins, including those encoded by the listed genes.
Step 5: Given the molecular structure and its potential for interacting with diverse proteins, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism, such as CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, and SLC6A4.
Summary of related genes: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, SLC6A4. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is common in many drugs that interact with receptors and enzymes. This structure could potentially bind to proteins involved in signaling pathways or metabolism.
