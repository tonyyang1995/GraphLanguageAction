Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])CCSc1cc(NS(=O)(=O)c2ccc3ccccc3c2)c2ccccc2c1[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a quinolone-like structure (O=C([O-])CC) and a benzene ring system (NS(=O)(=O)c2ccc3ccccc3c2), which are common in drugs that interact with the cytochrome P450 enzyme family, specifically CYP2C19 and CYP2C9. These enzymes are involved in the metabolism of many drugs, including those that affect neurotransmitters.
Step 2: The presence of a quinoline core and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) suggests the molecule might act as an agonist or antagonist for receptors such as HTR2A (serotonin receptor), which is known to be influenced by molecules containing these functional groups.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a thiazole ring (c1cc(NS(=O)(=O)c2ccc3ccccc3c2)c2ccccc2c1), which is often found in compounds that interact with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4). This structural feature could indicate potential interactions with these receptors.
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule, particularly the presence of multiple functional groups (carboxylate, amide, and thiazole) and its aromatic nature, suggests it could potentially interact with ion channels and transporters. For instance, it may influence KCNH2 (hERG potassium channel) or SLC6A4 (norepinephrine transporter).
Step 5: Given the molecule’s structure and potential interactions, the related genes include CYP2C19, CYP2C9, HTR2A, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, KCNH2, and SLC6A4.
Summary of related genes: CYP2C19, CYP2C9, HTR2A, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, KCNH2, SLC6A4.
