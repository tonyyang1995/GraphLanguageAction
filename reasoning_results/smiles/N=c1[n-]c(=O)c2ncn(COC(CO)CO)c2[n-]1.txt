Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N=c1[n-]c(=O)c2ncn(COC(CO)CO)c2[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom double-bonded to a carbon atom, which is part of a pyrrole ring, and another nitrogen atom with a negative charge. This structure suggests the molecule could interact with ion channels or receptors that contain similar functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and a phenolic hydroxyl group (C-OH) indicates potential for binding to enzymes involved in metabolism or signaling pathways, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 3: The aromatic ring system with multiple substituents, including an amide group (N-C=O), points towards possible interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or other membrane proteins, potentially relevant to DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C.
Step 4: The overall structure, with its polar functional groups and potential for hydrogen bonding, could influence the activity of transporters like SLC6A2 and SLC6A4.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure, the molecule may be related to genes encoding GPCRs (DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C), enzymes involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6), and transporters (SLC6A2, SLC6A4).
Summary of related gene names: DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
