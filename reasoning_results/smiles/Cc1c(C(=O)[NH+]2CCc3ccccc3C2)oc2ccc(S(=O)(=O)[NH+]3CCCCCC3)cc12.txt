Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1c(C(=O)[NH+]2CCc3ccccc3C2)oc2ccc(S(=O)(=O)[NH+]3CCCCCC3)cc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a cyano group (-CN), a phenyl ring, and a thiazole ring. It also has an amide group (-CONH2) and an acetyl group (-COCH3). These structural features suggest that the molecule may interact with proteins involved in signaling pathways and metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group and a thiazole ring indicates potential interactions with enzymes such as CYP (Cytochrome P450) enzymes, which are involved in drug metabolism. Specifically, the CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 genes code for enzymes that could metabolize this molecule.
Step 3: The molecule's structure includes a quaternary ammonium salt (-N+), which suggests it might act as an agonist or antagonist at receptors. Receptors like HTR2A (Serotonin receptor 2A) and DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2) have been implicated in various neurological functions and are known to bind to similar structures.
Step 4: The presence of a sulfonate group (-SO3-) and a thiol group (-SH) in the molecule could indicate interactions with proteins that contain cysteine residues, such as the ligand-gated ion channels encoded by genes like CHRM1 (Cholinergic receptor, muscarinic, M1).
Step 5: Given the molecule's diverse functional groups and potential to interact with multiple targets, it is likely to be related to several genes involved in neurotransmission, metabolism, and receptor signaling, including CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, HTR2A, DRD2, CHRM1, and others listed above.
Summary of Related Genes:
- CYP2D6
- CYP2C19
- CYP3A4
- HTR2A
- DRD2
- CHRM1
- ESR1 (Estrogen receptor alpha)
- PTGS1 (Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1) To further narrow down the potential interactions, additional testing or computational analysis would be necessary. However, based on the structural features of the molecule, these genes are the most plausible candidates for interaction.
