Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Nc1c(Br)cc(S(N)(=O)=O)cc1Br, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a bromine substituent (Br) and a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), which is part of a larger aromatic structure. This pattern suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in drug metabolism and transport.
Step 2: The presence of a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) is characteristic of drugs that can interact with enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known for their role in the metabolism of various substrates, including many drugs.
Step 3: The aromatic structure and the bromine atom could potentially influence the binding affinity of the molecule to certain receptors, particularly those that interact with ligands that have similar structural features. This might include G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like DRD2, DRD3, and HTR2A, which are involved in neurotransmission.
Step 4: The molecule's overall structure does not directly suggest strong binding to other genes listed, such as those encoding for kinases (e.g., LCK, CDK2) or enzymes involved in lipid metabolism (e.g., PTGS1).
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is most likely to be related to genes involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmission. Therefore, the related genes are: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, and HTR2A.
