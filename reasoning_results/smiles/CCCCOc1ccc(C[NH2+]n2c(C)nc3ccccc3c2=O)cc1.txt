Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCOc1ccc(C[NH2+]n2c(C)nc3ccccc3c2=O)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure including multiple rings and functional groups such as amide (-CONH2), ether (O), and aromatic rings. The presence of an amide group suggests potential interactions with proteins that have similar functional groups, particularly enzymes or receptors.
Step 2: The aromatic rings, especially the benzene ring, indicate a potential for binding to proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, which could include G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are known to interact with various ligands and modulators.
Step 3: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the amide group and the amino group (-NH2) implies possible interactions with proteins containing similar functional groups, such as enzymes or receptors. This could be relevant to genes encoding proteins with enzymatic activity or receptor function.
Step 4: Considering the structure, the molecule might interact with proteins involved in neurotransmitter signaling, given the presence of amino and amide groups. This could relate to genes encoding receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmitter synthesis, metabolism, or degradation.
Step 5: Based on the structural features, the molecule may be related to genes encoding proteins such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and CNR1, as these genes encode receptors for serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, and cannabinoid receptors, respectively.
