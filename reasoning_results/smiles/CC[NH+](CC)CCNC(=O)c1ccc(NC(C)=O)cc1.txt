Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC[NH+](CC)CCNC(=O)c1ccc(NC(C)=O)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule provided has a complex structure containing a pyrrolidine ring, a piperidine ring, and multiple aromatic rings, which are common in drug molecules designed to interact with various receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of an amide group (N-C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (C=O) suggests that this molecule could act as a ligand or inhibitor for enzymes involved in metabolism or signaling pathways. This structural feature is relevant to enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are part of the cytochrome P450 family responsible for metabolizing many drugs.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a quinolone-like structure, which is characteristic of compounds that can interact with ion channels or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structure is relevant to genes encoding GPCRs like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a benzene ring with a nitro group (-NO2) and a nitrile group (C#N) indicates potential activity against enzymes such as CYP1A2, which can be influenced by compounds with similar chemical moieties. This is particularly relevant to genes involved in drug metabolism and detoxification processes.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related genes to this molecule are likely to be those involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), neurotransmission (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), and ion channel function (CACNA1H, KCNH2).
