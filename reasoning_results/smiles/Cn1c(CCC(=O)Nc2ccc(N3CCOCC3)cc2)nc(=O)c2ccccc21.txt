Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cn1c(CCC(=O)Nc2ccc(N3CCOCC3)cc2)nc(=O)c2ccccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional analysis.
Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings and functional groups, including an amide group (-CONH-) and a benzene ring system. These features suggest potential interactions with proteins that have similar structural elements or functional sites.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of an amide group could indicate the molecule might interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize various drugs through oxidation reactions involving amide bonds.
Step 3: Additionally, the benzene ring system in the molecule might interact with receptors or transporters that have hydrophobic binding sites, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, and CHRM1, which are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) with aromatic residues in their binding pockets.
Step 4: Furthermore, the molecule's overall structure may also suggest potential interactions with enzymes or receptors that modulate neurotransmitter levels, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are serotonin receptors, or PTGS1, which encodes cyclooxygenase-1, an enzyme involved in prostaglandin synthesis.
Step 5: Given the structural features of the molecule, it is likely to be related to several genes involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmission, including CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and PTGS1.
