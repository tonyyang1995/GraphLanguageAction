Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Nc1ccc(N(c2ccccc2)c2ccc(N)cc2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this is relevant.
Step 1: The molecule contains multiple nitrogen atoms and aromatic rings, which are characteristic of molecules that can interact with receptors or transporters located on cell membranes. This suggests potential interactions with genes encoding membrane proteins.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the center of the molecule (Nc1) and the presence of multiple benzene rings suggest possible interaction with genes involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which encode for various types of adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors.
Step 3: The molecule also has a complex structure with multiple substituents, indicating it could be a ligand for enzymes or other proteins involved in signal transduction pathways. This may relate to genes like CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4, which encode for cytochrome P450 enzymes that metabolize drugs and other xenobiotics.
Step 4: Given the presence of a nitrogen atom and the overall structure, there is a possibility that the molecule could interact with ion channels, such as KCNH2, which encodes for the hERG potassium channel.
Step 5: The molecule does not have a direct structural similarity to known ligands for the listed genes EGFR, ESR1, FLT1, HRH1, KDR, LCK, MCL1, OPKR1, PPARG, PTGS1, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, CA12, CA2, CA9, CACNA1H, CDK2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CNR1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, HTR1A, HTR2C, HTR6, and KDR, suggesting no direct interaction with these genes.
