Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)CCS(=O)(=O)c2ccc(Br)cc2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure including a benzene ring system, an amide group, a thioester, and a bromine atom. The presence of an amide and thioester suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism and signaling pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and functional groups such as the amide and thioester could suggest interactions with receptors that have similar chemical structures, like adrenergic and cholinergic receptors. These receptors are known to be involved in various physiological processes, including neurotransmission and muscle contraction.
Step 3: Among the given genes, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4 encode for adrenergic and cholinergic receptors, which are likely to interact with the molecule due to their structural similarities and roles in neurotransmission.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's thioester group might interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are involved in the biotransformation of drugs and other xenobiotics.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and potential interactions, the related genes are ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. 
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
