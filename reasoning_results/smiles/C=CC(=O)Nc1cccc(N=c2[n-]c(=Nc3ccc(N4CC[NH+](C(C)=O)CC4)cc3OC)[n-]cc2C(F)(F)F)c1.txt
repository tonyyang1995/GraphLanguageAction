Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C=CC(=O)Nc1cccc(N=c2[n-]c(=Nc3ccc(N4CC[NH+](C(C)=O)CC4)cc3OC)[n-]cc2C(F)(F)F)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a cyano group (-CN), an amide group (-CONH2), and a nitrile group (-CN). This structure suggests that the molecule could be an inhibitor of enzymes involved in the metabolism of drugs and other molecules.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrile group (-CN) and an amide group (-CONH2) in the molecule indicates potential interactions with enzymes such as CYP2D6 and CYP2C9, which are involved in the metabolism of various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a pyrrolidine ring, which might interact with receptors like HTR2A (serotonin 5-HT2A receptor) and HTR2B (serotonin 5-HT2B receptor), as these receptors often bind to molecules with similar structural features.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of fluorine atoms (-F) in the molecule, particularly in the trifluoromethyl groups, could lead to interactions with proteins such as PPARγ (PPARG), which plays a role in lipid metabolism and inflammation.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and potential interactions described, the molecule is likely related to the following genes: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, HTR2A, HTR2B, and PPARG.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2D6
- CYP2C9
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
