Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1c(N2CC[NH2+]C(C)C2)c(F)cc2c(=O)c(C(=O)[O-])cn(C3CC3)c12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with multiple functional groups including a phenol (O), a pyrrolidine (N), an amide (C(=O)[O-]), a carboxylic acid (c(=O)c(C(=O)[O-])c1), and various heteroatoms such as nitrogen and fluorine. This structure suggests the molecule could interact with proteins that have binding sites for these functional groups.
Step 2: Considering the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a phenolic hydroxyl group (O), this molecule may be able to act as an agonist or antagonist at G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) which often have binding pockets for acidic and aromatic residues. This is particularly relevant for genes encoding GPCRs like DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, all of which are involved in neurotransmission and can be modulated by small molecules.
Step 3: The presence of an amide group (C(=O)[O-]) suggests potential interactions with enzymes or transporters that have active sites containing amide bonds. Genes such as CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and CYP1A2, which encode cytochrome P450 enzymes, might be influenced by this molecule due to its ability to serve as a substrate or inhibitor.
Step 4: Given the overall complexity and the presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (pyrrolidine), this molecule could also interact with ion channels or transporters. Genes such as KCNH2, which encodes a potassium channel, might be affected by this molecule.
Step 5: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a carboxamide group (C(=O)[O-]) indicates the possibility of interaction with enzymes that catalyze reactions involving carboxylic acids or amides. Genes such as PTGS1, which encodes cyclooxygenase-1, could be modulated by this molecule, affecting prostaglandin synthesis.
