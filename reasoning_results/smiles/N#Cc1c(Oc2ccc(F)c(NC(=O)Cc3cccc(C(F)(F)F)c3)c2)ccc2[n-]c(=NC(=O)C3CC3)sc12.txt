Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N#Cc1c(Oc2ccc(F)c(NC(=O)Cc3cccc(C(F)(F)F)c3)c2)ccc2[n-]c(=NC(=O)C3CC3)sc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a tricyclic core structure with a nitrogen atom bearing a double bond (N#C), which suggests it may interact with receptors that have similar binding sites. This pattern is relevant to genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a quinoline-like moiety, which is characteristic of compounds that can modulate cytochrome P450 enzymes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These enzymes are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The presence of a benzene ring with functional groups such as an amide (NC(=O)) and a carboxylic acid (C(=O)OC) suggests potential interactions with enzymes that have active sites containing acidic or basic residues. This is relevant to genes like CYP3A4, which encodes an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many drugs.
Step 4: The molecule’s overall structure and functional groups indicate it could potentially inhibit or activate ion channels, which is relevant to genes like KCNH2, which encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel.
Step 5: The complex structure with multiple functional groups and rings may also interact with nuclear receptors, such as PPARG and SIGMAR1, which are involved in various cellular processes including inflammation and cell proliferation.
Summary of related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, KCNH2, PPARG, SIGMAR1.
