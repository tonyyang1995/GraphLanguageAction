Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains multiple functional groups such as amide, ester, and aromatic rings. These structural features suggest potential interactions with enzymes and receptors involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-CONH-) and an ester group (-COOR-) indicates possible binding to enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism and could affect the molecule's pharmacokinetics.
Step 3: The aromatic rings, particularly the benzene rings, may interact with proteins such as ABL1 and HRH1, which have binding sites for ligands containing aromatic moieties.
Step 4: The molecule's overall structure suggests it might bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as DRD2, HTR2A, and HTR2B, given the presence of nitrogen-containing heterocycles and amine functionalities.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and potential interactions, the related genes include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, ABL1, HRH1, DRD2, HTR2A, and HTR2B. 
Related Genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, ABL1, HRH1, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B. Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and potential interactions, the related genes include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, ABL1, HRH1, DRD2, HTR2A, and HTR2B. 
Related Genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, ABL1, HRH1, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B.
