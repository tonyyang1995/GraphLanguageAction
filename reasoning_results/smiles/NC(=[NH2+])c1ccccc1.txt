Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NC(=[NH2+])c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule, NC(=[NH2+])c1ccccc1, represents an imidazole derivative with a positively charged nitrogen atom. This pattern suggests the molecule could interact with ion channels or receptors that have specific binding sites for positively charged molecules.
Step 2: The positively charged nitrogen in the molecule might allow it to interact with cationic transporters or receptors, which are proteins involved in the regulation of intracellular ion concentrations. Such interactions could influence the function of these proteins.
Step 3: Among the provided genes, those encoding cationic transporters or receptors that could potentially interact with the positively charged nitrogen include CACNA1H (calcium channel subunit alpha 1H), KCNH2 (potassium channel subfamily H member 2), and SLC6A4 (solute carrier family 6 member 4, also known as the serotonin transporter).
Step 4: Additionally, the imidazole ring structure of the molecule may also interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This class of receptors includes several genes listed, such as ADRA1D (adrenergic receptor alpha-1D), ADRA2B (adrenergic receptor alpha-2B), ABL1 (abelson proto-oncogene 1), and HRH1 (histamine H1 receptor).
Step 5: Based on the structure and charge of the molecule, the related genes are: CACNA1H, KCNH2, SLC6A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, and HRH1.
Summary of related gene names: CACNA1H, KCNH2, SLC6A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, HRH1.
