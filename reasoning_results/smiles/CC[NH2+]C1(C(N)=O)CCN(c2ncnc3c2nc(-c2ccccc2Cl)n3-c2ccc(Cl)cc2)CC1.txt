Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC[NH2+]C1(C(N)=O)CCN(c2ncnc3c2nc(-c2ccccc2Cl)n3-c2ccc(Cl)cc2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has an amide group (-NH2) attached to the nitrogen atom of an amine group, which indicates it may be an acetylcholine-like compound. This structural feature is relevant to cholinergic receptors such as CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 2: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is common in many drugs that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural element is pertinent to the GPCRs DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are dopamine receptors.
Step 3: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH2) suggests the molecule could act as an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes like CYP2D6, which is involved in the metabolism of many drugs including those that affect neurotransmission.
Step 4: The complex ring structure, particularly the heterocyclic rings and aromatic moieties, is indicative of molecules that might interact with nuclear receptors such as PPARG, which plays a role in metabolic processes and inflammation.
Step 5: The molecule’s overall structure and functional groups point towards its potential interaction with enzymes and receptors involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are serotonin receptors.
