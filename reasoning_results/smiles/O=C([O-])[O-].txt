Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string O=C([O-])[O-] corresponds to the chemical compound 2-hydroxyoxazole-4-carboxylic acid, which is a negatively charged form of oxazolidinone. This structure does not directly correspond to any known pharmacophore or functional group that would be specifically associated with the listed genes. However, the negative charge indicates it could interact with anions or negatively charged sites.
Step 2: The pattern of having a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an oxazole ring (a five-membered ring with two carbons and three oxygens) is not unique to any of the listed genes. However, the presence of a carboxylic acid might suggest potential interactions with proteins that have acidic residues or binding sites for such groups.
Step 3: The oxazole ring itself does not directly correspond to any of the listed genes' known structures or functions. However, the presence of an oxazole ring is common in many drugs that target G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly those involved in neurotransmission. For instance, some ligands for HTR2A (serotonin receptor) contain oxazole rings.
Step 4: Given the negative charge and the potential for interaction with anions, the molecule could potentially bind to proteins that are negatively charged or have specific anion-binding sites, such as certain ion channels or transporters. Genes like SLC6A2 (solute carrier family 6 member 2, also known as dopamine transporter) and SLC6A4 (solute carrier family 6 member 4, also known as serotonin transporter) encode proteins that are known to have anionic binding sites.
Step 5: Based on the analysis, the most likely related genes from the provided list are SLC6A2 and SLC6A4, as they encode transporters that may interact with negatively charged molecules like the described compound. Other genes like HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which encode serotonin receptors, also come into consideration due to their involvement in neurotransmission, but the direct interaction is less certain without additional context.
Summary of related gene names:
- SLC6A2
- SLC6A4
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
Note: The relationships here are speculative and based on the chemical structure and potential interactions. Further research would be needed to confirm any actual biological interactions.
