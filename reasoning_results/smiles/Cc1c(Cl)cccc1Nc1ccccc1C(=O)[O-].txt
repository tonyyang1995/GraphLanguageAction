Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1c(Cl)cccc1Nc1ccccc1C(=O)[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with multiple substituents including a chlorine atom, a nitrogen atom, and an amide group. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in neurotransmission and receptor binding.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group and a nitrogen atom indicates the molecule could interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are encoded by genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These receptors are involved in various signaling pathways and neurotransmitter systems.
Step 3: The benzene ring and its substituents also suggest possible interactions with enzymes, particularly those involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These genes encode cytochrome P450 enzymes that play crucial roles in the metabolism of many drugs.
Step 4: The molecule’s structure may also influence its interaction with ion channels, indicated by the presence of a benzene ring, which could relate to genes like KCNH2, involved in cardiac ion channel function.
Step 5: Considering the potential for the molecule to interact with various receptors and enzymes, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, KCNH2. Step 5: The related gene names are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, KCNH2.
