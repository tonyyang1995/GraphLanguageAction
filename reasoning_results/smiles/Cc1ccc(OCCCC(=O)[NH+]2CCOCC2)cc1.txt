Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(OCCCC(=O)[NH+]2CCOCC2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains an aromatic ring system with a central benzene ring and several substituents, including a hydroxyl group and a carboxamide group. This structural pattern suggests potential interactions with enzymes and receptors that are involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group indicates possible binding to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are often associated with neurotransmitter signaling. This could relate to genes encoding GPCRs such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are involved in serotonin receptor function.
Step 3: The molecule also has a quinolone-like structure, which may interact with enzymes such as cytochrome P450s (CYP). Genes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 are involved in drug metabolism and could be affected by this molecule.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a nitro group and a carboxylic acid could indicate potential interaction with ion channels. Gene CNR1 encodes the cannabinoid receptor, which might be influenced by the molecule's structure.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CNR1. These genes are likely to have a functional relationship with the described molecule due to their roles in neurotransmission and metabolism. Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CNR1. These genes are likely to have a functional relationship with the described molecule due to their roles in neurotransmission and metabolism.
