Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])CSc1ccccc1C(=O)[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound with a central carbon atom double-bonded to a carbonyl group (C=O), and this carbonyl group is further connected to an oxygen atom that has a negative charge (-). This structure suggests it might be a derivative of a carboxylic acid or similar functional group. The presence of multiple aromatic rings (indicated by the benzene rings) and a carboxylate group (O-) indicates it could be a bioactive compound.
Step 2: The aromatic rings and the carboxylate group are common features in molecules that interact with certain receptors and enzymes, particularly those involved in signal transduction pathways and drug metabolism. The negative charge on the oxygen in the carboxylate group could indicate it is a negatively charged molecule, which might influence its interactions with positively charged sites on proteins or nucleic acids.
Step 3: Given the molecular structure, this compound likely interacts with receptors that have binding sites for acidic or negatively charged ligands. This includes G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are involved in various signaling pathways and are encoded by genes such as DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), HTR1A (Serotonin receptor 1A), HTR2A (Serotonin receptor 2A), HTR2B (Serotonin receptor 2B), and HTR2C (Serotonin receptor 2C).
Step 4: The molecule's structure also suggests potential interaction with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4, which are part of the cytochrome P450 family. These enzymes metabolize a wide range of drugs, including many that target neurotransmitter systems.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and the interactions described, the related genes include: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4.
Summary of related genes: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4.
