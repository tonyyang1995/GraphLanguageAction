Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Nc1cc(Cl)c(NC2=[NH+]CCN2)c(Cl)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure featuring a pyrrole ring fused with a benzene ring, and it contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge, indicating a potential interaction with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or proton transporters.
Step 2: The presence of multiple chlorine atoms suggests a possible role in inhibiting enzymes involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics, such as CYP enzymes.
Step 3: The molecule's structure may interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to its aromatic nature and the presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocycle, which could potentially affect receptors like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are dopamine receptors.
Step 4: Given the presence of a benzene ring and a nitrogen atom with a positive charge, the molecule might also interact with voltage-gated sodium channels, such as SCN1A, SCN2A, or SCN3A, although these are not listed in the provided gene set.
Step 5: Considering the above points, the molecule may be related to the following genes: CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- DRD2
- DRD3
- DRD4
Note: The gene SCN1A, SCN2A, and SCN3A were considered but not included in the final list since they were not part of the provided gene set. The focus was on the provided genes that could reasonably interact with the described molecular features. Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring fused with a benzene ring, suggesting potential interactions with enzymes or receptors that have similar structural motifs.
Step 2: The presence of a positively charged nitrogen atom indicates the molecule could interact with ion channels or transporters, particularly those involved in proton transport.
Step 3: Multiple chlorine atoms in the molecule suggest it might inhibit certain metabolic enzymes, specifically CYP enzymes, which are known to metabolize xenobiotics.
Step 4: The aromatic structure and nitrogen heterocycle could lead to interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly dopamine receptors like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule is likely related to the following genes: CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
Note: The genes CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 are closely related to CYP2D6, so CYP2C19 is included in the list for completeness. Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring fused with a benzene ring, which is characteristic of many pharmaceutical compounds that interact with various biological targets.
Step 2: The presence of a positively charged nitrogen atom (quaternary ammonium) suggests the molecule could act as an agonist or antagonist for ion channels or receptors, particularly those involved in neurotransmission
