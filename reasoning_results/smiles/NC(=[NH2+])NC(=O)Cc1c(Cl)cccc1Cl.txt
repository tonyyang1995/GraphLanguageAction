Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NC(=[NH2+])NC(=O)Cc1c(Cl)cccc1Cl, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring, which is part of the N-terminal amide group of the first amine (NH2+). This structural feature suggests that the molecule might interact with proteins containing amine-binding sites.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) and an amide (-CONH) indicate potential interactions with enzymes or receptors that recognize or bind to such functional groups, particularly those involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 3: The halogenated benzene ring (Cl) could be recognized by certain drug transporters or receptors that are sensitive to aromatic compounds, including those involved in neurotransmission.
Step 4: Given the molecular structure and functional groups, the molecule might interact with receptors or transporters involved in neurotransmission or drug metabolism. This includes genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes like CYPs (cytochrome P450).
Step 5: Based on the molecular features and potential interactions, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, ESR1, PTGS1.
