Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COCC[NH+]1CC[NH+](Cc2ccc(-c3[n-]nc4c3C(=O)c3c(NC(=O)[N-]N5CCOCC5)cccc3-4)cc2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring, amine groups, and a carboxylic acid group. This structure suggests that it could interact with receptors or enzymes that have similar functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of an amine group (-NH+) indicates that this molecule could potentially act as a ligand for various G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are known to have binding sites for small molecules. Examples of such receptors include DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, all of which are involved in neurotransmission and are implicated in various neurological and psychiatric disorders.
Step 3: The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) might enable the molecule to interact with ion channels or other proteins that have acidic binding sites. For instance, KCNH2, which encodes a potassium channel, could be a potential target. Additionally, CYP enzymes, particularly CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are involved in drug metabolism, may also interact with this molecule due to their ability to bind to and modify various substrates.
Step 4: Given the complexity of the molecule and its multiple functional groups, it is likely that this compound could interact with a variety of targets rather than just a single gene. However, the primary interaction seems to be with receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways, such as those encoded by the genes listed above.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is most likely to be related to the following genes: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. These genes encode proteins that are directly involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism, making them the most probable targets for this compound. 
Summary of Related Genes: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
