Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccccc1OCCCn1c(=O)sc2ccccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex molecule that includes a benzene ring with multiple substitutions, an oxygen atom, and a cyclic amide (CON) group. This structure suggests the molecule may have pharmacological activity, particularly related to interactions with receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: Analyzing the structure further, the presence of a benzene ring and substituents like alkyl groups and a carboxamide suggest potential interactions with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways and neurotransmitter systems, which are often targets for drugs affecting various physiological processes.
Step 3: Considering the gene list provided, several genes encode receptors and enzymes that could interact with such a molecule. For instance, ADRB2 encodes the beta-2 adrenergic receptor, which might bind to the benzene ring and substituents due to its aromatic nature and hydrophobic binding sites.
Step 4: Additionally, CYP2D6, a member of the cytochrome P450 family, could metabolize this molecule, indicating a possible relationship through metabolic pathways. Other genes like HTR2A, encoding the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, might also be relevant given the molecule's structure and potential to modulate neurotransmission.
Step 5: Based on the structure and properties of the molecule, the related genes include ADRB2, CYP2D6, HTR2A.
Summary of related gene names:
- ADRB2
- CYP2D6
- HTR2A
These genes are directly or indirectly related to the molecule based on their potential to interact with or be affected by its structure. The relationship is likely through pharmacological mechanisms involving receptor binding and metabolic pathways.
