Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc(N=c2nc3c(c[n-]2)c(=O)n(-c2c(C)cccc2C)c2nc4ccccc4n32)cc(OC)c1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that includes a core structure with various functional groups such as amides, nitriles, and aromatic rings. Notably, the molecule contains a nitrile group (-CN) and an amide group (-CONH-), which are common in drugs targeting G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This suggests potential interactions with receptors that have these functional groups recognized.
Step 2: Among the listed genes, several encode for GPCRs, which are known to interact with ligands containing amides and nitriles. These include HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, all of which are serotonin receptors. Serotonin receptors often bind small molecules with amide and nitrile functionalities, making this molecule a plausible candidate for interaction with these receptors.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule's structure also hints at possible interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, due to its amide and nitrile functionalities, which are common substrates for these cytochrome P450 enzymes. However, based on the given list, no direct CYP-related genes are included.
Step 4: Given the presence of a benzene ring and other aromatic structures, the molecule could also interact with voltage-gated sodium channels, such as SCN1A, SCN2A, and SCN3A, though these genes are not present in the provided list.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and the potential interactions discussed, the related genes from the provided list are: HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes encode serotonin receptors, which are known to interact with ligands similar to the described molecule.
Summary of Related Genes:
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- HTR6
These genes encode serotonin receptors, which are likely targets for the described molecule due to its structural features. Other potential targets like CYP enzymes and voltage-gated sodium channels are not among the listed genes.
