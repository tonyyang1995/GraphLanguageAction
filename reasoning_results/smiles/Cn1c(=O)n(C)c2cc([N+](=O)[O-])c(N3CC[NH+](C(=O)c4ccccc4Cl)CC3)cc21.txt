Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cn1c(=O)n(C)c2cc([N+](=O)[O-])c(N3CC[NH+](C(=O)c4ccccc4Cl)CC3)cc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex small molecule, which includes an amide group (-CO-N), a pyrrolidine ring, and a quinoline-like structure with a chlorine atom attached. This structural pattern suggests the molecule might interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmission.
Step 2: Among the given genes, several are known to be involved in drug metabolism pathways. Specifically, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 are cytochrome P450 enzymes that metabolize a wide range of drugs, including antidepressants, analgesics, and antipsychotics. The presence of functional groups like the amide and aromatic rings in the molecule could potentially make it a substrate for these enzymes, indicating a potential interaction.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule contains a quinoline-like structure, which is characteristic of many ligands that bind to receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4). These receptors play crucial roles in neurotransmission and are often targeted by drugs affecting mood, pain perception, and other neurological functions.
Step 4: Furthermore, the molecule's structure also hints at its potential to interact with ion channels, such as the calcium channel CACNA1H, which may influence neuronal excitability and thus affect neurotransmission.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecules described in the SMILES string are most likely to be related to the following genes: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, and CACNA1H.
