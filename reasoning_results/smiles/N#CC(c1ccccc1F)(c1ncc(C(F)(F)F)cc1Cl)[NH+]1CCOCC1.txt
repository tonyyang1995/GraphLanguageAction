Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N#CC(c1ccccc1F)(c1ncc(C(F)(F)F)cc1Cl)[NH+]1CCOCC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a nitrogen atom double-bonded to a carbon atom (N#C), which is part of an aromatic ring system. This pattern is common in molecules that interact with receptors and transport proteins. The presence of fluorine (F) and chlorine (Cl) substituents suggests the molecule may have specific binding interactions due to their electronegativity.
Step 2: The molecule also contains an amide group (-CONH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which are functional groups often involved in interactions with enzymes and receptors. These functional groups could potentially interact with various proteins, including those encoded by the genes listed.
Step 3: Several of the listed genes are involved in drug metabolism pathways, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. The presence of multiple functional groups in the molecule suggests it could be metabolized by these enzymes, making it relevant to these genes.
Step 4: Other genes like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4 encode dopamine receptors, and HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 encode serotonin receptors. The aromatic ring system and amide group in the molecule might allow it to interact with these receptors, as many neurotransmitters and drugs do.
Step 5: Given the structure and functional groups of the molecule, it is likely to be related to the genes involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and neurotransmitter receptor function (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
