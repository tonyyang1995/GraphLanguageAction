Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string C[N+](C)(C)CCO contains a positively charged nitrogen atom (N+) which is part of an amine group, and it is attached to a benzene ring. This structure suggests that the molecule could be an amine derivative and potentially a ligand for receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and a hydroxyl group (-OH) indicates that this molecule could interact with various enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize a wide range of drugs.
Step 3: The positively charged nitrogen could also indicate that the molecule might be able to bind to ion channels or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). For example, it might interact with DRD2 (Dopamine D2 receptor), HTR2A (Serotonin 5-HT2A receptor), or HRH1 (Histamine H1 receptor).
Step 4: Given the potential interaction with CYP enzymes and the possibility of binding to GPCRs, the related genes would include those involved in neurotransmitter signaling and drug metabolism.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related genes to this molecule are: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A, and HRH1.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- DRD2
- HTR2A
- HRH1 Step 1: The molecule has a positively charged nitrogen atom (N+) which is part of an amine group, indicating it could be an amine derivative.
Step 2: It contains a benzene ring and a hydroxyl group (-OH), suggesting potential interactions with drug-metabolizing enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 3: The positively charged nitrogen might allow the molecule to bind to ion channels or GPCRs, such as DRD2, HTR2A, and HRH1.
Step 4: Considering the potential interactions with CYP enzymes and GPCRs, the related genes include those involved in neurotransmitter signaling and drug metabolism.
Step 5: The related gene names are: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A, and HRH1. 
- HRH1 Step 1: The molecule has a positively charged nitrogen atom (N+), indicating it could be an amine derivative.
Step 2: It includes a benzene ring and a hydroxyl group (-OH), suggesting potential interactions with drug-metabolizing enzymes.
Step 3: The positively charged nitrogen might enable binding to ion channels or GPCRs.
Step 4: Considering the structure, the molecule could interact with genes involved in neurotransmitter signaling and drug metabolism.
Step 5: The related genes are CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2,
