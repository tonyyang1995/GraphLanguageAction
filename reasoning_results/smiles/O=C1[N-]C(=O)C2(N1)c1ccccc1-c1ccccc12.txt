Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C1[N-]C(=O)C2(N1)c1ccccc1-c1ccccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule in question is a complex organic compound with a structure that includes an amide (N-C=O), a benzene ring, and multiple nitrogen atoms. This structure suggests the molecule could be involved in interactions with proteins that have similar functional groups or motifs.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of the benzene ring and nitrogen-containing groups like amides and amines are common in ligands for receptors and enzymes that interact with neurotransmitters, hormones, and other signaling molecules. This hints at potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes.
Step 3: Among the provided genes, several are known to encode for GPCRs and enzymes that could potentially interact with this molecule due to its chemical structure. These include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are all GPCRs involved in various signaling pathways.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule might also interact with enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are part of the cytochrome P450 family and play roles in drug metabolism. These enzymes could oxidize or modify the molecule, affecting its pharmacological activity.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis and the functional roles of the genes, the related gene names are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
