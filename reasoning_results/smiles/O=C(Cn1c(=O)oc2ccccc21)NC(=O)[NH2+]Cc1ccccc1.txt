Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Cn1c(=O)oc2ccccc21)NC(=O)[NH2+]Cc1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a cyano group (-CN) and a nitrile group (C#N), which are characteristic features of certain drug-like molecules that can interact with proteins involved in signal transduction and receptor binding.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (CONH2) suggests potential interactions with receptors or enzymes that have amine binding sites, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or enzymes like acetylcholinesterase.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a quinoline-like structure, which is known to interact with various receptors and ion channels, particularly those involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways.
Step 4: Given the molecular features, the molecule could potentially interact with genes encoding for GPCRs (e.g., CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) and ion channels (e.g., KCNH2).
Step 5: The molecule may also have affinity for enzymes involved in metabolism (e.g., CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) due to its functional groups.
Summary of related genes: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
