Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+](C)CCCN1c2ccccc2CCc2ccc(Cl)cc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with a central nitrogen atom that is positively charged (NH+), which suggests it may be an alkaloid or similar compound. This pattern indicates potential interactions with proteins that bind to or are influenced by basic molecules.
Step 2: The presence of multiple aromatic rings (indicated by the benzene ring structures) and a chlorine atom attached to one of the aromatic rings suggests this molecule could interact with enzymes involved in phase I metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: The molecule contains a quinoline-like structure (quinoline is part of the structure), which is often found in compounds that can modulate the activity of receptors such as adrenergic and cholinergic receptors. This pattern points towards possible interactions with ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and DRD2, among others, which encode for receptors that are activated by neurotransmitters like norepinephrine and acetylcholine.
Step 4: Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, this molecule might also interact with transporters, particularly those involved in neurotransmitter reuptake or efflux, such as SLC6A2 and SLC6A4, which are associated with the regulation of serotonin and dopamine levels.
Step 5: Considering the molecule's overall structure and the specific functional groups present, it is likely to have interactions with several genes involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways, including HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and SIGMAR1, which are all involved in the modulation of serotonin and other neurotransmitters.
