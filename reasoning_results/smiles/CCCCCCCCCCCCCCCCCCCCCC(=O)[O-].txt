Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)[O-] corresponds to 12-cis-retinoic acid (RA), a metabolite of vitamin A. This molecule has a long alkyl chain and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) attached to an oxygen atom, which forms a negative ion due to the presence of the [O-]. The long alkyl chain is characteristic of retinoids, a class of compounds that play crucial roles in cellular differentiation, growth, and development.
Step 2: Retinoic acid interacts with nuclear receptors known as retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs). These receptors are transcription factors that bind DNA and regulate gene expression. The interaction between RA and its receptors can modulate the activity of several genes involved in various physiological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.
Step 3: The related genes in this context include those that are directly regulated by retinoic acid signaling, such as PTGS1 (cyclooxygenase-1), which is involved in prostaglandin synthesis, and SLC6A4 (solute carrier family 6 member 4), which is responsible for transporting neurotransmitters like serotonin and norepinephrine. Additionally, retinoic acid can influence the expression of genes involved in neurogenesis and neuronal plasticity, such as HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A) and HTR2C (serotonin receptor 2C).
Step 4: Furthermore, retinoic acid signaling can impact the expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, such as CDK2 (cyclin-dependent kinase 2) and MCL1 (myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1), which are key regulators of cell survival.
Step 5: Based on the interactions between the molecule and the described gene features, the related gene names are: PTGS1, SLC6A4, HTR2A, HTR2C, CDK2, and MCL1.
Summary of related gene names:
- PTGS1
- SLC6A4
- HTR2A
- HTR2C
- CDK2
- MCL1
