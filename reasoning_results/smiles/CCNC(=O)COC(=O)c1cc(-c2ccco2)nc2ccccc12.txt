Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that includes a core structure consisting of a benzene ring with various substituents such as amide groups, hydroxyl groups, and a cyclohexane ring. This structural complexity suggests the molecule could be involved in interactions with multiple biological targets, including receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: Analyzing the molecule's substituents, we see an amide group (N-C=O), which is common in drugs targeting receptors and enzymes through covalent or non-covalent binding. Additionally, the presence of a hydroxyl group (-OH) indicates potential for hydrogen bonding, which is crucial for receptor-ligand interactions.
Step 3: Considering the genes provided, those related to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 are likely candidates due to the molecule's potential to interact via hydrogen bonding and other molecular recognition features.
Step 4: Furthermore, genes involved in metabolism and drug transport, like CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and SLC6A4, may also be relevant because the molecule's structure could influence its metabolic pathways or transport across cell membranes.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the potentially relevant genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and SLC6A4. These genes are associated with receptors and enzymes that might interact with the described molecule based on its structural characteristics.
