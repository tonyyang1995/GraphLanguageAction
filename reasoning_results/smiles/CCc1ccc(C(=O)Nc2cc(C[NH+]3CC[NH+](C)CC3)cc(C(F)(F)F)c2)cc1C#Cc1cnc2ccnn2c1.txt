Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCc1ccc(C(=O)Nc2cc(C[NH+]3CC[NH+](C)CC3)cc(C(F)(F)F)c2)cc1C#Cc1cnc2ccnn2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is common in many drug-like molecules due to its aromaticity and ability to form stable structures. This feature suggests that the molecule might interact with proteins that have binding sites for aromatic compounds.
Step 2: The molecule also has a quinoline moiety (quinolin-8-one), which is known to bind to certain receptors and enzymes. This could indicate potential interactions with genes encoding proteins that have quinoline-binding sites or are involved in metabolism pathways that include quinolines.
Step 3: The presence of multiple functional groups such as amides, carboxylic acids, and amines suggests the molecule may be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors. Specifically, the amide and carboxylic acid functionalities are common in drugs targeting kinases, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), and other ion channels.
Step 4: Given the complex structure with aromatic rings and heteroatoms, this molecule could potentially interact with genes encoding ion channels and transporters, such as those involved in neurotransmitter reuptake or signaling pathways. For example, it might affect the activity of HTR1A (serotonin receptor), HTR2A (serotonin receptor), or SLC6A4 (serotonin transporter).
Step 5: Considering the molecular profile, the most likely related genes are those involved in neurotransmitter systems and signal transduction pathways, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4. These genes encode proteins that are directly or indirectly influenced by the molecule’s chemical structure and potential pharmacological activities.
