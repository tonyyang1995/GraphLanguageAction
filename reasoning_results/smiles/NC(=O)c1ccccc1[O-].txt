Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a derivative of nicotinamide, which is an amide of nicotinamide (vitamin B3) and contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), an amide group (-CONH2), and a benzene ring with multiple substituents. The presence of a carboxylic acid and amide group suggests this molecule could be involved in protein binding or enzymatic reactions.
Step 2: The benzene ring with substituents indicates that the molecule may interact with proteins containing hydrophobic binding sites, such as those involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways, which are often modulated by small molecules with aromatic structures.
Step 3: Given the structure of the molecule, it likely interacts with receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmitter systems, inflammatory responses, and cellular signaling. This interaction could be relevant to genes encoding for receptors and enzymes involved in these processes.
Step 4: Considering the potential interactions with GPCRs and enzymes, the molecule might be related to genes such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CNR1, and CYP2D6, as these genes encode receptors and enzymes that are known to interact with similar chemical moieties.
Step 5: Additionally, due to the presence of a carboxylic acid and amide groups, the molecule could also interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, potentially affecting genes like CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4.
