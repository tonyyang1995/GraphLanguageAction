Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC([NH2+]CCC(c1ccccc1)c1ccccc1)c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a nitrogen atom bearing a positive charge (N+), which is likely to be involved in electrostatic interactions with negatively charged residues on protein surfaces.
Step 2: The presence of multiple aromatic rings suggests potential for π-π stacking interactions with proteins that have similar structures.
Step 3: The molecule includes a pyrrolidine ring, which could interact with proteins through hydrogen bonding due to the presence of amine and alcohol functionalities.
Step 4: The overall structure may allow for binding to receptors or enzymes that have complementary shapes or functional groups, such as those involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 5: Given the structural features, the molecule could potentially interact with genes encoding proteins involved in neurotransmitter signaling, receptor activity, and drug metabolism.
