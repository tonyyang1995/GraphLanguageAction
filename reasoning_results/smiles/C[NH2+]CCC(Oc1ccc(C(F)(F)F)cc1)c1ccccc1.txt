Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH2+]CCC(Oc1ccc(C(F)(F)F)cc1)c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with multiple functional groups including an amine group (-NH2), a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and several aromatic rings. The presence of these functional groups suggests that the molecule could potentially interact with proteins involved in signal transduction, neurotransmission, and metabolism.
Step 2: Considering the structure of the molecule, it contains a benzene ring with fluorine substituents (F), which might be relevant for molecules that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are often involved in the regulation of various physiological processes and are associated with several genes listed here, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C.
Step 3: The presence of a carboxylic acid group could indicate that this molecule might act as an agonist or antagonist at ion channels or transporters. For example, molecules with similar structures have been shown to interact with voltage-gated sodium channels (like KCNH2) or neurotransmitter transporters (like SLC6A2 and SLC6A4).
Step 4: Given the complexity and the specific functional groups present, the molecule may also influence enzymes involved in drug metabolism. Enzymes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 play crucial roles in the metabolism of many drugs, and their activity can be modulated by various chemical structures.
Step 5: Based on the analysis of the molecule’s structure and its potential interactions with different types of biological targets, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, KCNH2, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. These genes are primarily involved in neurotransmission, signal transduction, and drug metabolism.
