Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(c1ccc2c(c1)OCO2)[NH+]1CCCCC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule, represented by the SMILES string O=C(c1ccc2c(c1)OCO2)[NH+]1CCCCC1, contains a benzene ring system with an amide group and a positively charged nitrogen atom. This structure suggests potential interactions with receptors or enzymes that have similar functional groups or binding sites.
Step 2: The positively charged nitrogen and the amide group could interact with proteins that have negatively charged regions or hydrogen-bonding sites, such as certain receptors or enzymes. Specifically, the positively charged nitrogen could form a salt bridge or hydrogen bond with acidic residues in protein binding sites.
Step 3: Given the presence of a benzene ring and the amide group, this molecule might be able to bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are known to have aromatic and polar regions for ligand binding. GPCRs include genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, all of which code for different subtypes of these receptors.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of the benzene ring and the amide group might also suggest potential interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics. These enzymes play a crucial role in drug metabolism and can affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of many medications.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule could be related to the genes coding for GPCRs and cytochrome P450 enzymes, specifically: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
