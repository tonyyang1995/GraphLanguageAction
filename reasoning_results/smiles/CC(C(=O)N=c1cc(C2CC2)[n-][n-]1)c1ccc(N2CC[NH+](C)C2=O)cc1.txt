Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C(=O)N=c1cc(C2CC2)[n-][n-]1)c1ccc(N2CC[NH+](C)C2=O)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains several functional groups such as an amide (C(=O)N), a substituted benzene ring (c1ccc(...cc1)), and a quaternary ammonium group ([n-][n-]). These functional groups suggest the molecule may interact with receptors or enzymes that have similar chemical features.
Step 2: The presence of a quaternary ammonium group and a substituted benzene ring indicates the molecule could be a ligand for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are involved in signaling pathways and are often targets for drugs due to their role in various physiological processes.
Step 3: Given the pattern of the molecule, it might bind to receptors like adrenergic receptors (e.g., ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and dopaminergic receptors (e.g., DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) due to its aromatic structure and basic nitrogen atom, which can form hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions with these receptors.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule’s structure might interact with enzymes such as CYP2D6, which is involved in the metabolism of many drugs, including those acting on neurotransmitter systems.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and potential interactions, the related genes would likely include those encoding GPCRs (adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors) and enzymes involved in drug metabolism (CYP2D6).
