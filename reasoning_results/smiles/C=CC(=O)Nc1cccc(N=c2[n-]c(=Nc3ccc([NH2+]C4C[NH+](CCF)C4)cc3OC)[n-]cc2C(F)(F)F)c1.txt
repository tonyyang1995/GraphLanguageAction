Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C=CC(=O)Nc1cccc(N=c2[n-]c(=Nc3ccc([NH2+]C4C[NH+](CCF)C4)cc3OC)[n-]cc2C(F)(F)F)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound with a structure that includes a benzene ring, an amide group (-CONH2), and multiple nitrogen atoms. The presence of a benzene ring and amide group suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways and drug metabolism. The nitrogen atoms could participate in hydrogen bonding or form part of a pharmacophore for receptor binding.
Step 2: The nitrogen atoms, particularly those involved in the amide group and the substituted nitrogens, suggest possible interactions with receptors that contain amino acid residues or have hydrophilic patches. Among the provided genes, several are known to encode receptors or enzymes that interact with small molecules through such mechanisms.
Step 3: Specifically, the amine groups and the overall structure hint at potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are involved in various signaling pathways and are often targeted by drugs due to their role in neurotransmission, hormone action, and other physiological processes. Genes encoding GPCRs include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a benzene ring and amide group could indicate potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). These enzymes are crucial for the biotransformation of xenobiotics, including many pharmaceuticals.
Step 5: Based on the structural features of the molecule, it appears to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. These genes encode receptors and enzymes that may interact directly or indirectly with the molecule through various mechanisms such as ligand binding, metabolic activation, or signaling pathway modulation.
