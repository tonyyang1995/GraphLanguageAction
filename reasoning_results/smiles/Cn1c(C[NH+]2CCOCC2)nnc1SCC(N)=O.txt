Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cn1c(C[NH+]2CCOCC2)nnc1SCC(N)=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing several functional groups such as an amide (-CONH), an ester (-COO), and a sulfur-containing group (-SC). These functional groups are characteristic of molecules that can interact with various proteins, particularly those involved in receptor binding or enzyme activity.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (+NH) suggests that the molecule could be a ligand for receptors that recognize positively charged moieties. This feature is relevant to genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which often bind to ligands with positive charges.
Step 3: The molecule contains a benzene ring, which is a common structural motif found in many drugs and ligands that interact with enzymes and receptors. Benzene rings can participate in aromatic interactions and hydrogen bonding, which are important for binding to protein targets. This structural feature is relevant to genes encoding enzymes or receptors that might have hydrophobic binding sites or active sites.
Step 4: Given the complexity of the molecule, it is likely to interact with multiple proteins, possibly affecting several pathways. However, based on the structural analysis, the molecule may be more specifically related to genes encoding receptors or enzymes that contain binding sites for similar functional groups or structural motifs.
Step 5: Considering the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes include those encoding GPCRs and enzymes, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, ESR1, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KDR, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, PTGS1, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4. These genes encode proteins that are involved in neurotransmitter signaling, hormone response, and drug metabolism.
