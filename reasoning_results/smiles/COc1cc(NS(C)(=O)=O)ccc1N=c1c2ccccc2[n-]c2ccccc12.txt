Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc(NS(C)(=O)=O)ccc1N=c1c2ccccc2[n-]c2ccccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule contains a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring system, specifically a pyrrolidine ring fused to a pyridine ring, which is part of a larger aromatic structure. This structural feature is often found in molecules that interact with receptors and transporters, particularly those involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a sulfonamide group (-NS(C)(=O)) suggests that this molecule could potentially act as an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors that bind such groups. Sulfonamides are known to interact with various proteins, including ion channels and transporters.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a nitrile (-CN) group, which can be involved in the formation of covalent bonds with proteins, particularly cysteine residues, leading to potential modulation of protein function. This type of interaction is common in drugs targeting kinases and other enzymes.
Step 4: Given the molecular structure and functional groups present, the molecule is likely to interact with proteins involved in neurotransmitter systems and signaling pathways. Specifically, it could affect G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), ion channels, and enzymes involved in the metabolism and transport of neurotransmitters.
Step 5: Based on the described interactions and the presence of specific functional groups, the molecule may be related to several genes encoding proteins involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, and CNR1.
Summary of related gene names:
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- ADRB2
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- HTR6
- DRD2
- DRD3
- DRD4
- CNR1
These genes encode proteins that are involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release and receptor binding, making them relevant to the potential pharmacological actions of the described molecule.
