Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with a quinolone-like structure, which includes a phenyl ring fused to a pyridine ring. This pattern is often found in compounds that interact with receptors and transporters involved in neurotransmission and hormone signaling.
Step 2: The molecule also has a thioether group (-S-) attached to a carbon chain, which is characteristic of certain ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). These receptors are known to be involved in various physiological processes, including neurotransmission and hormone regulation.
Step 3: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) suggests the molecule could be an inhibitor or activator of enzymes such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics.
Step 4: The overall structure indicates potential interactions with receptors and enzymes related to neurotransmission and hormonal pathways, such as DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, and CYP2C9.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and potential interactions, the related genes include: DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, CYP2C9, CYP2C19.
