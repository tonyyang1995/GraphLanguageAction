Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc2c(=Nc3ccc(NC(=O)c4ccccc4)cc3)[n-]cnc2cc1OCCC[NH+]1CCOCC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this is relevant.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring system, which is characteristic of many ligands that interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature suggests potential interactions with genes encoding GPCRs.
Step 2: The presence of a quinoline moiety and a carboxamide group indicates that the molecule may have affinity for enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are part of the cytochrome P450 family.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a pyridine ring with a nitrogen atom, which could indicate potential interactions with ion channels or transporters, such as those encoded by KCNH2, which is associated with cardiac potassium channels.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a benzene ring with a nitro group and a phenolic hydroxyl group might suggest possible interactions with enzymes like CYP1A2, which metabolizes compounds containing aromatic rings and oxygen functionalities.
Step 5: Based on the identified structural features, the molecule is potentially related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, CYP2D6, KCNH2, and OPRL1.
