Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc2c(cc1OC)C1CC(O)C(CC(C)C)C[NH+]1CC2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a benzene ring with a hydroxyl group (-OH), an amide group (-CONH2), and a pyrrolidine ring. This complex structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes or receptors that have similar chemical functionalities.
Step 2: Among the provided genes, several are associated with enzymes involved in drug metabolism. These include CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are members of the cytochrome P450 family responsible for metabolizing many drugs and xenobiotics. The presence of an amide and a hydroxyl group in the molecule indicates it could be a substrate for these enzymes.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule has a quinoline-like structure (quinoline is a common pharmacophore in many drugs). Genes like ABCB1, which encodes P-glycoprotein, play a role in drug transport across cell membranes. A molecule with a quinoline-like structure might interact with this protein, affecting its function.
Step 4: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule suggests it could interact with proteins containing amino acid residues, such as neurotransmitter receptors. Genes like HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode serotonin receptors, could be relevant due to their affinity for molecules with similar structural features.
Step 5: Given the complexity of the molecule and its potential to interact with multiple types of proteins, it is likely to be related to several of the listed genes. The related genes include:
- CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4
- ABCB1
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
