Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Nc1cc(C(Cl)=C(Cl)Cl)c(S(N)(=O)=O)cc1S(N)(=O)=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with multiple functional groups including a nitro group (-N), aromatic rings, a sulfoxide group (S(=O)), and halogen substituents (Cl). The presence of these groups suggests that the molecule may interact with proteins involved in drug metabolism and transport, as well as receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: Among the listed genes, several are known to be involved in drug metabolism and transport, such as CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which encode cytochrome P450 enzymes responsible for metabolizing various drugs. Additionally, ABCB1 encodes a multidrug resistance protein that is crucial for transporting certain drugs across cell membranes.
Step 3: The molecule's structure also includes potential binding sites for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are involved in signal transduction pathways. Genes like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, encoding dopamine receptors, and HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, encoding serotonin receptors, could be relevant due to their roles in neurotransmission.
Step 4: Furthermore, the presence of a sulfoxide group might indicate interactions with enzymes like SULTs (sulfotransferases) and other metabolic pathways. This could relate to genes such as CYP1A2, which is involved in the metabolism of various substrates including some pharmaceuticals.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and its potential interaction points with the listed genes, the most likely related genes are those involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ABCB1), GPCR signaling (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), and possibly metabolism (CYP1A2).
Summary of related gene names: CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ABCB1, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2.
