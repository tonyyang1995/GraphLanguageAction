Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)c1[nH]c(C)c(C[NH+](CCc2ccccc2)C(=O)CCC(=O)[O-])c1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure including an amide group (C=O), an alcohol group (OH), and a benzene ring with multiple substituents. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes or receptors that have similar chemical functionalities.
Step 2: Among the provided genes, those involved in metabolism (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) are likely to interact with this molecule due to its amide and alcohol groups, which are common substrates for cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a benzene ring and substituents may suggest interactions with genes involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, as these genes encode receptors that often bind small molecules with aromatic rings.
Step 4: Furthermore, the presence of a benzene ring and the overall structure of the molecule might also indicate potential interactions with genes encoding ion channels, such as KCNH2, which encodes the hERG potassium channel.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the following genes are likely to be involved in interactions with the given molecule: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and KCNH2.
