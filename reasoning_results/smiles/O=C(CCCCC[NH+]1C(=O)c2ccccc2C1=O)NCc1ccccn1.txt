Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(CCCCC[NH+]1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O)NCc1ccccn1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule contains a quinoline ring system and an imidazole ring, which are common features in many drugs that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). These receptors often modulate neurotransmission and are associated with various neurological and psychiatric disorders.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a pyridine ring and a benzene ring, which are typical substituents found in ligands for receptors such as dopamine receptors (DRDs), serotonin receptors (HTRs), and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRMs). These types of receptors play key roles in regulating mood, cognition, and other brain functions.
Step 3: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH-) suggests potential interactions with enzymes like CYP2D6, which metabolizes many drugs, including those targeting neurotransmitter systems.
Step 4: The nitrogen-containing heterocycles (imidazole and quinoline rings) indicate possible interactions with ion channels and transporters, such as KCNH2 (a voltage-gated potassium channel) and SLC6A4 (a serotonin transporter).
Step 5: Given the molecular structure and functional groups, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways, including DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2D6, KCNH2, and SLC6A4.
