Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+](C)C=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string C[NH+](C)C=O is an amide compound containing a nitrogen atom with a positive charge. This structure is common in drugs that act as agonists or inhibitors of various receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The positive charge on the nitrogen suggests the molecule could interact with negatively charged sites on proteins, such as ion channels or receptors, which often have acidic residues like aspartate or glutamate. This interaction pattern might be relevant to genes encoding for receptors or ion channels.
Step 3: Given the presence of an amide group (C=O), this molecule could potentially inhibit enzymes that contain amide bonds, such as certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP). This is particularly true for CYP2D6, known to metabolize many drugs, and CYP3A4, which is involved in the metabolism of a wide range of substrates.
Step 4: The molecule's basic nature due to the positively charged nitrogen could also influence its interaction with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are often targeted by drugs. Genes such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, encoding dopamine receptors, and HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, encoding serotonin receptors, could be relevant.
Step 5: Considering the potential interactions with receptors and enzymes, the related genes include: CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes encode proteins that could directly interact with or be influenced by the molecule described.
