Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NC(=[NH2+])c1ccc(OCCCCCOc2ccc(C(N)=[NH2+])cc2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains an amide (NC=) and a substituted amine (NH2+) which are functional groups that often interact with receptors and enzymes. This suggests potential interactions with genes encoding for receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The molecule also has a cyclic structure containing oxygen (O), carbon (C), and nitrogen (N) atoms, which is indicative of a small molecule that could potentially bind to or modulate the activity of proteins involved in cellular signaling pathways.
Step 3: Among the listed genes, those primarily involved in neurotransmitter receptors and signaling pathways, such as DRD2 (Dopamine Receptor D2), HTR1A (Serotonin Receptor 1A), HTR2A (Serotonin Receptor 2A), and HTR2B (Serotonin Receptor 2B), are likely to be directly influenced by the molecule due to its chemical structure and potential to interact with receptor sites.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of aromatic rings and heteroatoms (such as nitrogen and oxygen) might suggest the molecule could influence genes involved in drug metabolism and transport, like CYP2D6 (Cytochrome P450 2D6), SLC6A2 (Solute Carrier Family 6 Member 2), and SLC6A4 (Solute Carrier Family 6 Member 4).
Step 5: Considering the potential interactions based on the molecule's structure, the related genes are: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, CYP2D6, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4. These genes are primarily involved in neurotransmitter signaling and drug metabolism.
