Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1[n-]c2cc(Cl)ccc2o1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this relationship might be significant.
Step 1: The molecule has a structure that includes a benzene ring, a cyano group (-CN), a nitrogen atom with a negative charge, and a phenol (OH) group. This pattern suggests the molecule could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction or receptor binding, given its functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of the cyano group and the nitrogen atom with a negative charge indicates potential for interactions with ion channels or receptors that have positively charged binding sites or ion-conducting pathways. This is relevant to genes coding for ion channel proteins such as KCNH2, which encodes the hERG potassium channel.
Step 3: The phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) may allow for hydrogen bonding interactions, which are common in ligand-receptor interactions. This feature is particularly relevant to genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which all code for serotonin receptors.
Step 4: The overall structure does not directly suggest interactions with enzymes encoded by genes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4, as it lacks typical substrate structures recognized by these enzymes. However, it could potentially interact with certain drug targets that are involved in the metabolism or transport of molecules similar to this one.
Step 5: Given the molecular features, the most likely related genes include those coding for ion channels and GPCRs due to the presence of charged and polar functional groups that could form interactions with these types of proteins. Specifically, the related gene names are:
- KCNH2
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- HTR6
These genes are listed based on the potential for the molecule to interact with their encoded proteins through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions.
