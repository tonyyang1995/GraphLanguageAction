Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(C[NH+]1CC[NH+](S(=O)(=O)c2ccc(F)cc2)CC1)Nc1ccc2c(c1)OCO2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule is a complex organic compound with multiple functional groups and rings, including an amide (N-C), a carboxylic acid (C=O), an ester (S=O), and aromatic rings. It contains nitrogen heteroatoms that are likely involved in forming various interactions with proteins.
Step 2: Notably, the molecule includes a quaternary ammonium group (N+), which can form electrostatic interactions with negatively charged residues on protein surfaces, particularly those involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways.
Step 3: The presence of a benzene ring with substituents such as phenyl, fluoro-phenyl, and alkyl groups suggests potential for binding to transmembrane domains and hydrophobic pockets of membrane proteins, which are common targets for drugs acting through GPCRs.
Step 4: Given the structural features and the likely interaction profile, this molecule could be related to several genes encoding GPCRs and enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways. Specifically, it might interact with receptors like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, all of which are known to have significant roles in neurotransmission and hormone signaling.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule's ability to bind to and modulate enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism, further indicates its potential interaction with genes encoding these enzymes. These enzymes play crucial roles in the biotransformation of many drugs, including those that target the aforementioned GPCRs.
