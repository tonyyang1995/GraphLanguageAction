Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C1c2ccccc2S(=O)(=O)[NH+]1Cc1ccccc1F, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound containing a carbonyl group (O=C), a benzene ring system, a sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)), and an amide group ([NH+]). These structural features suggest the molecule may interact with proteins involved in signal transduction, metabolism, and neurotransmission.
Step 2: The benzene ring system and the presence of fluorine atoms (F) are characteristic of molecules that can interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). The specific arrangement of these functional groups might enable the molecule to bind to GPCRs, which are often associated with various signaling pathways and neurotransmitter systems.
Step 3: Among the listed genes, several are known to encode for GPCRs or enzymes that are closely associated with GPCRs. For instance, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 all encode for subtypes of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and serotonin receptors, respectively, which are GPCRs involved in neurotransmission.
Step 4: Additionally, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 are cytochrome P450 enzymes that play a role in the metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics. The presence of a sulfonyl group and the overall complexity of the molecule suggest it could be a substrate for these enzymes, potentially affecting their activity.
Step 5: Based on the structure and functional groups present in the molecule, it is likely to be related to the following genes: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2D6, and CYP2C19. These genes encode proteins that are directly involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism.
