Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc2[n-]c(N(C)CCCNC(=O)C3CCCO3)nc(=N)c2cc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a tricyclic core structure with a nitrogen atom that is part of a heterocyclic ring system. This structure is often found in ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are involved in signal transduction pathways and are known to interact with various neurotransmitters and hormones.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a pyrrolidine ring attached to the tricyclic core, which is a common feature in many ligands for GPCRs. Pyrrolidine rings can form hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions, contributing to the binding affinity of the molecule to its target receptor.
Step 3: Notably, the presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH-) and an amide group (-CON-) within the molecule suggests potential interactions with enzymes such as CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics. These enzymes are known to catalyze the oxidation of substrates containing these functional groups.
Step 4: The molecule also has a pyrazole ring attached to the tricyclic core, which is another common motif in GPCR ligands. Pyrazoles can participate in multiple hydrogen bonding interactions, which can contribute to the specificity and affinity of the molecule towards its receptor.
Step 5: Based on the structural features described, the molecule is most likely to be related to GPCRs and enzymes involved in drug metabolism. Therefore, the related genes include those encoding GPCRs and drug-metabolizing enzymes. Specifically, these genes are: ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4.
Summary of related gene names: ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP3A4.
