Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC[NH+]1C(=O)C=CC1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is an N-substituted imidazolium derivative, which is a heterocyclic compound containing an imidazole ring with a nitrogen atom substituted by an alkyl group. This type of structure is often found in ligands that interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are membrane proteins that play crucial roles in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH2) and a ketone group (=O) in the molecule suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism. Specifically, the carboxamide group could be recognized by enzymes such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are known to metabolize drugs containing similar functional groups.
Step 3: The imidazolium ring with the attached alkyl chain might also interact with transporters, particularly those that are involved in the uptake or efflux of molecules across cell membranes. For example, the ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein) could be influenced by this molecule due to its ability to recognize and transport various substrates, including heterocycles and amides.
Step 4: Given the potential for interaction with transporters and metabolic enzymes, it is likely that this molecule could affect the activity of neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels. For instance, the cholinergic receptors CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4, as well as the dopaminergic receptor DRD2, could be modulated by this molecule due to their affinity for heterocyclic ligands and their involvement in signaling pathways.
Step 5: Additionally, the presence of a ketone group and an amide could influence the activity of enzymes involved in prostaglandin synthesis, such as PTGS1 (COX-1), which is known to be inhibited by certain nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
