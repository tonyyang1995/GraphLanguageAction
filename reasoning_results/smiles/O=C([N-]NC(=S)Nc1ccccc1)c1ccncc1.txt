Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([N-]NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1)c1ccncc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that includes an imidazole ring (N), a thiophene ring (S), and a benzene ring (C) with various substituents. This structure suggests the molecule could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, particularly those associated with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels.
Step 2: The presence of the thiophene and benzene rings, along with the imidazole group, indicates the molecule likely has hydrophobic and aromatic regions. These characteristics are common in molecules that bind to receptors such as adrenergic and cholinergic receptors, which are known to have similar structural preferences.
Step 3: Considering the aromatic and heterocyclic nature of the molecule, it might interact with enzymes like CYP2D6, which metabolizes many drugs and xenobiotics, and CYP3A4, which is involved in the metabolism of numerous pharmaceuticals. These enzymes recognize substrates with similar chemical structures.
Step 4: The molecule's potential to interact with ion channels and receptors implies it may affect neurotransmitter systems. Therefore, it could be related to genes encoding for receptors and ion channels involved in these systems, such as HTR2A (serotonin receptor), HTR2B, and HTR2C (serotonin receptors).
Step 5: Given the above considerations, the molecule is likely related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, and CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
