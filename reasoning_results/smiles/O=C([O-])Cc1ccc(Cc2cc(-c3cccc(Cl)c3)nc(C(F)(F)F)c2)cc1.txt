Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])Cc1ccc(Cc2cc(-c3cccc(Cl)c3)nc(C(F)(F)F)c2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple functional groups such as an amide (-CONH2), a ketone (C=O), and aromatic rings (benzene rings). It also includes substituents like alkyl chains, halogens (fluorine), and a negatively charged oxygen atom.
Step 2: This structure suggests the molecule could interact with various biological targets, including receptors and enzymes, due to its diverse functional groups and aromatic regions.
Step 3: Among the given genes, several are involved in the metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics, which might be relevant if the molecule has pharmacological activity. These include CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which encode enzymes that are part of the cytochrome P450 family responsible for metabolizing many drugs.
Step 4: Other genes listed are involved in neurotransmitter systems, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which encode receptors for serotonin and dopamine. If the molecule interacts with neurotransmitters or their receptors, these genes would be directly relevant.
Step 5: Given the complexity and potential pharmacological activity of the molecule, it could be related to several of the mentioned genes, particularly those involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmitter signaling.
