Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C1[N-]S(=O)(=O)c2ccccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string O=C1[N-]S(=O)(=O)c2ccccc21 contains a nitrile (-N) group and a sulfone (S(=O)(=O)) moiety. These functional groups are indicative of potential interactions with receptors that have binding sites for similar chemical functionalities.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrile group suggests possible interaction with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which often bind small molecules containing nitrogen heterocycles or amine functionalities. This could potentially include genes such as DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), HTR1A (Serotonin receptor 1A), and CHRM1 (Cholinergic receptor muscarinic 1).
Step 3: The sulfone group might also interact with certain enzymes or receptors, particularly those involved in metabolic pathways or signaling cascades. CYP2D6 (Cytochrome P450 2D6) is an enzyme that metabolizes many drugs, and its activity could be affected by compounds containing sulfone groups.
Step 4: Considering the overall structure and the presence of both nitrile and sulfone groups, the molecule could have multiple points of interaction with different genes. However, the primary focus would likely be on GPCRs due to the nitrile group, and metabolic enzymes like CYP2D6 due to the sulfone group.
Step 5: Based on the analysis, the related genes to this molecule are primarily DRD2, HTR1A, and CHRM1 for their GPCR functions, and CYP2D6 for its role in metabolism. The remaining genes listed do not appear to have a direct structural or functional connection to the molecule's characteristics.
Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2
- HTR1A
- CHRM1
- CYP2D6 Step 5: Based on the analysis, the related genes to this molecule are primarily DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), HTR1A (Serotonin receptor 1A), and CHRM1 (Cholinergic receptor muscarinic 1) for their GPCR functions, and CYP2D6 (Cytochrome P450 2D6) for its role in metabolism. The remaining genes listed do not appear to have a direct structural or functional connection to the molecule's characteristics. 
- CYP2D6
The molecule's nitrile group suggests interactions with GPCRs, while the sulfone group indicates potential interactions with metabolic enzymes. Therefore, the genes directly related to the molecule's structure and properties are DRD2, HTR1A, CHRM1, and CYP2D6. Other genes are less likely to be directly involved based on the given molecular features. Step 5: Summary of related gene names:
These genes are the most likely to have a direct relationship with the molecule due to the presence of a nitrile group (indicative of GPCR interactions) and a sulfone group (potentially affecting CYP2D6). The other genes listed do not have a clear structural or functional connection to the molecule's characteristics. Step
