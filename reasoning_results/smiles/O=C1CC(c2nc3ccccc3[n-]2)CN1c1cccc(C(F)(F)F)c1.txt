Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C1CC(c2nc3ccccc3[n-]2)CN1c1cccc(C(F)(F)F)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other type of explanation.
Step 1: The molecule contains a tricyclic structure with a benzene ring fused to a pyrrole ring, which is characteristic of molecules that can interact with serotonin receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) and a fluorophenyl group suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2D6 and CYP2C9.
Step 3: The overall structure and functional groups indicate possible binding to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly those involved in neurotransmission, like HTR2A and HTR2B.
Step 4: The molecule's aromatic and hydrophobic nature may facilitate binding to ion channels, potentially interacting with KCNH2, which encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel.
Step 5: Given the molecular features, the most likely related genes are: HTR2A, HTR2B, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, KCNH2. 
Summary of related genes: HTR2A, HTR2B, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, KCNH2. Step 1: The molecule contains a tricyclic structure with a benzene ring fused to a pyrrole ring, which is characteristic of molecules that can interact with serotonin receptors.
