Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(-c2cn3c(C)c(C(=O)Nc4cc(NC(C)=O)ccc4OC)sc3n2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule in question has a complex structure with multiple rings, including a benzene ring and a pyridine ring, which are often associated with interactions involving enzymes that metabolize drugs. This suggests potential interactions with genes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH2) and a carbonyl group (C=O) indicates the molecule could be an inhibitor or substrate for enzymes such as CYPs (Cytochrome P450) which are known to metabolize compounds containing these functional groups. Specifically, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are highly relevant due to their roles in metabolizing a wide range of drugs.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a quinoline-like structure, which is known to interact with certain receptors and transport proteins. For instance, it might affect the activity of receptors like DRD2 (Dopamine Receptor D2), which is involved in dopamine signaling and has been linked to various neurological disorders.
Step 4: Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, this molecule could potentially interact with multiple genes involved in different pathways. However, the most likely candidates based on its structure would be those involved in drug metabolism (CYP enzymes) and neurotransmitter signaling (DRD2).
Step 5: Based on the detailed analysis of the molecule's structure and its potential interactions, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and DRD2.
