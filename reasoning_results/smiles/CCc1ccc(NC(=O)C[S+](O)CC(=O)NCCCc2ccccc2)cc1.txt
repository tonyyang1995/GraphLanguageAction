Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCc1ccc(NC(=O)C[S+](O)CC(=O)NCCCc2ccccc2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains several functional groups such as amide (-CONH2), sulfonate ester (-S(=O)(O)C), and carboxyl (-COOH). These functional groups are often involved in binding to proteins and can modulate their activity.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of the sulfonate ester and carboxyl groups suggests that this molecule could potentially interact with enzymes or receptors that have binding sites for acidic or charged functional groups.
Step 3: The presence of the amide group, specifically within the context of an acetylcholine-like structure, indicates that the molecule might mimic or inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity. This is relevant to cholinergic systems, which are associated with genes like CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and DRD2, among others.
Step 4: Given the potential for the molecule to interact with enzymes (e.g., CYP enzymes), it may also affect the metabolism of other drugs or compounds, which could influence the expression or function of genes involved in drug metabolism such as CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4.
Step 5: Considering the structural features and potential interactions, the most likely related genes are those involved in cholinergic signaling (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2) and drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4).
Summary of related gene names:
- CHRM1
- CHRM3
- CHRM4
- DRD2
- CYP1A2
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP3A4
These genes are directly or indirectly related to the molecule based on its chemical structure and potential biological activities. Other genes listed are not as directly related due to the specific structural characteristics of the molecule.
