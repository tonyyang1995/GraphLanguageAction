Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this relationship might be important.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with a nitrogen atom attached, which is part of a larger structure that includes a pyrrole ring and a pyridine ring. This pattern suggests the molecule may interact with proteins involved in neurotransmission or receptor binding.
Step 2: The presence of a pyrrole ring and a pyridine ring, along with the nitrogen atom, indicates the potential for forming hydrogen bonds and other interactions with proteins that have similar functional groups, such as those containing amine or carboxylic acid functionalities.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) and a carbonyl group (C=O), which are known to participate in various biological processes, including enzyme inhibition and receptor modulation.
Step 4: Considering the structural features of the molecule, it is likely to interact with receptors or enzymes involved in G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathways, neurotransmitter metabolism, and steroid hormone signaling.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule may be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, ESR1, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
