Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(-c2nn3c(C)nnc3c3ccccc23)cc1S(=O)(=O)NCC[NH+]1CCOCC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a complex structure with multiple rings and functional groups, including a benzene ring, a thiophene ring, and several nitrogen-containing heterocycles. These features suggest that the molecule could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways or enzyme activities.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of a thiophene ring and a sulfoxide group (-S(=O)(=O)) indicates potential interactions with enzymes that contain thiol groups or are involved in redox reactions, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are known for their roles in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The molecule also includes amine functionalities (-NH+) and a quinoline-like structure, which might interact with receptors that have similar binding sites, such as HTR2A (serotonin 5-HT2A receptor) and DRD2 (dopamine D2 receptor).
Step 4: Given the presence of aromatic rings and hydrophobic regions, the molecule could potentially bind to membrane proteins like G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are involved in various signaling pathways. This aligns with the presence of genes encoding for GPCRs, such as CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and ADRA1D.
Step 5: Considering the diverse structural elements and potential for interaction with both metabolic enzymes and receptors, the most likely related genes from the provided list are: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, HTR2A, DRD2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and ADRA1D.
