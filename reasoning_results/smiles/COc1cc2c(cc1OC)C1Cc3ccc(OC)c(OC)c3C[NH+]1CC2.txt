Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc2c(cc1OC)C1Cc3ccc(OC)c(OC)c3C[NH+]1CC2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a substituted hydroxyl group and an amide group. These functional groups are common in ligands that interact with receptors and enzymes. The presence of these functional groups suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a cyclic structure with an oxygen atom (likely a lactam), which could indicate a possible interaction with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) or ion channels. This is due to the presence of functional groups such as amides, which are known to bind to GPCRs and ion channels.
Step 3: Considering the functional groups and structural elements present, the molecule may have the potential to interact with various receptors and enzymes, including those listed for GPCRs (such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) and enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.
Step 4: The molecule's complex structure and the presence of multiple functional groups suggest it might be a prodrug or a modulator of multiple targets, which could affect several signaling pathways and potentially interact with other genes involved in drug metabolism and response, such as ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein), SLC6A2, and SLC6A4.
Step 5: Given the above considerations, the molecule could be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CNR1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KDR, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, PTGS1, SIGMAR1, and SLC6A2. Step 5: List of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CNR1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KDR, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, PTGS1, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2.
