Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CSc1nn2c(C)c(Cl)c(C)nc2c1S(=O)(=O)c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex molecule that includes aromatic rings, heteroatoms (such as nitrogen and sulfur), and multiple functional groups including amides, thiols, and esters. This structural complexity suggests the molecule could interact with various biological targets.
Step 2: Analyzing the molecule's functional groups, we note the presence of a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) and an ester group (-COO-). These functional groups are often involved in binding to enzymes and receptors. The presence of a thioether (-S-) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) further indicates potential interactions with proteins such as kinases and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: Considering the pattern of substituents around the central carbon atoms, particularly the presence of halogens (chlorine) and alkyl chains, this molecule might interact with enzymes that are involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP (cytochrome P450) genes. For example, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 are known to metabolize a wide range of drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 4: Given the presence of a benzene ring system and the possibility of aromatic substitution, the molecule may also have affinity for GPCRs. Genes such as DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A), and CHRM1 (cholinergic receptor M1) encode receptors that could be targeted by this molecule due to their ability to bind to ligands with similar structures.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the related genes include: CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, and CHRM1.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, CHRM1.
