Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC[NH+](CC)CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure containing a pyrrolidine ring, an amide group, and a phenolic hydroxyl group. This structure suggests it could interact with proteins involved in neurotransmission or receptor signaling.
Step 2: The presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group (OH) indicates potential for interactions with enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: The amide group could be involved in hydrogen bonding or other interactions with proteins that have binding sites for such groups, possibly including receptors like DRD2 (Dopamine Receptor D2), HTR2A (Serotonin Receptor 5-HT2A), and HTR2B (Serotonin Receptor 5-HT2B).
Step 4: The overall structure may also suggest interactions with ion channels or transporters, given the presence of the pyrrolidine ring and the phenolic group, potentially involving genes like KCNH2 (Potassium Voltage-Gated Channel Subfamily H Member 2) and SLC6A4 (Solute Carrier Family 6 Member 4).
Step 5: Based on the molecular features, the molecule could be related to several genes involved in neurotransmission and metabolism, including CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, KCNH2, and SLC6A4.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- DRD2
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- KCNH2
- SLC6A4 Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring, which is a five-membered nitrogen-containing ring. This structural feature can form hydrogen bonds and participate in various interactions with biological molecules.
Step 2: The molecule includes an amide group (-CONH-), which can participate in hydrogen bonding and is often found in drug molecules that interact with protein targets.
Step 3: The presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) suggests the molecule could be metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, specifically CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize drugs and other xenobiotics.
Step 4: The molecule's overall structure, particularly the amide and phenolic groups, might allow it to interact with receptors involved in neurotransmission, such as dopamine receptors (DRD2) and serotonin receptors (HTR2A, HTR2B).
Step 5: Given the above structural features, the molecule could be related to genes involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmission, including CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, and SLC6A4 (which codes for a serotonin transporter).
