Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N=c1[n-]c2cc(Cl)ccc2o1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a triple bond to a carbon atom, followed by a negatively charged nitrogen atom. This pattern suggests potential interactions with receptors that have binding sites for similar nitrogen-containing molecules.
Step 2: The presence of chlorine atoms attached to the carbon chain indicates potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 3: The oxygen atom attached to the carbon chain may interact with receptors that have hydroxyl groups in their binding sites, such as DRD2, HTR1A, and HTR2A.
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule, including its aromatic rings and functional groups, could potentially interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, KDR, LCK, and SIGMAR1.
Step 5: The molecule may also interact with kinases, such as CDK2 and LCK, due to its potential to bind to ATP-binding sites.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, KDR, LCK, CDK2, SIGMAR1.
