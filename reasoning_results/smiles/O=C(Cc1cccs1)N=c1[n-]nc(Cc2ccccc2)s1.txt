Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Cc1cccs1)N=c1[n-]nc(Cc2ccccc2)s1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other type of explanation.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrile (-CN) group and a pyrrolidine ring, which are common in drugs that interact with ion channels and receptors. This suggests potential interaction with genes encoding for ion channels or receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and a carboxamide group (-CONH2) indicates the molecule could be an inhibitor or activator of enzymes such as CYPs (Cytochrome P450 enzymes), which are encoded by genes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
Step 3: The molecule has a quinoline-like structure, which might indicate interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or other proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and HRH1.
Step 4: The molecule’s overall structure, including its aromatic rings and amide groups, could suggest potential binding to nuclear receptor genes like NR1I2 (encoded by CYP1A2), NR1I3 (encoded by CYP3A4), and NR1H3 (encoded by LXRα).
Step 5: Considering the molecule’s potential to interact with ion channels, receptors, and enzymes, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, LCK, OPNK1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, and PTGS1.
