Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCNC(=O)c1oc2ccc(S(=O)(=O)[NH+]3CC(C)CC(C)C3)cc2c1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex molecule with several functional groups including an amide group (-CONH), a sulfonamide group (-S(=O)(=O)NH), and aromatic rings. These structural features suggest that the molecule could interact with enzymes or receptors involved in metabolic pathways or signal transduction.
Step 2: Among the given genes, those encoding enzymes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 are involved in drug metabolism, particularly phase I reactions such as oxidation, reduction, and hydrolysis. The presence of a sulfonamide group (-S(=O)(=O)NH) and an amide group (-CONH) in the molecule suggests it might be metabolized by these enzymes.
Step 3: Genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 are also present. These receptors typically bind to small molecules and neurotransmitters, and the aromatic ring system in the molecule could potentially fit into the binding pocket of these receptors.
Step 4: Additionally, genes encoding ion channels like KCNH2 and LCK, which are involved in signaling pathways, may also have interactions with this molecule due to its complex structure, although direct interaction is less likely compared to enzymes and receptors.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and potential interactions, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, and LCK. These genes are primarily involved in metabolism, signal transduction, and ion channel function. 
Summary of related genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, LCK.
