Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cn1c(-c2ccc3c(c2)OCO3)cc(=O)c2ccccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with a substituted cyclohexane moiety, indicating it may interact with receptors or transporters that have similar structural motifs. This suggests potential interactions with genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or transport proteins.
Step 2: The presence of an ester group (-COO-) and a phenolic hydroxyl (-OH) group could indicate the molecule has pharmacological activity, possibly acting as a ligand or substrate for enzymes involved in drug metabolism. This points to possible interactions with genes encoding cytochrome P450 enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 3: The aromatic ring structure and the presence of a carbonyl group suggest the molecule could be an agonist or antagonist for receptors that recognize such structures, likely targeting genes encoding GPCRs such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, HTR2A, and HTR2B.
Step 4: The presence of a carboxylic acid group could indicate the molecule might interact with ion channels or transporters, potentially involving genes like KCNH2 or SLC6A4.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is most likely related to the following genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, KCNH2, SLC6A4. 
Related Genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, KCNH2, SLC6A4.
