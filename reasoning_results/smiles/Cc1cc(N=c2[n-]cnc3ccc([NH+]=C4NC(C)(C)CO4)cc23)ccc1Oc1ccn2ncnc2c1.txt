Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc(N=c2[n-]cnc3ccc([NH+]=C4NC(C)(C)CO4)cc23)ccc1Oc1ccn2ncnc2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex molecule with multiple functional groups including a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring, a pyrrole ring, an amide group, and an ester group. These structural features suggest the molecule could have interactions with receptors or enzymes that contain similar functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring and an amide group indicates potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are known to bind ligands containing these functional groups. Examples of such receptors include adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), and dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4).
Step 3: The molecule also contains a carboxylic acid group and an ester linkage, which might indicate the ability to inhibit or activate certain enzymes involved in metabolism. CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) are known to be inhibited or activated by various compounds due to their involvement in oxidation reactions.
Step 4: Given the presence of an aromatic nitro group (-NO2) and an amine group (-NH2), the molecule may interact with enzymes or receptors that have a preference for these functional groups. For instance, the nitro group could interact with enzymes like cytochrome P450s, while the amine group could interact with receptors or enzymes that bind basic ligands.
Step 5: Based on the identified functional groups and structural features, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
