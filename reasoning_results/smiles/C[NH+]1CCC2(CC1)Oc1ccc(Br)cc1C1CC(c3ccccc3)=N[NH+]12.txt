Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+]1CCC2(CC1)Oc1ccc(Br)cc1C1CC(c3ccccc3)=N[NH+]12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains an amine group (-NH+) which is likely involved in binding to receptors that have amine-binding sites. This suggests potential interactions with genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 2: The molecule also has a benzene ring system, which could interact with enzymes involved in phase I metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2D6 and CYP2C19.
Step 3: The presence of a nitrophenyl group (-NO2) indicates potential interactions with enzymes involved in phase II metabolism, such as those encoded by SLC6A4, which encodes the norepinephrine transporter.
Step 4: The molecule includes a pyridine ring, which may interact with enzymes involved in DNA replication and repair, such as those encoded by CDK2.
Step 5: Given the molecular features, the related genes are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, SLC6A4, CDK2. 
Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, SLC6A4, CDK2.
