Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1[n-]cnc2[n-]ncc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule has a structure that includes a nitrile group (-CN) and multiple nitrogen-containing heterocycles, specifically pyrrole rings. This structure is indicative of a class of compounds known to interact with certain receptors and ion channels.
Step 2: Among the provided genes, several are involved in neurotransmitter systems and receptor signaling. These include HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which encode for various serotonin and dopamine receptors.
Step 3: The presence of nitrogen-containing heterocycles in the molecule suggests potential interactions with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), which also contain significant numbers of nitrogen atoms in their structures.
Step 4: The molecule's structure might also interact with voltage-gated potassium channels, indicated by KCNH2, given the presence of multiple nitrogen atoms that could form hydrogen bonds or participate in ion conduction.
Step 5: Considering the molecule's overall structure and potential interactions, the related genes are likely to be those involved in neurotransmission, receptor signaling, and ion channel function, including: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and KCNH2. Step 5: Summary of Related Genes: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, KCNH2.
