Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCC(=C(c1ccc([O-])cc1)c1ccc(OCC[NH+](C)C)cc1)c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this might be important.
Step 1: The molecule contains a complex structure with multiple rings and functional groups, including an aromatic ring system and a carboxylate group (-COOH). This complexity suggests it could interact with various biological targets.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylate group indicates potential acidity and the ability to form hydrogen bonds, which are common in ligands that interact with ion channels or receptors.
Step 3: The molecule's structure includes a pyrrolidine ring, which is characteristic of some G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) ligands. This feature may suggest interactions with receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), and dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4).
Step 4: The presence of a benzene ring and a nitro group could indicate a possible interaction with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4.
Step 5: Given the molecule's structure, it is likely to have interactions with genes involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and SIGMAR1.
