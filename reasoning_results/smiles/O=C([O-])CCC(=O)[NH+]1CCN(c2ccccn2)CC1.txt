Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])CCC(=O)[NH+]1CCN(c2ccccn2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that includes an amide group (C=O), a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH). These functional groups suggest the molecule may have pharmacological activity, particularly in affecting receptors or enzymes involved in signal transduction or metabolism.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of an amide and carboxylic acid suggests this molecule could interact with ion channels or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which often have binding sites for small molecules containing these functional groups. For example, the amide group could potentially bind to the intracellular loop or the cytoplasmic tail of GPCRs like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are involved in various physiological processes including neurotransmission and hormone signaling.
Step 3: The carboxylic acid group might also interact with ion channels such as KCNH2 (hERG potassium channel) and LCK (L-type calcium channel), which are known to be influenced by small molecules through direct binding or allosteric modulation. Additionally, the phenolic hydroxyl group could participate in hydrogen bonding interactions with proteins, potentially affecting enzymes or receptors involved in metabolic pathways.
Step 4: Considering the above interactions, the molecule could influence the activity of several genes encoding for receptors and ion channels, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, KCNH2, and LCK. It could also modulate the function of enzymes like CYP2C9 and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism, suggesting potential interactions with genes related to drug response and metabolism.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the molecule appears to be potentially related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, KCNH2, LCK, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These genes are involved in neurotransmission, hormone signaling, and drug metabolism, indicating the molecule's possible impact on these biological processes. 
List of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, KCNH2, LCK, CYP2C9, CYP2D6.
