Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc(-c2cn(C3CCc4c(F)cccc4N(CC(F)(F)F)C3=O)nn2)ccc1-n1cnc(C)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex molecule with multiple functional groups including a phenol (CO), an amine (-n1cnc(C)c1), and several heterocycles (e.g., pyrrole, furan). This structural complexity suggests the molecule could interact with proteins that have binding sites for aromatic rings, amine groups, and possibly heterocycles.
Step 2: The presence of a phenolic group (CO) and an amine (-n1cnc(C)c1) indicates potential for hydrogen bonding and π-π stacking interactions. These interactions are crucial for ligand-receptor binding and could be relevant to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other membrane proteins.
Step 3: Given the presence of an amine and aromatic rings, the molecule might interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism such as CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which typically bind to molecules with aromatic and hydrophobic moieties.
Step 4: The presence of a furan ring and possible N-heterocycles could indicate the molecule has affinity for ion channels or transporters, such as those encoded by SLC6A2 and SLC6A4, which are involved in neurotransmitter reuptake.
Step 5: Considering the structural features and potential interaction sites, the most likely related genes from the provided list include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and DRD2, DRD3, DRD4 (these are GPCRs that may interact with the molecule due to its aromatic and amine functionalities).
