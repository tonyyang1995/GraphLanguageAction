Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc2nc3oc(C(=O)[NH+]4CCN(c5cccc(C(F)(F)F)c5)CC4)cc3cc2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule likely to be an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which is encoded by the ABCB1 gene. This protein is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family and is involved in drug efflux from cells.
Step 2: The molecule contains a quinolone-like structure, which is often found in inhibitors of CYP enzymes, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These enzymes are involved in the metabolism of various drugs and xenobiotics, and their inhibition can affect pharmacokinetics.
Step 3: The presence of multiple aromatic rings and heteroatoms, such as oxygen and nitrogen, suggests that the molecule could interact with receptors or ion channels. For instance, it might target the adrenergic receptors ADRA1D, ADRA2B, and ADRB2, which are G-protein-coupled receptors involved in the regulation of heart rate and blood pressure.
Step 4: The molecule also has a benzodiazepine-like structure, which could potentially interact with the cannabinoid receptor CNR1, as well as the serotonin receptors HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C. These receptors are involved in various physiological processes, including mood regulation, pain perception, and neurotransmission.
Step 5: Given the complexity and potential for multiple interactions, this molecule is most likely related to the ABCB1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CNR1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C genes. These genes encode proteins involved in drug transport, metabolism, and signaling pathways. 
Summary of related genes: ABCB1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CNR1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C.
