Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])COCC[NH+]1CC[NH+](C(c2ccccc2)c2ccc(Cl)cc2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound with a benzene ring, an amide group, and multiple substituents including an ester group, a nitro group, and a cyano group. This structure suggests it could be a potential ligand for various receptors and enzymes due to its diverse functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of an amide and ester group indicates the molecule could interact with enzymes that metabolize drugs, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are involved in drug metabolism pathways. This interaction could affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the molecule.
Step 3: The nitro group and cyano group are known to potentially interact with ion channels and receptors, such as KCNH2 (hERG potassium channel) and HTR2A (serotonin receptor), which are involved in neuronal function and cardiovascular effects. This interaction could lead to side effects such as QT interval prolongation or serotonin syndrome.
Step 4: Given the complexity and diversity of the molecule, it is likely to have interactions with multiple targets, including receptors like DRD2 (dopamine receptor) and HTR2B (serotonin receptor), and enzymes like CYP2D6, which are involved in neurotransmitter metabolism and drug metabolism, respectively.
Step 5: The molecule's potential interactions with these targets suggest that it may be related to several genes, including those encoding enzymes involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and receptors involved in neurotransmission (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).

Note: The molecule does not appear to have a direct relationship with the other listed genes, such as those involved in cancer (e.g., ABL1, KDR, MCL1), inflammation (e.g., PTGS1), or other physiological processes (e.g., EGFR, ESR1). These genes are not highlighted as related based on the structural features described. However, further detailed studies would be required to confirm the exact interactions and biological relevance of the molecule with these genes.
