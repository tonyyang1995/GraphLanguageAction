Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a structure resembling a benzene ring system with a central double bond and an oxygen atom. This structure is similar to the ligand-binding pocket of certain G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are often involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-CONH-) suggests potential interaction with enzymes that metabolize drugs or neurotransmitters, such as CYP2D6, which is known to metabolize various substrates including some drugs and hormones.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a cyclic amine group, which could interact with ion channels or receptors that bind to small organic molecules, like CACNA1H, which codes for a voltage-gated calcium channel.
Step 4: The overall structure hints at possible interactions with receptors that modulate neurotransmitter activity, such as HTR2A and HTR2B, which code for serotonin receptors.
Step 5: Given the structural features, the molecule may be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, OPNK1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
