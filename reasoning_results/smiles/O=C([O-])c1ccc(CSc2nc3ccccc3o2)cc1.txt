Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])c1ccc(CSc2nc3ccccc3o2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a structure that includes an oxygen atom double-bonded to a carbon atom, which is further bonded to an oxygen negatively charged ion (O-). This indicates the presence of a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylate group (-COO-), which are functional groups often involved in interactions with various proteins and enzymes.
Step 2: The molecule also contains a benzene ring system, specifically a substituted benzene ring attached to a heterocyclic ring (cyclohexene), which is common in drug molecules due to its ability to form stable interactions with biological targets such as receptors and transporters.
Step 3: The cyclohexene ring system, along with the benzene rings, suggests potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are a class of transmembrane receptors that play a crucial role in signal transduction pathways and are associated with several genes like DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 4: The presence of aromatic substituents and the overall molecular structure hint at possible binding to cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 5: Given the molecular structure, the molecule may interact with multiple genes involved in neurotransmission and receptor signaling, including DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and also potentially with other genes related to GPCR function and signaling pathways.
