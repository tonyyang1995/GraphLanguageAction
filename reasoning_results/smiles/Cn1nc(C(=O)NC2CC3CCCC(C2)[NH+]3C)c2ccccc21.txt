Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cn1nc(C(=O)NC2CC3CCCC(C2)[NH+]3C)c2ccccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule with a complex structure including a benzene ring, amide, and multiple nitrogen-containing heterocycles. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes and receptors that have binding sites for similar functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of an amide (C(=O)N) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in the molecule indicates it could be an inhibitor or substrate for enzymes involved in metabolism and signaling pathways, such as those encoded by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: The nitrogen-containing heterocycles and the presence of aromatic rings suggest possible interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are involved in various signaling pathways. This could relate to genes like DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A), and CHRM1 (cholinergic receptor muscarinic M1).
Step 4: The molecule's structure also hints at potential modulation of ion channels, given the presence of aromatic systems that might interact with ion channel proteins. This could be relevant to genes encoding ion channels, such as KCNH2 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2).
Step 5: Based on the structural features and the potential interaction patterns, the related genes include: CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, CHRM1, and KCNH2.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- DRD2
- HTR2A
- CHRM1
- KCNH2 Step 1: The given SMILES string describes a complex molecule with functional groups like amides and carboxylic acids.
Step 2: These functional groups suggest the molecule could interact with enzymes like CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which metabolize drugs.
Step 3: The nitrogen-containing heterocycles and aromatic rings indicate potential binding to GPCRs such as DRD2, HTR2A, and CHRM1.
Step 4: The aromatic structure may also interact with ion channels like KCNH2.
Step 5: Therefore, the related genes are: CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, CHRM1, and KCNH2. 
- KCNH2
