Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(OCC(O)Cn2cnc3ccccc32)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure that includes a benzene ring system, an amide group, and a pyrrole ring fused to a benzene ring. The presence of these functional groups suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in neurotransmitter transport, metabolism, and receptor binding.
Step 2: The benzene ring system and the amide group indicate a possibility for interaction with enzymes such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) family members, which are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics. This suggests a potential relationship with CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
Step 3: The amide group and the pyrrole ring could also be involved in forming hydrogen bonds with receptors or transporters. This hints at possible interactions with genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 4: Given the presence of an amide group, which is often found in ligands for ion channels, there might be a potential interaction with KCNH2, a gene encoding a voltage-gated potassium channel.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and the presence of aromatic rings, there could be a possibility of interaction with enzymes involved in the metabolism of fatty acids and cholesterol, such as CYP3A4.
Summary of related gene names: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, an amide group, and a pyrrole ring fused to a benzene ring.
Step 2: These structural features suggest potential interactions with enzymes from the cytochrome P450 family, specifically CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
Step 3: The amide and pyrrole groups may form hydrogen bonds with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), including DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 4: The amide group could interact with ion channels, possibly involving KCNH2.
Step 5: The presence of aromatic rings suggests potential involvement with CYP3A4, which metabolizes fatty acids and cholesterol.
Summary of related gene names: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2. Step 1: The molecule has a benzene ring system and an amide group.
Step 2: This suggests potential interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes like CYP1A2
