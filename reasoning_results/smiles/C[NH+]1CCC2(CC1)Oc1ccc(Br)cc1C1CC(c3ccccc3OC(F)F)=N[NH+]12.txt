Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+]1CCC2(CC1)Oc1ccc(Br)cc1C1CC(c3ccccc3OC(F)F)=N[NH+]12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a quinolone-like structure, which is characterized by a six-membered nitrogen-containing heterocycle with an additional five-membered ring fused to it. This structural feature suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) and a substituted benzene ring in the molecule could indicate potential interactions with enzymes such as CYP2D6, which is known to metabolize drugs containing these functional groups.
Step 3: The molecule also has a pyridine ring, which may interact with receptors that contain similar functional groups, such as HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A), which is involved in neurotransmission.
Step 4: The overall size and shape of the molecule suggest it could potentially bind to large protein targets like G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as HTR2A and HTR2B.
Step 5: Based on the above structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes, including CYP2D6, HTR2A, and HTR2B, due to its potential to interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism and receptors involved in neurotransmission.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2D6
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
These genes are relevant due to the molecular structure's potential to interact with enzymes and receptors that they encode. The relationships are based on the presence of functional groups that are recognized by these proteins and the overall size and shape of the molecule that might allow it to bind to them. Other genes listed do not have a direct structural or functional connection to this particular molecule.
