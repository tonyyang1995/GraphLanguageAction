Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCNC(=O)c1nnsc1S(=O)(=O)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure featuring an amide group (-CONH-), a benzene ring, and a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH-). The presence of these functional groups suggests potential interactions with proteins that have similar chemical functionalities.
Step 2: Among the given genes, those involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmitter signaling are more likely to interact with the molecule due to their role in processing and responding to chemical signals. Specifically, the sulfonamide group could be relevant for enzymes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are involved in the metabolism of various drugs.
Step 3: The amide group might interact with receptors such as DRD2 (Dopamine Receptor D2) and HTR2A (Serotonin Receptor 2A), which are known to bind to various ligands including amides.
Step 4: The benzene ring structure could potentially interact with other aromatic amino acids or proteins, possibly affecting genes like PTGS1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase 1) or HRH1 (Histamine H1 Receptor).
Step 5: Given the chemical structure, the most likely related genes are those involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19) and neurotransmitter signaling (DRD2, HTR2A). Other genes such as PTGS1 and HRH1 may also have some relevance but less direct interaction based on the provided information.
