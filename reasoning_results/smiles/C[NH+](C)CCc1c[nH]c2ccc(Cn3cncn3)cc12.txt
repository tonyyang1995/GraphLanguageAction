Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with several functional groups, including a pyrrolidine ring, an amide group, and a phenyl ring. Notably, it contains a positively charged nitrogen atom (N+), which suggests it could act as a basic compound.
Step 2: Considering the presence of aromatic rings and the overall molecular shape, this molecule likely interacts with receptors or enzymes that have binding sites for similar structures. For example, the pattern might be recognized by proteins involved in G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathways, which are known to bind to various ligands with similar structural features.
Step 3: Among the listed genes, those involved in G-protein coupled receptor signaling and neurotransmitter systems are particularly relevant due to their ability to interact with molecules like this one. This includes genes encoding for various receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), cholinergic receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), and dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4).
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of the positively charged nitrogen suggests potential interactions with enzymes or transporters that handle basic compounds. Genes such as SLC6A2 and SLC6A4, which encode for monoamine transporters, could be related due to their function in handling charged molecules.
Step 5: Based on the structural and functional analysis, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, SLC6A2, SLC6A4. These genes are involved in neurotransmission and receptor signaling, which aligns well with the chemical nature of the provided molecule.
