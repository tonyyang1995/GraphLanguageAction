Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCn1cc(-c2ccnc3[nH]c(-c4cccc(C[NH+](C)C)c4)cc23)c(-c2ccc(NC(=O)[NH+](C)C)cc2)n1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule contains multiple functional groups such as amine (-NH2), imine (-N=C-), carboxamide (-CONH-), and ester (-COO-). These functional groups are characteristic of molecules that can interact with various proteins, particularly those involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction.
Step 2: Notably, the molecule has an amide group (-CONH-) which could potentially interact with receptors containing amine binding sites, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels. This suggests the molecule might have affinity for receptors that regulate neurotransmitter release or response.
Step 3: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule, along with the amine and imine functionalities, indicates potential interaction with enzymes like monoamine oxidases (MAOs) or cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, which are known to metabolize many drugs and neurotransmitters.
Step 4: Given the pattern of the molecule, it may also interact with GPCRs that bind neurotransmitters such as serotonin (5-HT), dopamine, or acetylcholine, based on its amine and carboxamide functionalities.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and functional groups, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes encoding for receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and metabolism, including: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and SLC6A4.
Summary of related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, SLC6A4.
