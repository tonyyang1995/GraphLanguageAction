Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COC(=O)c1ccc([O-])cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule with a benzene ring, an amide group (-CO-) attached to it, and an oxygen atom single-bonded to the ring. This structure is characteristic of a class of molecules known as benzodiazepine derivatives, which often interact with GABA receptors and other neurotransmitter systems.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group suggests the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those coded by CYP (Cytochrome P450) genes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize benzodiazepines and other drugs.
Step 3: Given the benzene ring and amide group, the molecule might also interact with ion channels or receptors that are influenced by GABAergic signaling, such as HTR2A (serotonin receptor), which is part of the serotonin system and could be modulated by this type of molecule.
Step 4: The molecule’s structure may also suggest interactions with adrenergic receptors, such as ADRA1D and ADRA2B, which are part of the sympathetic nervous system, due to the presence of a benzene ring and potential for binding to these receptors.
Step 5: Considering the above points, the related genes are likely to be involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6), neurotransmitter systems (HTR2A), and receptor modulation (ADRA1D, ADRA2B). 
Summary of Related Genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A, ADRA1D, ADRA2B.
