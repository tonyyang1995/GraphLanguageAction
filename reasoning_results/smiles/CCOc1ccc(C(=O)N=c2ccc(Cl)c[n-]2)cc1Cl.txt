Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOc1ccc(C(=O)N=c2ccc(Cl)c[n-]2)cc1Cl, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure containing a benzene ring (C6H6), a carbonyl group (C=O), a nitro group (NO2), and several substituents such as chlorine (Cl), methyl (CH3), and an amide (N-C=O). This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes that metabolize drugs, particularly those involved in phase I reactions like cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) and a nitro group (NO2) indicates that this molecule could be metabolized by enzymes like CYP2E1, which are part of the cytochrome P450 family. Among the provided genes, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are known to be involved in the metabolism of drugs containing similar functional groups.
Step 3: The amide group (N-C=O) and the presence of a nitrogen atom suggest that this molecule might interact with receptors or transport proteins that have amino acid residues capable of binding to such functional groups. Genes such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4 encode dopamine receptors, which are known to interact with various ligands, including those containing amide groups.
Step 4: The presence of a benzene ring and its substitution pattern indicate that this molecule could also interact with other drug targets such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Genes like HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C encode serotonin receptors, which often bind to molecules with aromatic rings and amine functionalities.
Step 5: Given the complexity of the molecule and its potential interactions with multiple classes of drug targets, it is likely that this molecule could influence the expression or function of several genes involved in drug metabolism and receptor binding. Based on the provided list, the related genes include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C.
