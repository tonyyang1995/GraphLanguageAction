Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc2c(OCc3nnc4ccc(-c5ccccc5)nn34)ccnc2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule, which includes multiple functional groups such as aromatic rings, hydroxyl (-OH), amine (-NH2), and a nitro group (-NO2). This structure suggests that the molecule could interact with proteins involved in various biological processes, including receptor binding and enzymatic activities.
Step 2: Among the listed genes, several are known to encode for receptors or enzymes that might interact with molecules containing aromatic rings and functional groups like -OH and -NH2. For instance, adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) have well-defined binding sites for ligands that include aromatic rings and hydroxyl groups.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a nitro group in the molecule could potentially interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 4: Furthermore, the molecule's structure may also interact with other receptors and enzymes such as cholinergic receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), cannabinoid receptor (CNR1), and GABA receptor subunit (CACNA1H).
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure described, the most likely related genes are those encoding for adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), cholinergic receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), and cannabinoid receptor (CNR1).
Summary of related gene names:
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- ADRB2
