Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C(=O)[O-])c1ccc(-c2ccccc2)c(F)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure including a benzene ring, an amide group, and a fluorine atom. The presence of these functional groups suggests that the molecule could be a drug-like compound with potential pharmacological activity.
Step 2: Among the provided genes, several are involved in drug metabolism and transport, such as CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4. These genes encode enzymes and transporters that interact directly with drugs to metabolize them or transport them across cell membranes.
Step 3: The molecule's amide group and aromatic structure indicate it may be a substrate for cytochrome P450 enzymes like those encoded by CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize many drugs through oxidation reactions.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a basic nitrogen (which could form a cationic moiety) and a hydrophobic benzene ring suggests the molecule might interact with transport proteins such as those encoded by SLC6A2 and SLC6A4, which are involved in neurotransmitter uptake.
Step 5: Therefore, the molecule is likely to be related to the genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and drug transporters (SLC6A2, SLC6A4).
