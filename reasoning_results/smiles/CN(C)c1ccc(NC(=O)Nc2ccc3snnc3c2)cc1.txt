Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CN(C)c1ccc(NC(=O)Nc2ccc3snnc3c2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups including a nitrogen-containing heterocycle, an amide group, and a nitrile moiety. These features suggest potential interactions with enzymes that metabolize drugs or modulate neurotransmitter activity.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of an amide group (NC(=O)N) indicates this molecule could be an inhibitor or activator of enzymes involved in drug metabolism such as CYP2C19 and CYP2D6. These enzymes are known to metabolize various drugs, and their activity can be influenced by inhibitors or inducers like the molecule described.
Step 3: The nitrile group (-CN) might interact with proteins containing metal ion binding sites or other specific functional groups, which could potentially affect enzymes like CYP3A4, known for its role in drug metabolism.
Step 4: Given the presence of a nitrogen atom within the heterocyclic ring and the amine group, the molecule could also interact with receptors or transporters involved in neurotransmission. This suggests possible interactions with genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as DRD2, HTR1A, and HTR2A, which are involved in dopamine and serotonin signaling pathways.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule's overall structure may allow it to interact with enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways, such as those encoded by genes like PTGS1 (which encodes COX-1, an enzyme involved in prostaglandin synthesis) and SIGMAR1 (sigma receptor), which could influence inflammation and pain modulation.
