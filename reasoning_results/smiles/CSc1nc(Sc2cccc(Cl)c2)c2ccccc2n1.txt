Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CSc1nc(Sc2cccc(Cl)c2)c2ccccc2n1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains multiple aromatic rings, which are common in ligands that interact with receptors and enzymes. This structural feature suggests potential interaction with genes encoding membrane receptors or metabolic enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a tricyclic structure (Sc2cccc(Cl)c2) indicates possible affinity for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly those involved in neurotransmission such as adrenergic and cholinergic receptors.
Step 3: The molecule's overall shape and functional groups may facilitate binding to enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize various drugs.
Step 4: Given the pattern of aromatic rings and potential interactions with GPCRs, the molecule might also show affinity for genes involved in neurotransmitter signaling pathways, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, and CHRM1.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6. Step 5: Related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
