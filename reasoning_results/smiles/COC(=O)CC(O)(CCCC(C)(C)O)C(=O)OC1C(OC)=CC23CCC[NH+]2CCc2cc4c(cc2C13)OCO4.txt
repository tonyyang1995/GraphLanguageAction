Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COC(=O)CC(O)(CCCC(C)(C)O)C(=O)OC1C(OC)=CC23CCC[NH+]2CCc2cc4c(cc2C13)OCO4, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this information may be useful.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with an amide group attached, which is a common feature in drugs that interact with receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), and dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4). These receptors are involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways.
Step 2: The molecule also has a phenolic hydroxyl group, which could interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), particularly those involved in phase I metabolism of xenobiotics and drugs. This interaction could affect drug efficacy and toxicity.
Step 3: The presence of a quinolone-like structure (as seen in the 8-membered ring) suggests potential interactions with enzymes like CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize many drugs, including those that might be substrates or inhibitors of this enzyme.
Step 4: The molecule includes a benzodiazepine-like structure, which could potentially interact with GABA-A receptors (SIGMAR1) or other G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are involved in serotonin signaling.
Step 5: Given the complexity and diverse functional groups, the molecule could have multiple points of interaction with various genes and proteins, but the primary focus should be on the receptors and enzymes mentioned above due to their direct involvement in pharmacological activities.
Summary of related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, SIGMAR1, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C.
