Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: c1ccc(CN=c2[n-]c(-c3cccnc3)nc3ccccc23)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule containing a benzene ring, a nitrogen atom double-bonded to a carbon (indicated by "CN"), and a nitrogen atom with a negative charge (-) attached to another benzene ring system. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins that bind to or modify nitrogen-containing compounds or aromatic rings.
Step 2: Analyzing the genes listed, those involved in neurotransmitter transport and metabolism are likely to have the most direct interaction with the described molecule. For example, CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) are known for metabolizing various drugs and xenobiotics, including those with aromatic structures and nitrogen functionalities.
Step 3: Genes encoding receptors for neurotransmitters and hormones may also be relevant. The molecule's aromatic nature and nitrogen could interact with receptors such as HTR (serotonin receptors), DRD (dopamine receptors), and HRH (histamine receptors).
Step 4: Additionally, genes involved in signal transduction pathways might be impacted, particularly those that include G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like CHRM (cholinergic receptors) and ADRA/ADRB (adrenergic receptors), which often bind to ligands with aromatic structures.
Step 5: Considering the molecule's structure and the potential interactions with the described genes, the related gene names are: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2.
