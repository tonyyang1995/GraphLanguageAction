Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1[n-]cnc2c1C(c1ccccc1)c1c(nc[n-]c1=O)O2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring with multiple substituents, including a nitrile group (-CN), an amide group (-CONH2), and several carbon chains. The presence of these functional groups suggests that the molecule may interact with proteins involved in signal transduction or metabolic pathways.
Step 2: Among the given genes, those involved in neurotransmitter systems, particularly serotonin and dopamine receptors, are likely to have a direct relationship with the molecule due to its potential to modulate signaling pathways. These include HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule’s structure might interact with enzymes responsible for drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in the biotransformation of various xenobiotics and endogenous compounds.
Step 4: Furthermore, the presence of a nitrile group and amide group could potentially influence genes related to ion channels, such as KCNH2, which encodes the hERG potassium channel, although this connection is less direct compared to the previous ones.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes are: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and KCNH2. 
Summary of Related Genes: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, KCNH2.
