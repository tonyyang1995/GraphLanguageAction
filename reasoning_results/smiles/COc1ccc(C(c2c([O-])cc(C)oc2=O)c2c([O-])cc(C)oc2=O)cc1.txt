Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(C(c2c([O-])cc(C)oc2=O)c2c([O-])cc(C)oc2=O)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound that includes multiple rings and functional groups such as carbonyl (C=O), ether (O-C), ester (C-O-C), and amide (C-N) functionalities. These structural elements suggest potential interactions with enzymes and receptors involved in drug metabolism and signaling pathways.
Step 2: Notably, the molecule contains two ester groups (-COO-) which are known to be substrates for CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 enzymes. These cytochrome P450 enzymes are involved in the metabolism of various drugs, including those that interact with receptors like adrenergic and dopaminergic systems.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of an aromatic ring system and possibly a quinone-like moiety could indicate activity against enzymes such as CYP1A2, which metabolizes a wide range of substrates including some that affect G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 4: The molecule’s structure also hints at possible interaction with receptors that bind ligands through hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions, such as those mediated by GPCRs, which are associated with several of the listed genes including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule appears to have potential interactions with multiple genes, particularly those encoding for enzymes involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19) and receptors that modulate neurotransmission and other signaling pathways (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Summary of related genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
