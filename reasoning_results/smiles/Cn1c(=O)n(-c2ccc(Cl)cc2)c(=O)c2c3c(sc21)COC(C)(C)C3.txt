Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cn1c(=O)n(-c2ccc(Cl)cc2)c(=O)c2c3c(sc21)COC(C)(C)C3, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings and functional groups including amide, carbonyl, and ester functionalities. Notably, it contains two amide groups (C(=O)n), indicating potential activity as a ligand for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or other proteins that interact with amide-containing molecules.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring (c2ccc(Cl)cc2) suggests the molecule could interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These cytochrome P450 enzymes are known to metabolize many drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: The molecule also includes an ester group (COC(C)(C)C3) which might indicate the ability to interact with GPCRs, particularly those associated with neurotransmitter signaling pathways. This is relevant to genes like HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and DRD2, which encode receptors for serotonin and dopamine respectively.
Step 4: Given the overall complexity and potential for interaction with multiple biological targets, the molecule could influence various signaling pathways involving genes such as PTGS1 (COX-2), which is involved in inflammation and pain, and SLC6A4, a sodium-dependent neurotransmitter transporter.
Step 5: Based on the structure and functional groups present in the molecule, the following genes are likely to be related: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, PTGS1, and SLC6A4.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- DRD2
- PTGS1
- SLC6A4 Step 5: Summary of related gene names:
- SLC6A4
These genes are related to the molecule due to its potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmitter signaling pathways.
