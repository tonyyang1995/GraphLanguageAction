Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(NC(=O)Cc2ccc(Cl)cc2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a core structure consisting of a nitrogen atom (N) double-bonded to an oxygen atom (O), which is part of a sulfoxide group (-S(=O)(=O)-). This sulfoxide group is attached to a benzene ring (c1ccc(...)) through a nitrogen atom that is also part of an amide group (NC(=O)). The presence of a benzene ring and a sulfoxide group suggests this molecule may interact with receptors or enzymes that have similar functional groups.
Step 2: The amide group (NC(=O)) is linked to another benzene ring (Cc2ccc(Cl)cc2), which contains a chlorine atom (Cl). This pattern indicates the molecule might be involved in interactions with proteins that contain amino acid residues that could form hydrogen bonds or other types of interactions with the amide and the chlorine.
Step 3: The molecule’s overall structure, particularly the presence of a benzene ring and functional groups like the amide and sulfoxide, suggests it could potentially interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or enzymes such as cytochrome P450s (CYP enzymes), which are known to metabolize drugs and other xenobiotics.
Step 4: Considering the potential for drug-like properties based on its chemical structure, the molecule could interact with genes encoding proteins involved in neurotransmitter signaling pathways, drug metabolism, and receptor activity. For instance, it might affect genes related to GPCR signaling pathways, which include HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 5: Additionally, given the presence of functional groups that can participate in various types of protein interactions, the molecule might also influence genes involved in metabolic pathways and drug transport, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, and ABCB1.
