Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCC12C=CC[NH+]3CCC4(c5cc(Br)c(OC)cc5[NH+](C)C4C(O)(C(=O)OC)C1OC(C)=O)C32, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains multiple aromatic rings and a quaternary ammonium group. This suggests potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for aromatic compounds and positively charged groups.
Step 2: The presence of a quaternary ammonium group (NH+) and an ester group (C(O)(C(=O)OC)) indicates the molecule could interact with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize similar functional groups.
Step 3: The molecule's structure includes a benzene ring and a carboxylic acid group, which are common in drugs targeting G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are associated with several genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
Step 4: The presence of a bromine atom and a cyclohexane ring might suggest interactions with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, such as HRH1 and HTR2A, which are related to serotonin receptors.
Step 5: The overall structure and functional groups suggest the molecule may interact with a variety of proteins including those encoded by CYP3A4, PTGS1, and SLC6A4, which are involved in drug metabolism and transport.
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HRH1, HTR2A, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, PTGS1, SLC6A4.
