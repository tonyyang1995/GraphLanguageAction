Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(CC[NH+](C)CCCC(C#N)(c2cc(OC)c(OC)c(OC)c2)C(C)C)cc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple functional groups such as amine, carbonyl, and aromatic rings. It also includes a quinoline ring, which is characteristic of several drugs and natural products. This suggests the molecule could have diverse pharmacological activities.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (NH+) and a pyrrolidine ring, along with the quinoline ring, indicates potential interactions with receptors that contain similar functional groups. These include G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other membrane proteins that are often targeted by pharmaceuticals.
Step 3: Given the presence of a quinoline ring and the overall structure, this molecule might interact with GPCRs like DRD2 (Dopamine D2 receptor), HTR1A (Serotonin 5-HT1A receptor), HTR2A (Serotonin 5-HT2A receptor), and HRH1 (Histamine H1 receptor). These receptors are known to bind molecules with similar structural features.
Step 4: The molecule's complexity and specific functional groups suggest it could modulate enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize various drugs.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions with receptors and enzymes, the related genes would likely be those encoding for GPCRs (DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HRH1) and enzymes involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HRH1
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4 Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions with receptors and enzymes, the related genes would likely be those encoding for GPCRs (DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HRH1) and enzymes involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
- CYP3A4
These genes are the most likely candidates for being directly or indirectly influenced by the given molecule due to its chemical structure and potential pharmacological activities.
