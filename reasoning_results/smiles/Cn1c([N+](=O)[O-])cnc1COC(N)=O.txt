Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cn1c([N+](=O)[O-])cnc1COC(N)=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure that includes an amide group (-CONH), a phenyl ring, and a nitro group (-NO2). This structure suggests the molecule could be a small organic compound or drug-like molecule.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (N+) and an oxygen atom with a negative charge (O-) indicates the molecule likely contains an amine salt or ester functional group, which are common in many drugs and can interact with various receptors.
Step 3: Given the molecule’s structure, it might interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to its potential to fit into receptor binding sites. GPCRs are involved in signaling pathways and are targets for numerous drugs.
Step 4: Among the provided genes, those coding for GPCRs, such as DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, are likely candidates for interaction with this molecule because of their role in neurotransmitter signaling and their known ligand-binding properties.
Step 5: Additionally, genes encoding enzymes like CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs, could also be relevant if the molecule is intended to be a drug or if it interacts with metabolic pathways.
Summary of related gene names: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2D6, CYP2C19.
