Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+]1CCC(c2c[nH]c3ccc([O-])cc23)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom that is positively charged (N+), which suggests it could interact with negatively charged sites on proteins such as ion channels or receptors. This positive charge may allow the molecule to bind to and modulate the activity of certain genes' protein products.
Step 2: The molecule also has an aromatic ring system and a benzene ring, which are common structural elements in many drugs and small molecules that can interact with proteins involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction pathways.
Step 3: The presence of a phenolic group (-OH) attached to the aromatic ring indicates potential for binding to enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYPs), which are encoded by several of the listed genes such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2C9. These enzymes play a crucial role in drug metabolism.
Step 4: Given the overall structure and functional groups present, this molecule might interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels, which are encoded by genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and HRH1. These receptors and channels are involved in neurotransmission and other signaling pathways.
Step 5: The molecule's structure also hints at possible interactions with enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of neurotransmitters, such as CYP2D6, which is known to metabolize dopamine.
