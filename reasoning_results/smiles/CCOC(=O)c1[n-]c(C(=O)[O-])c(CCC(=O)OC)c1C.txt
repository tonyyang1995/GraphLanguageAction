Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)c1[n-]c(C(=O)[O-])c(CCC(=O)OC)c1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple functional groups including an amide (C=O), ester (C-O-C), and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle. These structural elements suggest the molecule could interact with proteins that have similar functional groups for binding or catalysis.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (likely a pyrrolidine ring) and a carboxamide group (C=O-NH) indicates potential interaction with receptors or enzymes that recognize such functional groups. This structure is common in molecules that bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or other membrane-bound proteins.
Step 3: Given the presence of an amide group and a carboxylate group, the molecule might also interact with enzymes involved in metabolic pathways, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize drugs and xenobiotics through oxidation reactions involving these functional groups.
Step 4: The molecule's structure does not directly suggest strong interactions with neurotransmitter receptors or transporters, which would be more likely if it had more aromatic rings or specific side chains that mimic neurotransmitters. However, its ability to form hydrogen bonds due to the amide and carboxylate groups might allow it to interact with proteins that have hydrophobic binding pockets.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the most likely genes related to this molecule are those involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6) and possibly those encoding receptors or channels that could interact with the molecule through its functional groups.
Summary of Related Genes:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6 To further investigate the exact mechanism of action and specificity, additional functional assays or computational modeling would be necessary. Step 1: The molecule contains a central carbon atom with various substituents, including an amide (C=O-NH), an ester (C-O-C), and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins that have complementary binding sites.
Step 2: The amide and ester functionalities indicate possible interactions with enzymes involved in metabolic processes, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize compounds with similar functional groups.
Step 3: The presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocycle and the overall structure imply that the molecule could potentially interact with ion channels or receptors, particularly those involved in neurotransmission or signaling pathways.
Step 4: Specific genes like HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C encode serotonin receptors, which might interact with the molecule due to its amide and carboxylate groups that could form hydrogen bonds or other interactions.
Step 5: The structure also suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism and signaling pathways, making genes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2) relevant.
