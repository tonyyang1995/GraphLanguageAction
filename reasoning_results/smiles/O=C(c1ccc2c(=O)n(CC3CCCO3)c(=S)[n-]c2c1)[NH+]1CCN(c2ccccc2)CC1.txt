Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(c1ccc2c(=O)n(CC3CCCO3)c(=S)[n-]c2c1)[NH+]1CCN(c2ccccc2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple functional groups such as carbonyl (C=O), amide (-CONH-), sulfoxide (S=O), aromatic rings, and amino (-NH+) groups. This structure suggests that the molecule could interact with proteins that have binding sites for these functional groups.
Step 2: Among the provided genes, several are involved in neurotransmitter systems and receptor pathways, which are known to interact with molecules containing amino and aromatic structures. These include HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4. The presence of an amino group (-NH+) in the molecule aligns well with the need for binding to receptors like those listed, which often have positively charged regions to bind to negatively charged amino groups.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a sulfoxide group (S=O) and aromatic rings, which might be relevant for interactions with enzymes and transporters. Genes related to these functions include CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics. The presence of a carbonyl and amide group in the molecule also suggests potential interaction with enzymes such as kinases or hydrolases, for which CDK2 and LCK (a tyrosine kinase) are relevant.
Step 4: The presence of a benzene ring in the molecule, as seen in the part of the structure labeled as CCN(c2ccccc2), may suggest a possible interaction with genes encoding ion channels or receptors that have benzene ring-containing ligands. For instance, KCNH2 encodes a potassium channel subunit that interacts with benzene-containing compounds.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names based on the molecule’s structural features, the genes potentially associated with this molecule are: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and KCNH2.
