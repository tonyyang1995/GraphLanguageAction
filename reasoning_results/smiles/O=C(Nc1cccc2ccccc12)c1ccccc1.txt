Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Nc1cccc2ccccc12)c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that contains a benzene ring with a nitrile group (-CN) and a carbonyl group (C=O). This structure suggests the molecule could be an acrylamide derivative or a similar compound. The presence of a nitrile and a carbonyl group indicates potential for interaction with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes.
Step 2: Among the provided genes, several are associated with drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics. Specifically, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 are all enzymes of the cytochrome P450 family that metabolize various drugs, including those with structures similar to the given molecule. The presence of a nitrile and a carbonyl group in the molecule suggests it might be metabolized by these enzymes.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule’s structure includes a benzene ring, which is a common feature in many drugs and can interact with various receptors and transport proteins. Genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C encode receptors for adrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmitters. These receptors are known to interact with molecules containing aromatic rings like benzene.
Step 4: Furthermore, the presence of a benzene ring also suggests possible interactions with ion channels. For example, CACNA1H encodes a calcium channel protein that may interact with molecules containing benzene rings due to their hydrophobic nature.
Step 5: Based on the structural features of the molecule and the gene functions described, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and CACNA1H.
Summary of related genes:
- CYP1A2
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- ADRB2
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- CACNA1H Step 5: Summary of related genes:
- CACNA1H
These genes are relevant due to the molecule's structural features, particularly the presence of a benzene ring and functional groups that can interact with enzyme systems and receptor proteins. The relationships are based on the molecular structure and the known functions of the genes involved in drug metabolism and receptor binding.
