Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(CC(=O)N=c2[n-]c3ccccc3s2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a carboxamide group (-CONH-) attached, which is part of a larger heterocyclic structure. This pattern suggests that the molecule could interact with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C19 and CYP2D6.
Step 2: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in the molecule indicates it may have effects on receptors or ion channels. This feature is relevant to genes like DRD2, which encodes dopamine receptor D2, and HTR2A, which codes for serotonin 5-HT2A receptor.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a sulfur atom in a thioether group (-S-), which might influence interactions with proteins containing cysteine residues, potentially affecting genes like KCNH2, which encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel.
Step 4: Given the complex structure involving multiple rings and functional groups, the molecule could also modulate signaling pathways through various receptors and enzymes. This suggests possible interactions with genes such as EGFR, which encodes epidermal growth factor receptor, and PTGS1, which codes for cyclooxygenase-1.
Step 5: Considering the diverse structural elements, the molecule might interact with a variety of targets, including but not limited to those encoded by genes like CYP3A4, CYP1A2, and SLC6A4, which are involved in drug metabolism and transport.
Summary of related gene names:

Note: The remaining genes listed do not appear to have a direct structural or functional relationship with the given molecule based on the provided information. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a carboxamide group (-CONH-) attached, suggesting potential interaction with enzymes involved in metabolism, particularly CYP2C19 and CYP2D6.
Step 2: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) indicates the molecule might affect receptors or ion channels, which could relate to genes like DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2) and HTR2A (serotonin 5-HT2A receptor).
Step 3: The thioether group (-S-) in the molecule suggests potential interactions with proteins containing cysteine residues, possibly impacting genes such as KCNH2 (potassium channel subfamily H member 2).
Step 4: The complex structure with multiple rings and functional groups implies the molecule could modulate signaling pathways, potentially interacting with genes like EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) and PTGS1 (cyclooxygenase-1).
Step 5: Given the diverse structural elements, the molecule might also interact with other metabolic enzymes and transporters, such as CYP3A4 and SLC6A4.
