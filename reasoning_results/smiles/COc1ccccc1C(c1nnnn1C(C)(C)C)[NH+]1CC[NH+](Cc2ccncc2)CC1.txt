Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccccc1C(c1nnnn1C(C)(C)C)[NH+]1CC[NH+](Cc2ccncc2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure featuring a benzene ring with multiple substituents, including a pyrrole ring, an amide group, and a quaternary ammonium salt. These features suggest potential interactions with proteins that have similar chemical motifs or binding sites.
Step 2: The presence of the quaternary ammonium salt (quaternary nitrogen) indicates that the molecule could be an agonist or antagonist for receptors that bind such groups, such as muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4). This is due to the similarity in charge distribution and hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties.
Step 3: The aromatic ring system with substituents also suggests potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which often bind to ligands with planar aromatic structures. Therefore, this molecule might interact with GPCRs like DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, all of which are involved in neurotransmission.
Step 4: Considering the presence of a benzene ring and other functional groups, the molecule may also interact with enzymes such as CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs and xenobiotics. This interaction could affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the molecule.
Step 5: Given the complexity of the molecule and its potential to interact with various receptors and enzymes, it is likely that the molecule could influence signaling pathways associated with these targets. For example, it might modulate neurotransmitter systems through GPCRs or alter drug metabolism via CYP enzymes, indirectly affecting genes like PTGS1 (COX-2), which is downstream of some of these pathways.
