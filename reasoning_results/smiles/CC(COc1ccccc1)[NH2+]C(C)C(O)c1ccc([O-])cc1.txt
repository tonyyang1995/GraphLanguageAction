Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(COc1ccccc1)[NH2+]C(C)C(O)c1ccc([O-])cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with an oxygen atom attached (CO), which suggests it could be a drug-like compound that interacts with proteins such as receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom with a positive charge ([NH2+]) indicates the molecule has basic properties, which may allow it to interact with acidic sites on proteins or nucleic acids.
Step 3: The molecule also includes an amide group (-CONH2), which can form hydrogen bonds and can act as a ligand for various protein targets.
Step 4: Considering the molecular structure, this compound might have potential interactions with proteins involved in neurotransmission, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or enzymes like CYPs (cytochrome P450) due to its functional groups.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and functional groups, the molecule is likely to interact with genes encoding for enzymes and receptors involved in neurotransmission and metabolism, including CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, and SLC6A4.
