Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(CSC1=[NH+]CCN1)Nc1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a carbonyl group (O=C), a thiocyanate group (SCN), an amide group (-CONH), and aromatic rings (c1cccc1). This structure suggests the molecule could be a drug-like entity with potential biological activity.
Step 2: The presence of a thiocyanate group (-SCN) and amide group (-CONH) indicates the molecule might interact with enzymes or receptors that recognize such functional groups. Thiocyanate groups are often found in compounds that inhibit certain enzymes, while amides can act as ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: Given the pattern of aromatic rings and the potential for enzyme inhibition, this molecule could interact with genes encoding enzymes involved in drug metabolism or signaling pathways. Specifically, it may target enzymes like CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize various drugs and have roles in neurotransmitter metabolism.
Step 4: Considering the possible interaction with GPCRs due to the amide group, this molecule might also affect genes associated with GPCR signaling, including HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and DRD2, which encode serotonin receptors and dopamine receptors, respectively.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related genes include: CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and DRD2. These genes play crucial roles in drug metabolism and neurotransmission. 
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- HTR6
- DRD2 Step 5: Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2
These genes are likely to be influenced by the molecule due to its structural features and potential interactions with enzymes and receptors.
