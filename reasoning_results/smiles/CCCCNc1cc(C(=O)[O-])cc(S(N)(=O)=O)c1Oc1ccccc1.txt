Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCNc1cc(C(=O)[O-])cc(S(N)(=O)=O)c1Oc1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with multiple functional groups, including an amide group (-CONH2), a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and several aromatic rings. These features suggest the molecule may have pharmacological activity, particularly as an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylate group (-COO-) and a nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring, likely involved in an amide bond, indicates that this molecule could potentially interact with enzymes such as CYP (Cytochrome P450) isozymes, which are known to metabolize drugs and other xenobiotics. This suggests a possible relationship with CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4.
Step 3: The aromatic nature of the molecule, with benzene rings, could also indicate potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are often targets for small molecules due to their role in signal transduction pathways. The molecule's structure might align well with binding sites of receptors like DRD2 (Dopamine D2 receptor) and HTR2A (Serotonin 5-HT2A receptor).
Step 4: Given the presence of a carboxylate group and a potential interaction with GPCRs, it is reasonable to consider that the molecule might also interact with ion channels. For example, the structure could potentially bind to KCNH2 (Voltage-gated potassium channel subfamily H member 2), which is involved in cardiac repolarization.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the most likely related genes are those involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP3A4) and neurotransmitter signaling (DRD2, HTR2A, KCNH2). Other genes listed do not appear to have a direct relationship with the molecule's structure or properties.
