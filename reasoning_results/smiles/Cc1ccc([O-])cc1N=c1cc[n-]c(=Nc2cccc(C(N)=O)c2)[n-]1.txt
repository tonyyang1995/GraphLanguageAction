Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc([O-])cc1N=c1cc[n-]c(=Nc2cccc(C(N)=O)c2)[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring system, specifically a pyrrole and a piperidine ring, which are common in ligands that interact with receptors such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature suggests potential interactions with genes encoding GPCRs.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-CONH-) and a carboxylate group (-COOH) indicates the molecule could be a small molecule inhibitor or activator of enzymes, particularly those involved in signal transduction pathways. This points towards genes like CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are involved in drug metabolism and enzyme activity.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a nitrile group (-CN), which is often found in molecules that act as inhibitors of enzymes such as deacetylases, which are involved in various cellular processes including inflammation and stress responses. This feature suggests possible interactions with genes like PTGS1, which encodes the COX-2 enzyme, and HRH1, which encodes the histamine H1 receptor.
Step 4: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in the molecule might indicate it has potential as an inhibitor of enzymes like nitric oxide synthase (NOS), which is encoded by genes such as NOS1, NOS2, and NOS3. However, since these genes are not listed, we focus on the other potential interactions.
Step 5: Given the presence of a guanidino group (-NH-C(-)N) and the overall structure, this molecule may have affinity for proteins that contain guanidino groups, such as ion channels and transporters. This could potentially interact with genes like SLC6A2 and SLC6A4, which encode neurotransmitter transporters.
