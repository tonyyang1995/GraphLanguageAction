Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C=CCn1c(=NC(C)c2cc(Cl)ccc2[O-])[n-]c2ccccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that includes aromatic rings, heteroatoms (such as nitrogen and oxygen), and a nitro group (-NO2). The presence of these structural elements suggests the molecule could interact with proteins involved in various biological processes.
Step 2: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring system, which is characteristic of several neurotransmitter receptors and enzymes. For example, pyrrole-containing molecules are known to bind to adrenergic and cholinergic receptors, which are associated with the genes ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 3: The presence of a nitrile group (-CN) and a nitro group (-NO2) indicates potential for interaction with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs), which are involved in drug metabolism. This suggests a possible relationship with genes such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
Step 4: The molecule also features an amide group, which can form hydrogen bonds and interact with proteins like G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This could relate to genes encoding GPCRs such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are involved in serotonin signaling.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and functional groups, the molecule could be related to multiple genes involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways. The related gene names include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
