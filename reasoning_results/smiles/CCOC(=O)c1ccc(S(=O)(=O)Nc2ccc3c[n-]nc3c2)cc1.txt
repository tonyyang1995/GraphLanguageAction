Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)c1ccc(S(=O)(=O)Nc2ccc3c[n-]nc3c2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with a central benzene ring (CC) attached to an oxygen-containing group (O), a carboxylic acid group (C(=O)c1ccc), a sulfur-containing group (S(=O)(=O)N), and a nitrogen atom with a negative charge ([n-]). This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes and receptors that are involved in signal transduction and metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (C(=O)c1ccc) and a sulfonamide (S(=O)(=O)N) indicates that the molecule could interact with enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics. These enzymes are responsible for oxidizing, reducing, and hydrolyzing substrates.
Step 3: The nitrogen atom with a negative charge ([n-]) may participate in hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions with proteins, particularly those containing positively charged residues. This feature is relevant to receptors such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are part of the serotonin receptor family and play a role in neurotransmission.
Step 4: The benzene ring and its substituents might also influence the molecule's ability to interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, and HRH1 are known to bind to ligands with aromatic moieties and functional groups that can form hydrogen bonds.
Step 5: Given the structural features described, the molecule could potentially interact with the following genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, and HRH1. These genes encode enzymes and receptors that are involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmission, and signaling pathways. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring, carboxylic acid, and a sulfonamide group.
Step 2: The carboxylic acid and sulfonamide groups suggest potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism.
Step 3: The nitrogen with a negative charge indicates possible interactions with receptors that have positively charged binding sites.
Step 4: The benzene ring and its substituents may allow for interactions with G-protein coupled receptors.
Step 5: The related genes are: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, and HRH1.
