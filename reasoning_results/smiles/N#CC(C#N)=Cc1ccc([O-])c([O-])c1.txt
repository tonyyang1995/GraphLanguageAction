Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N#CC(C#N)=Cc1ccc([O-])c([O-])c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom triple-bonded to carbon (N#C) and multiple aromatic rings, suggesting it may interact with receptors or enzymes that bind to or are activated by aromatic compounds or nitrogen-containing heterocycles.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) and a ketone group (C=O) indicates potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as CYP enzymes, which are known to metabolize compounds containing these functional groups.
Step 3: The molecule also has negatively charged oxygen atoms (-O-), which could interact with positively charged residues in receptor proteins or ion channels, potentially affecting their function.
Step 4: Given the molecular structure and functional groups, this compound might interact with genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4, as well as enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 5: The related gene names are: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6. Summary: These genes encode receptors and enzymes that could be directly affected by the molecule's structure and chemical properties. Step 5: List of related genes: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6.
