Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(N=c1[n-]nc(COc2ccccc2)s1)c1cccs1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule, which appears to be a derivative of benzene with multiple functional groups such as nitriles, amides, and sulfonamides. The presence of these functional groups suggests that the molecule could potentially interact with various biological targets through different mechanisms.
Step 2: Analyzing the structure further, the molecule contains a nitrile group (-CN) and a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), which are known to form hydrogen bonds and can participate in enzyme inhibition. This structural feature may allow the molecule to interact with enzymes encoded by certain genes, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule's structure includes an amide group (-CONH), which can act as a ligand for receptors. This functionality might enable the molecule to bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are involved in neurotransmission and play crucial roles in various physiological processes including pain perception, reward, and mood regulation.
Step 4: Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, the molecule might also interact with ion channels and transporters. For example, it could affect calcium channels (e.g., CACNA1H) or adrenergic receptors (e.g., ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2). These interactions could influence cellular signaling pathways and ion fluxes.
Step 5: Considering the above points, the molecule may be related to several genes associated with drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6), neurotransmission (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), and ion channel function (CACNA1H, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2).
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- DRD2
- DRD3
- DRD4
- CACNA1H
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- ADRB2
These genes are primarily involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmission, and ion channel function, which aligns with the molecular features of the described compound. However, it's important to note that this analysis is based on the molecule's structure and does not account for other factors such as the actual biological activity or potential off-target effects. Further experimental validation would be necessary to confirm any specific interactions.
