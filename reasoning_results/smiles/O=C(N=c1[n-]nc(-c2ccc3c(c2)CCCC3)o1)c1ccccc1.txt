Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(N=c1[n-]nc(-c2ccc3c(c2)CCCC3)o1)c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with multiple substitutions, including a nitro group, a cyano group, and alkyl chains. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of cyano and nitro groups may indicate involvement with genes encoding for cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP), such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize compounds containing these functional groups.
Step 3: The alkyl chain and overall aromatic nature of the molecule might also interact with genes associated with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, due to their binding affinity for ligands with similar structures.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's potential for affecting ion channels, indicated by its aromatic rings and substituents, could relate to genes like KCNH2, which encodes the hERG potassium channel.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the potential targets include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, KCNH2. Step 5: Summary of Related Gene Names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, KCNH2.
