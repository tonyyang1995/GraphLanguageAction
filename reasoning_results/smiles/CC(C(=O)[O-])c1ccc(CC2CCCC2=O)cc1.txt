Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C(=O)[O-])c1ccc(CC2CCCC2=O)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure containing an acetyl group (C(=O)[O-]), a benzene ring (CC), and a quinoline-like structure (c1ccc(CC2CCCC2=O)cc1). This suggests the molecule could interact with enzymes or receptors that are involved in metabolism or signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of a benzene ring and an acetyl group might indicate the molecule could be a substrate for enzymes such as CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: The quinoline-like structure (c1ccc(CC2CCCC2=O)cc1) is reminiscent of molecules that could interact with receptors such as DRD2, DRD3, or DRD4, which are dopamine receptors, or HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, or HTR6, which are serotonin receptors.
Step 4: Given the complexity of the molecule, it could also potentially interact with enzymes like PTGS1, which is involved in prostaglandin synthesis, or with kinases such as LCK or HRH1.
Step 5: Therefore, the related genes to this molecule are likely to be: CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, PTGS1, LCK, HRH1. Summary: The related gene names are CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, PTGS1, LCK, HRH1.
