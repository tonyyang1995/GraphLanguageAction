Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)Oc1ccc(-c2cnc3c(-c4ccnc5ccccc45)cnn3c2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that includes a benzene ring system, a pyrrole ring, and a hydroxyl group (-OH). This structure suggests the molecule could be a small molecule ligand or drug candidate.
Step 2: Analyzing the pattern of the molecule, it contains functional groups like amine (-NH2), carboxyl (-COOH), and aromatic rings which are common in molecules that interact with receptors or enzymes. These functional groups can potentially form hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions, and π-π stacking with proteins.
Step 3: Considering the molecular structure, it is likely to interact with receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmission, signal transduction, and other physiological processes. Genes such as DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), HTR1A (Serotonin receptor 1A), and HRH1 (Histamine receptor H1) encode proteins that fit this description.
Step 4: The presence of an aromatic ring and hydroxyl group also indicates potential interaction with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes are: DRD2, HTR1A, HRH1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4.
Summary of Related Gene Names:
- DRD2
