Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(-c2cc(=O)c3c(OC)c(OC)c(OC)cc3o2)cc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule in question is a complex organic compound that includes a benzene ring system, a carbonyl group, and several hydroxyl groups. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes and receptors involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction.
Step 2: The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups indicates the molecule could be an inhibitor or substrate for enzymes involved in phase I metabolism, such as CYP (cytochrome P450) enzymes. Specifically, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are known to metabolize drugs with similar functional groups, suggesting a possible interaction with these enzymes.
Step 3: The benzene ring and carbonyl group are also characteristic of molecules that might interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are encoded by genes like DRD2, HTR2A, and HTR2B. These receptors play crucial roles in neurotransmission and are often targets for psychiatric medications.
Step 4: Given the complexity of the molecule, it could potentially interact with multiple targets, including ion channels and kinases. For instance, the structure might mimic endogenous ligands for GPCRs, affecting their function, or it could directly bind to and modulate the activity of ion channels like KCNH2.
Step 5: Considering the potential for metabolic interactions and receptor modulation, the related genes include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, and KCNH2.
