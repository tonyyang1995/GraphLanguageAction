Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)OC(=O)C(C)(C)Oc1ccc(C(=O)c2ccc(Cl)cc2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure including a benzene ring, an ester group (-COO-), and multiple alkyl chains. This suggests it could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction or enzymatic activities.
Step 2: The presence of an ester group indicates potential activity as a drug that might modulate enzyme activity or receptor binding. This aligns with genes involved in metabolic pathways and neurotransmitter systems.
Step 3: The alkyl chain and benzene ring suggest hydrophobic interactions, which could be relevant for membrane-bound receptors or transporters. Genes like CYP enzymes and DRD receptors might be influenced by such structural features.
Step 4: Given the potential for interaction with receptors and enzymes, genes like CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, and HTR2A (serotonin receptors) are likely candidates due to their roles in metabolism and neurotransmission.
Step 5: Considering the broad impact on metabolic pathways and neurotransmitter systems, additional genes like PTGS1 (involved in inflammation) and SLC6A4 (serotonin transporter) may also be relevant.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, HTR2A, PTGS1, SLC6A4.
