Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(NC(=O)Cc2ccccc2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples.
Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule with a core structure that includes a nitrogen atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom (N=O), which is characteristic of a nitrile oxide group. This structural feature is commonly found in molecules that are substrates for CYP enzymes, particularly CYP2C19 and CYP2C9, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics.
Step 2: The molecule also contains a benzene ring attached to the nitrile oxide group, which is a common pharmacophore in many drug-like molecules. Benzene rings are often involved in interactions with receptors such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Among the listed genes, several are known to encode GPCRs, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule features a pyrrolidine ring fused to the benzene ring, which can form hydrogen bonds with certain protein pockets. This structural element could potentially interact with kinases, such as CDK2 and LCK, which are encoded by the CDK2 and LCK genes, respectively.
Step 4: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH2) in the molecule suggests potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for amide groups, such as ion channels and transporters. The SLC6A2 and SLC6A4 genes encode neurotransmitter transporters, which could be targets for this molecule due to their amide-containing binding sites.
Step 5: The overall structure of the molecule, with its nitrile oxide, benzene, and carboxamide groups, indicates that it might interact with multiple classes of proteins, including GPCRs, kinases, and transporters. Therefore, the related genes include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CDK2, LCK, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4. 
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CDK2, LCK, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
