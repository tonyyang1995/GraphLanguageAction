Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(NS(=O)(=O)c2ccc(NC(=O)c3cccc(NC(=O)C(C)C)c3)cc2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex molecule with multiple functional groups such as amides, esters, and a nitro group. This structure suggests that the molecule could potentially interact with enzymes or receptors involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of an ester (NS(=O)(=O)) and amide (-NC(=O)-) groups indicates that this molecule could be an inhibitor or activator of enzymes that metabolize drugs, such as CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are known to be involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: Given the presence of a nitro group and amide functionalities, the molecule might also interact with receptors that are involved in neurotransmission, such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) involved in serotonin signaling.
Step 4: Additionally, the complex structure with multiple functional groups suggests potential interactions with kinases, such as LCK and KDR, which are tyrosine kinases involved in various cellular processes including cell growth and differentiation.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions with enzymes and receptors, the related genes include: CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, LCK, KDR.
