Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(N=c1[n-]cc(Cc2ccccc2Cl)s1)c1cccs1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with a core structure consisting of a benzene ring fused to a pyrrole ring, which is further connected to a pyridine ring and a naphthalene ring. Additionally, there are substituents such as a cyano group (-CN), a nitroso group (N-), a chlorine atom (Cl), and a methyl group (CH3). This structure suggests that the molecule may be a derivative of a known class of compounds, such as arylpyrazoles or arylpyrimidines, which often interact with various receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: Analyzing the substituents, the presence of a nitroso group (N-) and a cyano group (-CN) indicates potential for interaction with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs), specifically CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. These enzymes are involved in the metabolism of many drugs and xenobiotics, and the presence of these functional groups might suggest that the molecule could be metabolized by these enzymes, leading to changes in its pharmacological activity.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a quinolone-like structure, which is characteristic of compounds that can interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Given this, it is possible that the molecule could interact with receptors such as HTR2A (serotonin 5-HT2A receptor), which is associated with several genes like HTR2A itself and other related receptors like HTR2B and HTR2C. These interactions could influence neurotransmission and potentially affect behaviors related to mood, cognition, and pain perception.
Step 4: Furthermore, the presence of a quinolone-like structure and the overall molecular profile suggest that the molecule might also interact with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). This is indicated by the presence of substituents that can form hydrogen bonds and stabilize the binding site of these receptors. Therefore, the molecule might interact with CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4, which are part of the cholinergic system and play roles in muscle contraction, learning, memory, and neuromodulation.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and the potential interactions described above, the molecule is likely to have effects mediated through the action on CYP enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP2C19), serotonin receptors (HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C), and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- CHRM1
- CHRM3
- CHRM4 Step 5: Based on the detailed analysis of the molecule's structure and potential interactions, the related genes can be summarized as follows:
- CHRM4
These genes are involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmission, and neuromodulation, highlighting the molecule's potential impact on these biological processes.
