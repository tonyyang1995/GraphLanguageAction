Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system and a pyrrole ring, which are characteristic structural elements that can be associated with various pharmacological activities.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) and a nitrile group (-NC) suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). These enzymes are known to metabolize drugs and modulate their efficacy and toxicity.
Step 3: The molecule also has a quinolone-like structure, which could indicate its potential interaction with kinases like LCK (Lck), an important tyrosine kinase in signal transduction pathways.
Step 4: Given the presence of amide and alcohol functionalities, the molecule might interact with receptors such as HTR2A (serotonin 5-HT2A receptor) and HTR2B (serotonin 5-HT2B receptor), which are known targets for drugs affecting mood and behavior.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and functional groups, the molecule could have potential interactions with genes involved in neurotransmitter systems, including DRD2 (dopamine D2 receptor), DRD3 (dopamine D3 receptor), and DRD4 (dopamine D4 receptor).
