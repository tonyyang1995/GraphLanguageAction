Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])c1cc(=O)c2c(OCC(O)COc3cccc4oc(C(=O)[O-])cc(=O)c34)cccc2o1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex structure containing an aromatic ring system with multiple functional groups such as esters, amides, and an oxygen-containing heterocycle. This structure is indicative of a small molecule that could potentially interact with proteins involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, enzyme activity, and receptor binding.
Step 2: Upon closer inspection, the molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring fused to a benzene ring, which is a common motif in ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are known to be involved in numerous signaling pathways and can be targeted by a wide range of drugs. The presence of this structural feature suggests that the molecule may interact with GPCRs.
Step 3: The molecule also includes an amide group and an ester linkage, which are often found in ligands for enzymes such as cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs), which are involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics and endogenous compounds. Additionally, the presence of an alcohol group and a carboxylic acid group suggests potential interactions with other enzymes like monoamine oxidases (MAOs).
Step 4: Given the presence of a pyrrolidine ring and the overall structure, the molecule could potentially interact with GPCRs that are associated with neurotransmitter systems, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are involved in the regulation of serotonin signaling. The molecule might also interact with adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), which are involved in the regulation of various physiological processes.
Step 5: Considering the metabolic potential of the molecule due to its ester and amide functionalities, it could interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These enzymes play crucial roles in the biotransformation of drugs and other xenobiotics.
Summary of related gene names:
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C
- ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2
- CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4
- CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6
These genes represent the primary targets for the described molecule based on its chemical structure and potential interactions. Other genes listed may not have a direct relationship with the molecule based on the given information. However, further experimental validation would be necessary to confirm these interactions.
