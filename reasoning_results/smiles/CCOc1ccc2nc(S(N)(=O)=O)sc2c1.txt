Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOc1ccc2nc(S(N)(=O)=O)sc2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached, which is characteristic of many drugs that interact with receptors or enzymes. This structure could potentially bind to receptors or influence the activity of enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a sulfonylurea-like moiety (S(N)(=O)) suggests a possible interaction with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) or ion channels, as this functional group is commonly found in compounds that modulate these types of proteins.
Step 3: The overall structure includes a heterocyclic system (cyclohexane ring), which is often recognized by certain enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYPs), indicating potential metabolic interactions.
Step 4: Given the above structural features, the molecule might interact with genes encoding for GPCRs (e.g., DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HRH1) due to its potential to bind to these receptors, or with genes involved in drug metabolism such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, due to its likely interaction with these enzymes.
Step 5: Based on the identified interactions, the related genes are: DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HRH1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4. 
Summary of related genes: DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HRH1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4.
