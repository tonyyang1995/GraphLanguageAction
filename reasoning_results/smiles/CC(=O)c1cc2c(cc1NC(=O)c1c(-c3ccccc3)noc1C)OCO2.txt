Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that contains several functional groups including an amide (CC(=O)), a benzene ring (c1cc2c), and an ester (CO2). This molecular structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes and receptors involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction.
Step 2: The presence of the amide group (CC(=O)) indicates the molecule could interact with enzymes such as CYP2D6, which metabolizes many drugs containing amide bonds. Additionally, this functional group may also interact with receptors like HTR2A and HTR2B, which have amine binding sites.
Step 3: The benzene ring (c1cc2c) and the ester (CO2) suggest possible interactions with enzymes involved in lipid metabolism or drug metabolism, such as CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. These enzymes are known to metabolize various substrates containing aromatic rings and ester groups.
Step 4: The molecule’s overall structure hints at potential interactions with receptors and ion channels, such as DRD2 and KCNH2, due to the presence of multiple functional groups that could form hydrogen bonds or other types of non-covalent interactions.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related genes for this molecule include those involved in neurotransmission (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), metabolism (CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP2C9), and ion channel activity (KCNH2).
