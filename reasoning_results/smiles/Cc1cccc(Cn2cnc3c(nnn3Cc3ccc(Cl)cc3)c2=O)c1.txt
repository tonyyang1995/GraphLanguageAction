Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cccc(Cn2cnc3c(nnn3Cc3ccc(Cl)cc3)c2=O)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure containing multiple rings and functional groups such as a pyrrole ring, a benzene ring, and a ketone group. This complexity suggests that the molecule could be a drug or a chemical with biological activity.
Step 2: Upon closer inspection, the presence of a ketone group and a benzene ring is notable, which are common in molecules that interact with certain enzymes and receptors involved in signal transduction pathways. These features might indicate interactions with genes encoding for enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a quinoline-like structure, which is often associated with binding to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are encoded by several genes in the provided list, including DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, all of which play roles in neurotransmission and may be targets for this molecule.
Step 4: Given the presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocycle and aromatic rings, the molecule could potentially interact with ion channels or transporters. This is relevant to genes like KCNH2, which encodes a potassium channel, and SLC6A4, which encodes a serotonin transporter.
Step 5: Considering the above structural features, the molecule appears to have potential interactions with a variety of genes involved in metabolism, neurotransmission, and ion channel function. The related genes include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, and SLC6A4.
