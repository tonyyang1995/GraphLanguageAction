Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Nc1cc(C(F)(F)F)ccc1-n1cncn1)c1ccc(Br)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrile (Nc1cc(C(F)(F)F)ccc1) and a carbonyl (O=C) group, which are typical functional groups for drug molecules that interact with enzymes and receptors.
Step 2: The presence of fluorine atoms (F) suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in signaling pathways or transport mechanisms, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and drug transporters.
Step 3: The benzene ring with a bromine atom (Br) indicates a possibility of interaction with genes encoding proteins that have roles in drug metabolism or response, such as CYP enzymes (e.g., CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Step 4: The presence of multiple nitrogen atoms (N) and aromatic rings suggests potential binding to receptors like adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 5: Given the complex structure and the presence of functional groups and substituents, this molecule could be related to several genes involved in neurotransmitter systems and signaling pathways, including DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, PTGS1, and SIGMAR1.
