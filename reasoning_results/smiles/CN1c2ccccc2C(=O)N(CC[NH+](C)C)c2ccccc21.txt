Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CN1c2ccccc2C(=O)N(CC[NH+](C)C)c2ccccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring system, which is common in ligands that interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature suggests potential interactions with genes encoding for GPCRs.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-CONH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) indicates the molecule could be an agonist or antagonist for GPCRs, particularly those involved in neurotransmission.
Step 3: The aromatic rings and their substituents suggest the molecule might interact with enzymes such as cytochrome P450s (CYP), which are encoded by genes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, indicating potential metabolism-related effects.
Step 4: The presence of a quinolone-like structure could indicate interaction with genes related to kinases, such as LCK (Lyn kinase).
Step 5: Given the structural complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, the molecule may have interactions with several genes, including but not limited to ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KDR, and LCK.
