Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)CCCCC(=O)c1[n-]c(=O)[n-]c1CSc1nc2ccccc2[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule provided has a complex structure with several functional groups including a carboxamide group (-CONH-) and a phenyl ring. The presence of a carboxamide group suggests it could be an inhibitor or activator of enzymes that metabolize drugs, such as those encoded by CYP (cytochrome P450) genes.
Step 2: Additionally, the molecule contains multiple nitrogen atoms, which are often involved in binding to proteins and could interact with receptors. This suggests potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are encoded by genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
Step 3: The presence of aromatic rings and the overall structure of the molecule might also suggest potential binding to ion channels, which are encoded by genes like KCNH2 and SIGMAR1.
Step 4: Furthermore, the presence of a phenolic group (-OH) in the molecule might indicate potential interactions with enzymes involved in inflammation, such as those encoded by PTGS1 (COX-1/COX-2).
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its functional groups, the molecule is likely to interact with genes encoding enzymes involved in drug metabolism (CYP family), GPCRs (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), ion channels (KCNH2, SIGMAR1), and inflammation-related enzymes (PTGS1).
