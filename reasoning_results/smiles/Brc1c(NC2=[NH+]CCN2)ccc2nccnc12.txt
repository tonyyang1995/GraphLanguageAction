Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Brc1c(NC2=[NH+]CCN2)ccc2nccnc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that contains a benzene ring (B), a nitrogen atom (N), and several heterocycles including pyrrole rings (c1c(...)) and amide groups (NC2=[NH+]CCN2). This structure suggests the molecule could be a derivative of an existing drug or a potential pharmaceutical compound.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (NC2=[NH+]CCN2) indicates that the molecule may have pharmacological activity due to its ability to interact with various biological targets, particularly those involving ion channels, receptors, or enzymes.
Step 3: Considering the structure and potential interactions, this molecule might be related to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other neurotransmitter receptors. The amide group and nitrogen functionalities are common in molecules that interact with these types of receptors.
Step 4: Given the presence of the amide and the positively charged nitrogen, this molecule could potentially interact with GPCRs such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are involved in serotonin signaling pathways. It also has the potential to interact with adrenergic receptors like ADRA1D and ADRA2B, and cholinergic receptors such as CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 5: Therefore, the related genes include: HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4. These genes encode for receptors that could be targeted by the described molecule based on its chemical structure and functional groups.
