Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(Cl)cc1N1CC[NH+](S(=O)(=O)c2ccc3c(c2)OCCO3)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule has a complex structure that includes a benzene ring system, a nitrogen atom, and several functional groups such as an amide, an ester, and a phenol. The presence of these functional groups suggests the molecule could interact with proteins that have binding sites for similar chemical functionalities.
Step 2: Among the listed genes, several are known to encode receptors or enzymes that might interact with molecules containing these functional groups. For instance, the amide group could potentially interact with cholinergic receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), which are G-protein coupled receptors. The ester and phenol groups could be recognized by enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule's structure might allow it to bind to ion channels or transporters. For example, the benzene rings and nitrogen atoms could interact with potassium channels (e.g., KCNH2) or neurotransmitter transporters (e.g., SLC6A2, SLC6A4).
Step 4: Furthermore, the presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule could indicate potential interactions with neurotransmitter receptors, such as dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), or adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2).
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule could be related to the following genes: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, KCNH2, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6. These genes encode proteins that may directly interact with the molecule or are involved in pathways influenced by its pharmacological activity.
