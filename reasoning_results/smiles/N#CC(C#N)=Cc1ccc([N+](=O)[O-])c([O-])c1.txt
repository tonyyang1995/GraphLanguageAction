Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N#CC(C#N)=Cc1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])c([O-])c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a nitrogen atom triple-bonded to carbon (N#C), indicating a nitrile group, which is characteristic of certain drugs and natural products. This feature suggests potential interaction with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The molecule also contains a cyano group (-CN) attached to another carbon atom, which could indicate the presence of a nitrile moiety. This structural element is often found in compounds that interact with various receptors and enzymes.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule has a benzene ring with an amide group (-CONH) and a carboxylate group (-COO-), suggesting it may be a derivative of a benzodiazepine-like structure. Such structures are known to interact with neurotransmitter receptors, particularly those involved in GABAergic signaling and dopamine pathways.
Step 4: Considering the presence of the amide and carboxylate groups, this molecule might interact with enzymes such as CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs and xenobiotics. It may also interact with receptors like HTR2A (serotonin receptor), DRD2 (dopamine receptor), and HRH1 (histamine receptor).
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and functional groups, the most likely related genes are those involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and neurotransmission (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4). Other genes may have indirect relationships through their roles in cellular processes affected by the molecule's activity.
