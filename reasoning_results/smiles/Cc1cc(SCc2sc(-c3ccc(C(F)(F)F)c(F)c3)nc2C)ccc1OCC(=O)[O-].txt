Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc(SCc2sc(-c3ccc(C(F)(F)F)c(F)c3)nc2C)ccc1OCC(=O)[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure including aromatic rings, heteroatoms (S, F), and functional groups such as amides and esters. The presence of multiple functional groups suggests it may interact with various biological targets.
Step 2: One of the key functional groups in this molecule is the amide group (-CO-NH-). Amides are often found in drugs that target G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are involved in signal transduction pathways mediated by neurotransmitters and hormones. This functional group aligns well with the presence of several genes related to GPCRs in the provided list.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which is commonly found in ligands for receptors such as dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) and serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6). These receptors play crucial roles in modulating mood, pain perception, and other physiological processes.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of fluorine atoms (F) in the molecule indicates potential interactions with enzymes or transport proteins that have been shown to bind or modify compounds containing fluorine. This is particularly relevant to genes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which encode cytochrome P450 enzymes that metabolize many drugs.
Step 5: Based on the structural features described, the molecule is most likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19.
