Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(N2CC[NH+](CCNC(=O)C3CC[NH+](S(=O)(=O)c4cccs4)CC3)CC2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups such as amide, ester, and aromatic rings. It contains a quinoline ring system, which is known for its potential to interact with various receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a quinoline ring, along with the amide and ester functionalities, suggests that this molecule could potentially interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are often associated with neurotransmitter signaling pathways. This is supported by the presence of several GPCR-related genes in the provided list, including HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule's structure includes a nitrophenyl group, which can be recognized by certain enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYP). Among the listed genes, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are known to be involved in the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics, indicating that this molecule might interact with these enzymes.
Step 4: Furthermore, the molecule's overall structure and functional groups suggest potential interactions with ion channels and transporters. For instance, SLC6A2 and SLC6A4 are sodium-dependent transporter proteins, which might be influenced by the molecule's chemical properties.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the related genes to the molecule are likely to include those involved in neurotransmitter signaling (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6), and ion channel/transporter function (SLC6A2, SLC6A4).
