Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C#Cc1cnc2[n-]c(=O)n(C(CC)CC)c2n1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a molecule that is a derivative of the compound nicotine, specifically a substituted pyrrole-2-carboxamide. This structure includes a nitrogen atom with a positive charge, which is characteristic of nicotine and its derivatives.
Step 2: Nicotine and its derivatives interact with various nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) involved in neurotransmission. The pattern of substituents on the molecule, particularly the amide group and the positively charged nitrogen, suggest that this molecule could bind to and modulate nAChRs.
Step 3: The specific nAChRs that might be targeted by this molecule include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4. These genes encode for subunits of different types of nAChRs, which are involved in various physiological processes such as muscle contraction, synaptic transmission, and addiction.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's interaction with nAChRs could potentially influence downstream signaling pathways mediated by other genes such as HTR1A, HTR2A, and HTR2C, which are involved in serotonin receptor function. Serotonin receptors are also known to interact with nicotine derivatives.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its likely binding to nAChRs and serotonin receptors, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, and HTR2C.
