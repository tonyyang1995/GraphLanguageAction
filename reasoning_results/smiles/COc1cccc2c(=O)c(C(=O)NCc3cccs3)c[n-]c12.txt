Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a tricyclic core structure, which is characteristic of certain ligands for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This suggests potential interaction with GPCRs.
Step 2: The presence of a quinoline ring and a carboxamide group indicates possible activity as an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes such as CYP2D6 and CYP2C9, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The presence of a pyrrolidine ring and a nitrile group might suggest potential interaction with proteins like HTR2A, which is a serotonin receptor, and other GPCRs.
Step 4: The overall structure hints at possible modulation of ion channels, particularly those involving calcium or potassium, which could relate to genes like KCNH2 and CACNA1H.
Step 5: Based on the structure, the molecule may interact with multiple genes, including but not limited to: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, HTR2A, KCNH2, and CACNA1H.
