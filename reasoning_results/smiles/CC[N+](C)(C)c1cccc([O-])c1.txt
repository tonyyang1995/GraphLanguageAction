Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC[N+](C)(C)c1cccc([O-])c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a nitrogen atom that carries a positive charge, represented by [N+]. This indicates the presence of an amine group that can act as a ligand for receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The molecule also contains an oxygen atom with a negative charge, represented by [O-], which suggests the presence of a carboxylate group. Carboxylates are common in ligands that interact with certain receptors or enzymes.
Step 3: The molecule's structure includes aromatic rings (indicated by the benzene ring representation) and alkyl chains, which could be involved in interactions with proteins such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 4: Given the potential for interaction with GPCRs and the presence of charged functional groups, this molecule may be related to genes encoding receptors like DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), HTR2A (Serotonin receptor 5-HT2A), and HRH1 (Histamine receptor H1).
Step 5: Additionally, the presence of a carboxylate group might suggest interactions with enzymes or transporters, potentially linking it to genes like CYP2D6 (Cytochrome P450 2D6) or SLC6A4 (Solute carrier family 6 member 4).
Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2
- HTR2A
- HRH1
- CYP2D6
- SLC6A4
These genes are relevant because they encode receptors and enzymes that could interact with the described chemical structure. The positive and negative charges, as well as the aromatic and aliphatic components, suggest potential binding sites for these proteins. However, without further experimental data, this is based on structural similarity and known interaction patterns.
