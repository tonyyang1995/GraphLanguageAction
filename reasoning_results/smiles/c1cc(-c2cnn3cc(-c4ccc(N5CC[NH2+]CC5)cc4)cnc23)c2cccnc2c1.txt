Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: c1cc(-c2cnn3cc(-c4ccc(N5CC[NH2+]CC5)cc4)cnc23)c2cccnc2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains multiple aromatic rings and nitrogen atoms, suggesting it may interact with receptors that have similar structural features. Notably, it has a tricyclic structure with a central benzene ring, which is common in many receptor ligands.
Step 2: The presence of a quinoline-like moiety (quinoline is a heterocyclic compound containing a benzene ring fused to an imidazole ring) indicates potential interaction with receptors that bind such structures, including some G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The molecule also includes a pyrrolidine group, which can form hydrogen bonds and contribute to binding to proteins with polar surfaces, particularly those involved in neurotransmission.
Step 4: Given the pattern of functional groups and overall structure, this molecule could potentially interact with receptors such as DRD2 (Dopamine D2 receptor), HTR2A (Serotonin 5-HT2A receptor), and HTR2B (Serotonin 5-HT2B receptor), all of which are known to have binding sites for molecules with similar characteristics.
Step 5: The related genes include DRD2, HTR2A, and HTR2B, which encode for dopamine and serotonin receptors respectively, highlighting the potential interaction between the molecule and these neurotransmitter systems. 
Summary of related genes: DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B.
