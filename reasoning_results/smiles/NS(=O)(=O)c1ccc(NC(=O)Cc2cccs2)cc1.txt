Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(NC(=O)Cc2cccs2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a structure that includes a nitroso group (NS(=O)(=O)), an amide group (NC(=O)), and a cyclic structure (c1...c1). This structure suggests the molecule could be a derivative of a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compound, which often interacts with receptors or enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: Considering the presence of an amide group and a nitroso group, this molecule likely interacts with enzymes that metabolize such functional groups, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). These enzymes are known to catalyze the oxidation of amides and nitroso compounds, which are common in drug metabolism.
Step 3: Additionally, the cyclic structure might suggest the molecule could interact with ion channels or receptors that have similar cyclic structures in their binding sites, such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are serotonin receptors.
Step 4: Given the pattern of interactions and the nature of the molecule, it is also possible that the molecule could influence G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly those involved in neurotransmission, such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are dopamine receptors.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the genes that may be related to the given molecule are: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
