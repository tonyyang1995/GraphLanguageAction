Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCOC1(c2ccccc2)OC(=O)c2ccccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule, represented by the SMILES string CCCCOC1(c2ccccc2)OC(=O)c2ccccc21, contains a benzene ring system, which is a common structural feature in many drugs and small molecules that interact with receptors and enzymes. The presence of multiple aromatic rings suggests the molecule could be involved in interactions with proteins that have binding sites for such structures.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a pyrrole ring (indicated by the nitrogen atom within a five-membered ring), which is known to form hydrogen bonds and can participate in various biological processes, including enzyme inhibition and receptor binding. This structural feature may allow the molecule to interact with proteins that contain amino acid residues capable of forming hydrogen bonds with this type of moiety.
Step 3: Considering the drug targets listed, several of them are known to interact with molecules containing aromatic rings and/or pyrrole groups. For instance, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 are cytochrome P450 enzymes that metabolize drugs and xenobiotics, often through reactions involving aromatic rings and hydroxylations. These enzymes are known to bind to and modify molecules with similar structural features.
Step 4: Additionally, some of the G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) listed, such as DRD2, DRD3, and HTR2A, are known to interact with small molecules that contain aromatic and heterocyclic systems, including pyrroles. These receptors recognize and bind to ligands based on their shape and functional groups, which often include aromatic rings and other functional groups like amine or hydroxyl groups.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions with proteins, the related genes from the provided list are likely to be those encoding enzymes involved in metabolism (CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP3A4) and GPCRs (DRD2, DRD3, HTR2A).
Summary of related gene names: CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, HTR2A.
