Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOc1ccc(NC(C)=O)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a benzene ring system with an amide group attached to it, specifically at the position next to the carboxylic acid. This structural feature is indicative of a drug-like compound that could interact with proteins involved in neurotransmission or other biological processes.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the amide group suggests that the molecule might be capable of forming hydrogen bonds, which are important for binding to receptors or enzymes that have polar or charged amino acid residues.
Step 3: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring, which is known to participate in various biological interactions such as binding to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are often targets for drugs due to their role in signal transduction pathways.
Step 4: Considering the structural features of the molecule, it could potentially interact with several genes listed here that are involved in neurotransmission or signal transduction, such as DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), HTR2A (Serotonin receptor 5-HT2A), and CHRM1 (Cholinergic receptor muscarinic M1).
Step 5: Based on the interaction potential with these types of receptors, the related gene names are: DRD2, HTR2A, and CHRM1.
Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2
- HTR2A
- CHRM1
These genes encode receptors that are likely to interact with the described molecular structure due to its potential to form hydrogen bonds and bind to aromatic and heterocyclic rings. Other genes may also be relevant but were not directly deduced from the molecule's structure in this analysis. Step 1: The molecule has a benzene ring system with an amide group attached to it, indicating a possible interaction with proteins involved in various cellular processes.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the amide group suggests hydrogen bonding capabilities, which are crucial for binding to proteins with polar or charged residues.
Step 3: The molecule includes a pyrrole ring, which can participate in interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), a common target for many drugs.
Step 4: Given the potential for hydrogen bonding and interaction with aromatic and heterocyclic structures, the molecule may relate to neurotransmitter receptors such as dopamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine.
Step 5: Based on these structural features, the related gene names are: DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, and CHRM3.
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- HTR6
- CHRM3
