Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc(C(=O)NCc2ccc(OCC[NH+](C)C)cc2)cc(OC)c1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound with a structure that includes a benzene ring, an amide group (-CO-N), and multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH). This structure suggests the molecule could be involved in interactions with enzymes or receptors that have binding sites for similar functional groups.
Step 2: Considering the presence of an amide group and hydroxyl groups, the molecule may interact with enzymes that metabolize compounds containing these functional groups. CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are known cytochrome P450 enzymes that metabolize various substrates, including those with amides and hydroxyl groups. Therefore, the molecule could potentially influence the activity of these enzymes.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a quinoline-like structure, which might suggest interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are often targeted by drugs due to their role in signaling pathways. Among the provided genes, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 are all serotonin receptors, which are GPCRs. The presence of the quinoline-like structure could indicate potential interactions with these receptors.
Step 4: Given the overall complexity of the molecule, it could also interact with other enzymes or receptors not listed here, such as those involved in metabolism or neurotransmission. However, based on the available information, the most likely candidates are the enzymes and receptors mentioned above.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the molecules may be related to the following genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes encode proteins that are involved in metabolic processes and neurotransmitter signaling, which aligns with the functional groups present in the molecule.
