Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])c1cn(-c2ccc(F)cc2)c2cc(N3CC[NH2+]CC3)c(F)cc2c1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex molecule that includes a carboxylate group (-COO-), a nitrile group (CN), and several aromatic rings, likely indicating a compound with potential pharmacological activity.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylate group suggests this molecule could act as an inhibitor or activator of enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). These enzymes are known to metabolize various drugs, and their activity can be influenced by small molecules like the one described.
Step 3: The nitrile group and aromatic rings might indicate interactions with receptors or ion channels. For instance, compounds with similar structures have been shown to interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which include genes such as DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), DRD3 (Dopamine receptor D3), and DRD4 (Dopamine receptor D4).
Step 4: The presence of functional groups like the carboxylate and nitrile might also suggest potential binding sites for proteins involved in signaling pathways, such as HRH1 (Histamine H1 receptor) and HTR2A (Serotonin receptor 2A), which play roles in neurotransmission and are associated with various neurological disorders.
Step 5: Given the structural complexity and the presence of functional groups that could interact with enzymes and receptors, the molecule may be related to the following genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HRH1, and HTR2A.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP1A2
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- DRD2
- DRD3
- DRD4
- HRH1
- HTR2A Step 5: Summary of related gene names:
- HTR2A
The molecule is likely to interact with these genes due to its chemical structure, which includes functional groups that can influence enzyme activity and receptor binding. This interaction could affect drug metabolism and neurotransmission. However, further experimental validation would be necessary to confirm these relationships.
