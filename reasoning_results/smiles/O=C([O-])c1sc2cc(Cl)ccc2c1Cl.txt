Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])c1sc2cc(Cl)ccc2c1Cl, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a structure that includes a benzene ring with an oxygen double bond (phenol), a negatively charged oxygen atom, and a chlorine substituent. This structure suggests it may interact with enzymes involved in metabolism or transport processes.
Step 2: The presence of a phenolic group and a negatively charged oxygen atom indicates potential interactions with proteins that have hydrophobic binding sites or acidic residues. This could be relevant for genes encoding membrane transporters or receptors.
Step 3: Given the molecule's ability to bind to and potentially modulate the activity of certain proteins due to its chemical structure, it might interact with genes coding for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which often have hydrophobic binding pockets for ligands.
Step 4: Considering the potential for the molecule to act as a ligand for receptors, it could be relevant to genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are all associated with GPCRs involved in neurotransmission.
Step 5: The molecule's structure also hints at possible interactions with genes related to drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, as it contains functional groups that could be recognized by these enzymes.
