Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])C[NH+]1CC[NH+](Cc2ccc(F)cc2Cl)C1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex molecule that includes an aromatic ring system, a ketone group, and multiple substituents such as alkyl chains, fluorine atoms, and chlorine atoms. This structure suggests the molecule could be a drug-like compound with potential interactions with receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: Considering the presence of a ketone group (C=O) and amide functionalities (-NH-CO-), this molecule likely interacts with proteins that have binding sites for such functional groups, such as enzymes or receptors. The presence of a nitrogen atom in a positive charge form (+N) indicates a potential interaction with negatively charged sites, possibly found in ion channels or receptors.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a benzene ring with fluorine and chlorine substituents, which are common in drug design to modulate lipophilicity and enhance pharmacokinetic properties. This structural feature may indicate the molecule is designed to interact with membrane-bound proteins like ion channels or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 4: Among the listed genes, those encoding receptors and ion channels, as well as enzymes involved in metabolism, are the most likely candidates for interaction with this molecule. For example, genes encoding GPCRs such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HRH1, and genes encoding ion channels like KCNH2, CACNA1H, and SIGMAR1, are all plausible targets due to their membrane-bound nature and known ligand-binding capabilities.
Step 5: Additionally, genes encoding enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, could also be related if the molecule is designed to be metabolized by these enzymes. Furthermore, genes encoding receptors like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, and kinases like LCK and PTGS1, might also be relevant based on the molecule’s potential to bind or modulate these proteins.
