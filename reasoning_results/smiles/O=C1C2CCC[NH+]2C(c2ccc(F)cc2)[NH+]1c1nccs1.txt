Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C1C2CCC[NH+]2C(c2ccc(F)cc2)[NH+]1c1nccs1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with a nitrile group and a cyano group, which are characteristic of certain drug-like molecules that can interact with receptors or enzymes. This structural feature suggests potential interaction with genes encoding for receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom with positive charge indicates the molecule could act as a ligand for ion channels or receptors that bind positively charged molecules. This is relevant to genes encoding ion channels and receptors.
Step 3: The molecule includes fluorine atoms attached to a benzene ring, which might affect its pharmacokinetic properties and binding affinity. This is particularly important for genes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: The overall structure and functional groups suggest the molecule could be a potential inhibitor or agonist for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), given the presence of aromatic rings and amine groups. This is pertinent to genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, and DRD2, which encode GPCRs.
Step 5: Given the complexity and specific functional groups, the molecule may also interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.
