Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [O-]c1ccc(-c2nc3cc([O-])cc(Br)c3o2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule containing an anionic oxygen atom (-[O-]) and a bromine atom (Br), which suggests it could be involved in interactions with biological targets that have charged groups or are sensitive to halogen substituents.
Step 2: Notably, the molecule includes a phenolic group (-OH) and a benzene ring system, which are common motifs in ligands for receptors and transporters. These structural elements might allow the molecule to interact with proteins that have binding sites for aromatic compounds or hydroxyl-containing molecules.
Step 3: Given the presence of an anionic group (-[O-]) and the potential for hydrogen bonding due to the phenolic hydroxyl group, this molecule could potentially interact with ion channels or receptors that require negatively charged ligands or have specific binding sites for hydroxyl groups. This interaction pattern is particularly relevant to genes encoding ion channels and receptors.
Step 4: The molecule’s overall structure does not directly suggest strong interactions with enzymes such as CYPs (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) based on its SMILES string alone. However, it might influence their activity indirectly through modulation of ion channels or receptors that they regulate.
Step 5: Considering the structural features described, the molecule may be related to genes encoding ion channels and receptors, such as those involved in neurotransmission and hormone signaling. Specifically, the related gene names include: KCNH2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HRH1, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
Summary of Related Genes:
- Ion channels: KCNH2
- Serotonin receptors: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C
- Histamine receptor: HRH1
- Cholinergic receptors: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4
- Dopamine receptors: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4
These genes are associated with neurotransmission and hormone signaling pathways, which aligns with the molecule's potential to interact with ion channels and receptors.
