Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc(N)c(Cl)cc1C(=O)NC1CC[NH+](CCCOc2ccc(F)cc2)CC1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains multiple functional groups including a phenol group (oxygen-hydrogen), an amide group (carbonyl-nitrogen), and a nitro group (nitrogen-oxygen). These functional groups suggest that the molecule could be involved in interactions with proteins containing amino acid residues that can form hydrogen bonds or electrostatic interactions.
Step 2: The presence of a quaternary ammonium group (N+ in the structure) indicates that the molecule may have positive charge characteristics. This feature might allow the molecule to interact with negatively charged regions of certain proteins, such as those found in ion channels or receptors.
Step 3: The structure also includes a benzene ring system, which is common in many drug molecules and can participate in aromatic interactions, such as pi-pi stacking, which can stabilize protein-ligand complexes.
Step 4: Considering the functional groups and structural features identified, the molecule might interact with proteins involved in neurotransmitter transport, ion channel function, or receptor binding. Specific examples include proteins with GABAergic, dopaminergic, or adrenergic activity.
Step 5: Based on the identified structural features and potential interactions, the related genes would likely include those encoding for GABA receptors (e.g., GABRA1, GABRB1, GABRG1), dopamine receptors (e.g., DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), adrenergic receptors (e.g., ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), and other ion channels or neurotransmitter transporters.
Summary of related gene names:
- GABRA1
- GABRB1
- GABRG1
- DRD2
- DRD3
- DRD4
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- ADRB2
Note: The provided list of genes does not include all possible candidates based on the molecule's structure, but it highlights some relevant ones given the identified functional groups and structural features. Other genes not listed here might still be relevant depending on additional information about the molecule's pharmacological profile.
