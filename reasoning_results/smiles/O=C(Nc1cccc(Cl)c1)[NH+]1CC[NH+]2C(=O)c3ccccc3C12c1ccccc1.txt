Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Nc1cccc(Cl)c1)[NH+]1CC[NH+]2C(=O)c3ccccc3C12c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple functional groups such as an amide (N=C), ester (C=O), and aromatic rings (c1cccc). This indicates it could interact with proteins involved in signaling pathways and metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of an amine group (-NH+) suggests the molecule may act as a ligand for receptors that bind amines, such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 3: The ester linkage (C=O) implies the molecule might be an inhibitor or activator of enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP3A4, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: The aromatic ring system (c1cccc) and the overall structure suggest potential interaction with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and HRH1, which are known to have binding sites for various ligands.
Step 5: Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, this molecule likely has diverse pharmacological effects, possibly interacting with several of the listed genes including but not limited to: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1.
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1.
