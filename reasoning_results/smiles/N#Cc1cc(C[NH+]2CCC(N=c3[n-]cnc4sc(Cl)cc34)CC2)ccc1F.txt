Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N#Cc1cc(C[NH+]2CCC(N=c3[n-]cnc4sc(Cl)cc34)CC2)ccc1F, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a nitrogen atom triple-bonded to carbon (N#C), indicating it likely contains a pyrrole or similar heterocyclic ring system. This structural feature could potentially interact with proteins involved in signal transduction or ion transport, such as receptors or ion channels.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a benzene ring with substituents, including fluorine (F) and amide groups (-NHCOCH3). These functional groups are common in ligands that bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are encoded by genes like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4. Benzene rings and amides can form stable interactions with the hydrophobic and polar pockets of receptor proteins.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a quinolone-like structure (as seen in the C[NH+]2CCC(N=c3[n-]cnc4sc(Cl)cc34)CC2 segment) suggests potential interaction with enzymes or receptors involved in neurotransmitter metabolism or signaling pathways, which may be influenced by genes like CYP2D6 and HTR2A.
Step 4: The overall structure does not suggest direct interaction with enzymes typically associated with the cytochrome P450 family (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which would typically involve more complex aromatic rings and hydroxylated substrates.
Step 5: Based on the molecular features described, the most likely related genes are those encoding GPCRs (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) and enzymes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism (CYP2D6, HTR2A).
Summary of related gene names: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2D6, HTR2A. Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom triple-bonded to carbon (N#C), indicating it has a pyrrole or similar heterocyclic ring system.
Step 2: The molecule has benzene rings with substituents like fluorine (F) and amide groups, which can interact with GPCRs.
Step 3: The quinolone-like structure suggests potential interaction with neurotransmitter metabolism-related enzymes.
Step 4: The structure does not indicate direct interaction with cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Step 5: Likely related genes include DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2D6, and HTR2A. 
Related gene names: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2D6, HTR2A. Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom triple-bonded to carbon (N#C), suggesting a pyrrole or similar heterocyclic ring system.
Step 2: The benzene ring and amide group indicate potential binding to GPCRs.
Step 3: The quinolone-like structure hints at possible interaction with neurotransmitter metabolism enzymes.
Step 4: No direct indication of interaction with cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Step 5: Genes related to the molecule are DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2D6, and
