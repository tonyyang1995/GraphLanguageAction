Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1c[n-]c(=O)n(CCC[NH+]2CCN(c3ccccc3OCC(F)(F)F)CC2)c1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a molecule that includes a nitrogen atom with a negative charge (-), indicating a quaternary amine or a similar functional group. This feature suggests the molecule could interact with receptors or transport proteins that recognize charged groups.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring system and an amide group (-CONH-) is notable. Benzene rings are common in many drug molecules and can interact with various receptors, including G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). The amide group can form hydrogen bonds and is often involved in binding to enzymes and receptors.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) and several other substituents such as fluoro groups (-F). These functional groups can contribute to the molecule’s pharmacological properties, such as binding affinity and metabolic stability, which might influence its interaction with certain genes.
Step 4: Considering the molecular features, this compound might interact with genes encoding for GPCRs, as the benzene ring and amide group suggest potential binding sites for these receptors. Additionally, due to the presence of a phenolic group and other functional groups, the molecule could also interact with genes involved in metabolism and signaling pathways.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related genes likely include those involved in GPCR function, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. Other potential related genes may include CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism. Additionally, PTGS1 and SIGMAR1, which are involved in prostaglandin synthesis and signaling respectively, could also be relevant.
