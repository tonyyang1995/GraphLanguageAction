Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(NC(=O)c2c(-c3c(F)cccc3Cl)noc2C)cc1F, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a nitro group (N-C(=O)-C), which is a common functional group that can interact with various proteins and enzymes. This feature suggests potential interactions with enzymes and receptors that contain binding sites for such functional groups.
Step 2: The molecule also includes fluorine and chlorine atoms, which are often involved in drug design due to their ability to modulate molecular properties like lipophilicity and bioavailability. These halogen atoms could influence the interaction with membrane-bound receptors and transporters.
Step 3: The presence of a benzene ring with substituents (such as fluoro and chloro substituents) indicates that the molecule might have affinity for proteins that recognize aromatic amino acid residues or other aromatic ligands, potentially including certain G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels.
Step 4: Considering the pattern of substituents and the overall structure, this molecule might interact with enzymes and transporters involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, as well as transporters like ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein) which are known to be influenced by similar chemical structures.
Step 5: Given the detailed structure and its potential interactions, the related genes include: ABCB1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
