Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N=c1[n-][n-]c2nc(-c3ccc(NS(=O)(=O)c4cc(Cl)ccc4F)cc3)cnc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this is relevant.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitro group (-N=) and a sulfonamide group (NS(=O)(=O)), which are known to interact with various enzymes and transport proteins.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and a fluorine atom suggests the molecule could be a substrate or inhibitor for enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2D6 and CYP3A4.
Step 3: The molecule's overall structure, including the nitrogen heterocycles and aromatic rings, indicates potential interactions with receptors like adrenergic (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and dopaminergic (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) receptors.
Step 4: The presence of a carbamate group (-OC(=O)-) and the overall size of the molecule suggest it might interact with kinases, such as LCK, which is encoded by the LCK gene.
Step 5: Given the structural features and potential interactions, the molecule is most likely related to the following genes: CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, LCK.
Summary of related genes: CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, LCK. Step 1: The molecule contains a nitro group (-N=) and a sulfonamide group (NS(=O)(=O)), which are known to interact with various enzymes and transport proteins.
