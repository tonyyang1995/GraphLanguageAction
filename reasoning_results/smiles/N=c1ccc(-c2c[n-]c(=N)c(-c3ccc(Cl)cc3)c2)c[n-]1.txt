Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N=c1ccc(-c2c[n-]c(=N)c(-c3ccc(Cl)cc3)c2)c[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex aromatic compound containing multiple nitrogen atoms and a cyclic structure. Notably, it includes a pyrrole ring and a pyridine ring, which are common motifs in ligands that interact with various receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a quaternary ammonium group (-n-) and the overall shape of the molecule suggest potential interactions with ion channels or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), given their affinity for charged groups and specific conformational shapes.
Step 3: Considering the structure of the molecule, it could potentially bind to receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) due to its aromatic rings and quaternary ammonium functionality, which are known to interact with these receptors.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule might also have affinity for serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), as the aromatic rings and nitrogen functionalities are typical of compounds that modulate these receptors.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and the described interactions, the related genes would include those encoding adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Summary of related gene names:
