Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [O-]c1ccc(Cl)cc1Cc1cc(Cl)cc(Cc2cc(Cl)ccc2[O-])c1[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains multiple aromatic rings and heteroatoms such as oxygen and chlorine, which are common in ligands that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This suggests the molecule could potentially bind to GPCRs.
Step 2: The presence of an imidazole ring in the molecule indicates it might interact with histidine residues, which are found in several receptors including dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 3: The molecule's overall shape and functional groups, particularly the carboxylate groups, suggest it may be involved in interactions with ion channels or transporters. For example, CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) are involved in drug metabolism, and their activity can be modulated by compounds with similar structures.
Step 4: The molecule’s ability to form hydrogen bonds due to its hydroxyl and carboxylate groups implies it could interact with proteins that have catalytic or regulatory functions, such as kinases (CDK2, LCK, MCL1) and receptor tyrosine kinases (KDR).
Step 5: Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, the molecule is likely to interact with a variety of targets rather than just a single gene. However, based on the identified structural patterns, the related genes include: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CDK2, LCK, MCL1, KDR. Summary of related genes: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CDK2, LCK, MCL1, KDR.
