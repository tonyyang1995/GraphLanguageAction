Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccccc1COC(=O)Nc1c(C)nn(C)c1Cl, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is a common structural motif found in many drugs and ligands that interact with receptors and enzymes. This structure is often involved in binding to protein targets such as receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The molecule also has a pyrrole ring fused to the benzene ring, which is characteristic of certain ligands that can modulate the activity of enzymes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, known for their role in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH2) suggests potential interactions with ion channels and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly those associated with neurotransmission and signaling pathways, such as DRD2, HTR1A, and HTR2A.
Step 4: The molecule includes a chloro substituent, which could contribute to its pharmacological profile by affecting its metabolic stability and affinity for certain targets, possibly influencing genes involved in drug transport and metabolism like ABCB1 and SLC6A4.
Step 5: Considering the molecular structure and functional groups, the molecule may have interactions with multiple genes, including but not limited to: ABCB1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, and SLC6A4.
