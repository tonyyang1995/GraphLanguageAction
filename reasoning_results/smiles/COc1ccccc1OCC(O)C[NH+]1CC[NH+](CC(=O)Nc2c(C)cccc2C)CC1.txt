Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccccc1OCC(O)C[NH+]1CC[NH+](CC(=O)Nc2c(C)cccc2C)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring, an oxygen atom, and multiple nitrogen atoms, indicating it likely has pharmacological activity. The presence of an amide group (-CONH-) and an ester group (-COOR-) suggests potential interactions with receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The molecule contains a quinolone-like structure, which is known to interact with certain receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and cell signaling. This structural feature may be relevant to several genes related to neurotransmitter receptors and enzymes.
Step 3: Notably, the molecule’s structure includes a benzodiazepine-like moiety, which is known to interact with GABAA receptors (e.g., HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C). Benzodiazepines are known to modulate the function of these receptors, suggesting a possible interaction with these genes.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of an aromatic ring and amide groups could potentially interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 5: Based on the above structural analysis, the molecule is likely to have interactions with the following genes: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19.
