Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: OCc1ccc(-c2nn(Cc3ccccc3)c3ccccc23)o1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that includes several functional groups such as an oxygen (O), carbon (C) chains, nitrogen (N) heteroatoms, and aromatic rings. Notably, the presence of aromatic rings and the nitrogen-containing heterocycles suggest the molecule may interact with receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmission or metabolism.
Step 2: The structure contains potential binding sites for molecules interacting with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to its aromatic rings and nitrogen atoms which could form hydrogen bonds. This suggests the molecule might be relevant to genes encoding GPCRs such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 3: Given the presence of nitrogen atoms and the overall structure, the molecule might also interact with enzymes involved in metabolism or drug metabolism, like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. These cytochrome P450 enzymes are known to metabolize many drugs, and their interaction with the molecule could affect pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of an oxygen atom and the overall structure might indicate the molecule could be a ligand for other receptors or ion channels. For example, it could interact with KCNH2 (a potassium channel) or PTGS1 (which encodes cyclooxygenase-1, involved in prostaglandin synthesis).
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule is likely related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, KCNH2, PTGS1.
