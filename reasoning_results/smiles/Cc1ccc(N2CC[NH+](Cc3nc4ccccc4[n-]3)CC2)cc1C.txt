Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(N2CC[NH+](Cc3nc4ccccc4[n-]3)CC2)cc1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom within its structure, which is part of a cyclic amine group attached to a benzene ring. This structural feature suggests potential interaction with proteins that bind or metabolize amines, such as certain receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a quinoline ring system (N2CC[NH+]) indicates a possible interaction with enzymes involved in phase I metabolism, specifically those containing cytochrome P450 enzymes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are known to metabolize quinolines.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a tricyclic structure with nitrogen atoms, which could interact with ion channels and receptors. For example, it may have affinity for calcium channels (CACNA1H), GABA receptors (GABRA1, GABRB1), or muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 4: Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, the molecule might also interact with receptors involved in neurotransmission, such as serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), and other neurotransmitter systems.
Step 5: The molecule's overall structure and functional groups suggest potential interactions with several genes, including CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CACNA1H, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
