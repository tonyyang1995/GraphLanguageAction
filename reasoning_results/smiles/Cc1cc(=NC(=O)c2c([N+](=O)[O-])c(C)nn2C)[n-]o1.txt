Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc(=NC(=O)c2c([N+](=O)[O-])c(C)nn2C)[n-]o1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a pyrrole ring system, which is characteristic of many drugs that interact with receptors and transport proteins. This structure suggests potential interactions with genes encoding for receptors or transporters.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrile (-CN) group indicates that the molecule could be involved in inhibiting enzymes such as cytochrome P450 (CYP), which are encoded by several genes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These enzymes play crucial roles in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The molecule also has a quinoline-like structure with a carboxamide (-CONH-) group, which might indicate it could act as an antagonist or agonist at G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are encoded by genes such as DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are involved in neurotransmission.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a nitrophenyl group (-NO2) and the overall structure suggest the molecule could have affinity for ion channels, particularly those encoded by genes like KCNH2, which encodes the hERG potassium channel.
Step 5: Given the detailed structure and functional groups present, the molecule is likely to interact with multiple genes, including those involved in neurotransmission (e.g., DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C), drug metabolism (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6), and ion channel function (e.g., KCNH2).
