Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCSc1nc(=NC(=S)Nc2ccc(OC)cc2)cc(C)[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure including a core benzene ring with substituents such as cyclohexyl, sulfur-containing groups, and a nitrogen heterocycle. This pattern suggests potential interactions with proteins that have similar chemical motifs or binding sites.
Step 2: Notably, the molecule contains a thiourea group (S-N=C-N), which is known to interact with various receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways. Thiourea groups are often found in ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: Given the presence of a thiourea group, the molecule could potentially bind to GPCRs such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are serotonin receptors. These receptors play crucial roles in modulating mood, sleep, and pain perception.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule might interact with other receptors like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are dopamine receptors. Dopamine receptors are involved in reward, motivation, and movement control.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4. These genes encode receptors that could be targeted by the molecule due to its chemical structure and functional groups. Step 5: Summary of Related Gene Names: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4. These genes encode receptors that the molecule might interact with based on its chemical structure.
