Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1cc(CSc2ccc(Cl)cc2)[n-]c(-c2ccccn2)n1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this relationship might be important.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrile group (-C#N), which is characteristic of molecules that can interact with enzymes such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) family members, particularly CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. These enzymes are known to metabolize drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 2: The molecule also has a phenyl ring attached to the nitrile group, which could potentially form hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues in the active site of receptors like DRD2, HTR2A, and HTR2B, all of which are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The presence of a benzene ring and a sulfur-containing heteroatom (sulfur in the thioether group) may also allow the molecule to interact with other drug targets such as ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein), which is involved in the efflux of various substrates including some drugs.
Step 4: The nitrogen atom in the nitrile group and the amine group in the cyclic amine structure could participate in hydrogen bonding with proteins, which might affect the activity of enzymes or receptors such as those mentioned above.
Step 5: Based on the structural features described, the molecule may be related to the following genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, and ABCB1. Step 5: Summary of related gene names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, ABCB1.
