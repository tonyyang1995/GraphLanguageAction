Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N=c1[n-]c(=N)c2nc(-c3ccccc3)c(=N)[n-]c2[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex heterocyclic compound, which includes a nitrogen-containing ring (triazole) and multiple nitrogen atoms with negative charges. This structure suggests that the molecule is likely an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors that interact with nitrogen-containing moieties.
Step 2: Considering the presence of multiple nitrogen atoms with negative charges, this molecule could potentially interact with ion channels or receptors that have binding sites for negatively charged molecules. For example, it might target ion channels like KCNH2 (hERG potassium channel), which has a negatively charged region near its binding site.
Step 3: The molecule’s structure also indicates the possibility of interacting with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). The presence of aromatic rings and nitrogen atoms could suggest interactions with adrenergic receptors such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4, which are known to bind to various ligands including those with aromatic and nitrogenous groups.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule may influence enzymes involved in drug metabolism, given the presence of functional groups like amide and carboxylic acid, which are common in substrates for CYP enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These enzymes metabolize many drugs, and inhibitors of these enzymes can affect their pharmacological activity.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: KCNH2, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These genes encode proteins that are directly involved in the interaction or metabolism of the described molecular structure.
