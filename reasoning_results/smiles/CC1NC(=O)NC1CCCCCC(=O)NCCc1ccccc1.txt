Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC1NC(=O)NC1CCCCCC(=O)NCCc1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure containing several functional groups including an amide (-CONH-), phenyl rings (C6H5), and a cyclic amide (indole ring). These structural elements suggest the molecule could be a ligand for receptors that interact with such chemical moieties.
Step 2: Considering the presence of aromatic rings and amide bonds, this molecule likely targets G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways. Specifically, it may interact with receptors like adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), and dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4).
Step 3: The cyclic amide structure (indole ring) also indicates potential interaction with enzymes such as cytochrome P450s (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a benzene ring and amide groups might influence the binding affinity for other receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmitter signaling and inflammation, such as serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) and prostaglandin synthase (PTGS1).
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, PTGS1. These genes encode proteins that are directly or indirectly influenced by the molecule's chemical structure through receptor binding or enzymatic activity.
