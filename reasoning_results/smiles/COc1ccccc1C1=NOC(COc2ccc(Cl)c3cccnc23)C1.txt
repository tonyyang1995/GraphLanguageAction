Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccccc1C1=NOC(COc2ccc(Cl)c3cccnc23)C1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a benzene ring with various functional groups attached, including an amide group (-CONH), a nitroso group (-N=O), and a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH). This complex structure suggests that the molecule may interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways or enzymatic activities.
Step 2: The presence of a nitroso group (-N=O) indicates the molecule could potentially be a nitrosamine derivative, which has been shown to activate certain nuclear receptors or interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Nuclear receptors are transcription factors that can bind to DNA and regulate gene expression, while GPCRs are involved in cellular signaling pathways.
Step 3: Among the listed genes, several are known to be involved in signaling pathways and nuclear receptor functions, such as HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A), HTR2B (serotonin receptor 2B), HTR2C (serotonin receptor 2C), and HTR1A (serotonin receptor 1A). These genes encode for GPCRs that respond to serotonin, a neurotransmitter often implicated in mood regulation and other physiological processes.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure may also interact with enzymes encoded by genes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics. These cytochrome P450 enzymes play a crucial role in biotransformation processes, and their activity can influence drug efficacy and safety.
Step 5: Based on the structural features of the molecule and its potential interactions with proteins, the related genes include: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Summary of related gene names:
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
These genes are associated with serotonin receptor functions and drug metabolism, which align with the molecular structure described. Other genes listed might not have a direct relationship based on the given information. However, further analysis would be needed to confirm any potential interactions beyond these seven genes.
