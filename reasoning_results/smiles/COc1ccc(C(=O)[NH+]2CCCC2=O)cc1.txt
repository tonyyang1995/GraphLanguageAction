Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(C(=O)[NH+]2CCCC2=O)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure featuring a benzene ring system, a pyrrole ring fused to the benzene, and a carboxamide group attached to the pyrrole. This structure suggests potential interactions with receptors or enzymes that have similar chemical motifs.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-CONH-) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is notable. These functional groups are often found in ligands that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes such as cytochrome P450s (CYPs). GPCRs are associated with several of the listed genes, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a quinoline-like moiety (quinoline is a common substructure in many drugs), which could interact with ion channels like KCNH2, or with kinases such as CDK2 and LCK.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a carbonyl group (-CO-) adjacent to a nitrogen atom could suggest a potential interaction with enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 5: Based on the structural features, the molecule may be related to several genes, including: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, CDK2, LCK, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. Step 6: Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, CDK2, LCK, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4.
