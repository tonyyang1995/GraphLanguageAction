Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cccc(N2CC[NH+](CC(=O)N=c3[n-]ccs3)CC2)c1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom in its structure, which is part of an amide group (N=N) that is likely involved in hydrogen bonding. This feature suggests the molecule could interact with proteins that have hydrophobic or charged regions, potentially affecting their function.
Step 2: The presence of a pyrrolidine ring in the molecule indicates a cyclic structure with a nitrogen atom, which can participate in various types of interactions such as hydrogen bonding and π-π stacking. These interactions are crucial for binding to proteins with similar structural motifs.
Step 3: The molecule includes a phenyl ring, which is known to be a common feature in drug molecules due to its ability to form π-π stacking interactions and hydrophobic interactions. These interactions can be important for binding to receptors or enzymes that contain aromatic amino acids.
Step 4: Given the complex structure and functional groups present, the molecule might interact with proteins involved in neurotransmission, receptor signaling, or metabolic pathways. This is because many drugs target these processes and often have similar structural features.
Step 5: Based on the molecule’s potential to interact with proteins involved in neurotransmission and receptor signaling, the following genes may be related: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and SIGMAR1. These genes encode proteins that are directly involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter systems and drug metabolism.
