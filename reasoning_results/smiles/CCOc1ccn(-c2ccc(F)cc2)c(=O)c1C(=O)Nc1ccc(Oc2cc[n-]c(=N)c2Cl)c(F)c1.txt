Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOc1ccn(-c2ccc(F)cc2)c(=O)c1C(=O)Nc1ccc(Oc2cc[n-]c(=N)c2Cl)c(F)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a benzene ring with various functional groups attached to it, including a cyano group (-CN), an amide group (-CONH2), and a fluorine atom (F). These structural features suggest that the molecule may have affinity for receptors or enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways or drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and the amide group indicate potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which often bind to molecules containing aromatic rings and amide functionalities. Specific examples include adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 3: The cyano group (-CN) and the fluorine atom (F) are also indicative of possible interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). These enzymes can modify the molecule through oxidation, hydroxylation, or other reactions, affecting its pharmacological activity.
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule suggests potential binding to receptors involved in neurotransmitter signaling, such as dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), and opioid receptors (OPRK1). These receptors play crucial roles in modulating various physiological processes, including mood, pain perception, and addiction.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is most likely related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, OPRK1. These genes encode proteins involved in signal transduction pathways and drug metabolism, which could be affected by the molecule's structure and chemical properties.
