Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCc1ccc2[n-]c(=Nc3nc(=O)cc(COC)[n-]3)nc(C)c2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a complex structure including aromatic rings, heteroatoms (nitrogens), and functional groups such as amides and esters. These structural features suggest potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for similar chemical moieties.
Step 2: Among the provided genes, those involved in neurotransmitter transport and receptors are particularly relevant due to their binding sites for small molecules. For example, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 encode serotonin receptors, which are known to bind various ligands, including some that may resemble the given molecule’s structure.
Step 3: The molecule also has potential to interact with enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism. These cytochrome P450 enzymes metabolize a wide range of substrates, and the presence of amide and ester functionalities in the molecule suggests it could be a substrate for these enzymes.
Step 4: The presence of nitrogen atoms and aromatic rings might also indicate potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as HRH1, which is involved in histamine signaling. Additionally, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4 are cholinergic receptors that might bind to similar chemical structures.
Step 5: Considering the above points, the molecule could potentially interact with several of the listed genes, including HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
