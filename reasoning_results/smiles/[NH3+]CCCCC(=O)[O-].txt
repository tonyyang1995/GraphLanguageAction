Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [NH3+]CCCCC(=O)[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string [NH3+]CCCCC(=O)[O-] represents an amide compound with an amino group and a carboxylate group. This structure suggests the molecule could be a small molecule ligand or inhibitor that interacts with proteins involved in signaling pathways.
Step 2: Considering the pattern of the molecule, it likely interacts with receptors or enzymes that have binding sites for amides or carboxylic acids. Receptors and enzymes are often targeted by drugs, and their functions can be influenced by the presence of such molecules.
Step 3: Genes encoding receptors or enzymes that interact with amides or carboxylic acids include those for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYP), which metabolize many drugs and xenobiotics. Some relevant genes from the provided list include CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, all of which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: Additionally, some of the listed genes encode neurotransmitter receptors or signaling proteins that might be affected by a compound with similar chemical properties. For instance, HTR2A (serotonin 5-HT2A receptor) and HTR2C (serotonin 5-HT2C receptor) are GPCRs that could potentially bind to the molecule due to its amide and carboxylate groups.
Step 5: Based on the structure of the molecule and the functions of the genes, the related genes are: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, and HTR2C.
Summary of Related Gene Names:
- CYP1A2
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- HTR2A
- HTR2C Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the molecule appears to be related to the following genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, and HTR2C. These genes encode enzymes involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmitter receptors, respectively.
