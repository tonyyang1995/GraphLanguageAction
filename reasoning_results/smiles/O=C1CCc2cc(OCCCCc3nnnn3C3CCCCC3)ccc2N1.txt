Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C1CCc2cc(OCCCCc3nnnn3C3CCCCC3)ccc2N1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule, represented by the SMILES string, contains an aromatic ring system with multiple substituents, including an oxazole ring, a phenyl group, and a pyrrolidine ring. These structural features suggest the molecule may interact with receptors or enzymes that have similar chemical moieties.
Step 2: Among the provided genes, several are involved in neurotransmitter systems or drug metabolism. For example, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 are cytochrome P450 enzymes responsible for metabolizing various drugs, which could interact with the molecule due to its functional groups.
Step 3: Genes like DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), HTR1A (serotonin receptor 1A), HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A), and HTR2B (serotonin receptor 2B) encode receptors that might bind to the molecule due to its potential to fit into the binding sites of these receptors, given the presence of substituents that could mimic natural ligands.
Step 4: The molecule's structure also suggests it could potentially interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as ADRA1D (adrenergic receptor alpha-1D), ADRB2 (adrenergic receptor beta-2), and CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4 (cholinergic receptors), as these receptors often bind to molecules with similar structural features.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and the functions of the provided genes, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, ADRA1D, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
