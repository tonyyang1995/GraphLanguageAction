Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)C(Br)C(=O)[N-]C(N)=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that is a derivative of an aryl ring system, featuring a benzene ring with various substituents such as methyl (C), bromine (Br), carbonyl (C=O), and amide (-CONH-). This structural pattern is characteristic of molecules that can interact with receptors or enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: Among the provided genes, several are known to encode for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which typically bind to small molecule ligands like those found in the described molecule. Specifically, the molecule's amide group could potentially interact with the binding site of certain GPCRs, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4. These receptors are known to be involved in neurotransmission and hormonal signaling.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a carbonyl group in the molecule suggests it might also interact with enzymes or proteins that have active sites containing nucleophilic groups, such as CYP2C19 and CYP2D6. These cytochrome P450 enzymes play crucial roles in drug metabolism and are known to catalyze reactions involving carbonyl compounds.
Step 4: The molecule's overall structure, with its aromatic core and functional groups, could also influence its interaction with other genes involved in cellular signaling and receptor function, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and SIGMAR1, which are all associated with serotonin and sigma receptor systems.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the molecule appears to be potentially relevant to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and SIGMAR1. These genes are primarily involved in receptor function, particularly GPCRs and serotonergic receptors, as well as drug metabolism via cytochrome P450 enzymes.
