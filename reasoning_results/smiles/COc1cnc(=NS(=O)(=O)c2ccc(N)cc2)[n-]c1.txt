Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cnc(=NS(=O)(=O)c2ccc(N)cc2)[n-]c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule has a complex structure that includes a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring system, a sulfur-containing moiety, and a carboxylate group. This pattern suggests it could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways, particularly those associated with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or nuclear receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) indicates potential inhibition of enzymes such as CYP2C19 and CYP2C9, which are known to metabolize drugs containing this functional group. These enzymes are involved in the metabolism of various medications, including some that target GPCRs.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a nitro group (-NO2), which can act as a potent activator or inhibitor of certain enzymes, depending on its position and electronic environment. Nitro groups are often found in compounds that interact with kinases, such as CDK2, which is involved in cell cycle regulation.
Step 4: Given the presence of multiple functional groups and the overall structure, this molecule likely interacts with multiple genes, primarily those encoding GPCRs and enzymes involved in drug metabolism. GPCRs are implicated in various physiological processes, and their modulation can affect the expression and activity of other genes.
Step 5: Based on the described structure and functional groups, the related genes include: ABL1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
Summary of Related Genes: ABL1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
