Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NC(=[NH2+])NCCCC(=O)[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a compound containing an amide group (N-C=O) and an imidazole ring (N-C-N-C=O), which is typical for histamine receptor antagonists and agonists. This structural pattern suggests that the molecule may interact with receptors that bind histamine.
Step 2: Histamine receptors are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and include H1 (CHRM1), H2 (HTR2A), H3 (HIST1), and H4 (HIST4). Among the provided genes, CHRM1 (H1 receptor), HTR2A (H2 receptor), and possibly HTR2B (H2 receptor) could be directly related to this molecule due to their involvement in histamine signaling.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of an imidazole ring and amide group might also suggest interactions with other GPCRs, such as DRD2 (Dopamine D2 receptor), which shares similar binding sites with some histamine receptor ligands, though it is not specifically targeted by histamine itself.
Step 4: Considering the potential interactions with histamine receptors and related GPCRs, the molecule could have effects on genes involved in neurotransmitter systems and signal transduction pathways, including but not limited to CHRM1, HTR2A, HTR2B, DRD2, and possibly others like CYP2D6, which metabolizes many drugs affecting these receptors.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the related genes to the described molecule are likely to be: CHRM1, HTR2A, HTR2B, DRD2, CYP2D6.
Summary of related gene names:
- CHRM1
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- DRD2
- CYP2D6
Note: The gene CYP2D6 is included based on its role in drug metabolism, which affects the activity of receptors mentioned, but it does not directly encode a receptor. Other genes like CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, which were not specifically mentioned in the context of the molecule's structure, are also important for drug metabolism and should be considered if further details about the molecule's pharmacokinetics are provided. However, they are not directly related to the histamine receptor interactions discussed here. The focus was on direct receptor interactions.
