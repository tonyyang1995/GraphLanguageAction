Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)c1cc(Oc2c(Cl)cc(-n3nc(C#N)c(=O)[n-]c3=O)cc2Cl)n[n-]c1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains several functional groups including an amide (-CO-NH-), a carboxylic acid (-COOH), a nitrile (C#N), and a benzene ring with a nitro group (-NO2). The presence of a nitrile group and an amide suggests that the molecule may be an inhibitor of enzymes that metabolize drugs, such as CYP enzymes. 
Step 2: The molecule also includes a benzene ring with a halogen atom (chlorine, Cl), which could indicate potential interactions with receptors or transporters that have binding sites for aromatic compounds, such as ADRB2 and CHRM1.
Step 3: The presence of an alcohol group (-OH) and a cyano group (C#N) might suggest that the molecule has the potential to interact with ion channels, such as KCNH2, which is involved in cardiac function.
Step 4: Given the complex structure with multiple functional groups, it is likely that the molecule could interact with multiple targets, including those involved in G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathways, such as HTR2A and HTR2B.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule may be related to the following genes: ADRB2, CHRM1, KCNH2, HTR2A, HTR2B. These genes are involved in various physiological processes, including cardiac function, neurotransmission, and drug metabolism. 
Summary of related genes: ADRB2, CHRM1, KCNH2, HTR2A, HTR2B.
