Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cn1c(=O)c2c(ncn2CC2OCCO2)n(C)c1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a quinolone-like structure with a benzene ring fused to a pyridine ring, which is a common pharmacophore for many drugs targeting various receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH2) suggests potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other protein targets that bind amide-containing ligands.
Step 3: The aromatic substituents and hydrophobic nature of the molecule may facilitate binding to membrane-bound receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 4: The presence of a ketone group (-CO-) and an ester group (-COOR) indicates possible enzyme inhibition, particularly towards cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 5: The overall structure and functional groups suggest potential interactions with multiple GPCRs and enzymes, implying a broad spectrum of potential gene targets including DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, PTGS1, SIGMAR1, and SLC6A4.
