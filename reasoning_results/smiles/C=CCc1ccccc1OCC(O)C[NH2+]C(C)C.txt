Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C=CCc1ccccc1OCC(O)C[NH2+]C(C)C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a benzene ring system with an aromatic double bond (C=CC) and a phenolic oxygen (O) attached to one of the rings. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in phase I metabolism such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom with a positive charge ([NH2+]) indicates that the molecule could be a potential ligand for receptors that interact with positively charged groups, such as some G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The molecule also contains a carboxyl group (OCC(O)) which can form hydrogen bonds and may interact with proteins containing amino acid residues like glutamate or aspartate, which are common in ion channels and receptors.
Step 4: Given the structure, the molecule might have affinity for receptors or enzymes associated with neurotransmitters and hormones, such as dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), and adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2).
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule's structure could suggest potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism and signaling pathways, such as CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and PTGS1 (COX-1/COX-2).
