Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COC(Cc1ccc(OCCc2nc(-c3ccccc3)oc2C)c2ccsc12)C(=O)[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with an oxygen atom attached (phenol group), which is common in ligands that can interact with receptors such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature may be relevant to GPCRs like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 2: The molecule also has a quinoline-like structure, which could potentially interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes like CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These enzymes are involved in the metabolism of various drugs.
Step 3: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in the molecule might indicate its ability to act as a ligand for certain receptors or ion channels, such as DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 4: The molecule's overall structure includes a coumarin-like moiety, which could be relevant to interactions with receptors or enzymes such as PTGS1 (cyclooxygenase).
Step 5: Given the diverse structural elements and potential interaction sites, the molecule could be related to multiple genes including: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, PTGS1.
