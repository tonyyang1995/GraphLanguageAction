Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(=O)OC(C)C[N+](C)(C)C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string CC(=O)OC(C)C[N+](C)(C)C has a structure that includes an amide group (-CO-N), a phenyl ring (C), and a positively charged nitrogen atom. This structure suggests that the molecule could be a small organic compound, likely an alkaloid or a derivative thereof.
Step 2: The positively charged nitrogen center in the molecule could indicate that it is a quaternary ammonium salt, which is often found in drugs targeting receptors or ion channels that have positively charged binding sites.
Step 3: Given the presence of a phenyl ring and the amide group, this molecule might interact with enzymes or receptors involved in neurotransmitter metabolism or signaling. For example, the CYP (cytochrome P450) family of enzymes, which are involved in drug metabolism, might be affected by this molecule due to its functional groups.
Step 4: The positively charged nitrogen could also suggest interactions with ion channels or receptors that have positively charged binding pockets, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This could include genes like DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, and others listed.
Step 5: Considering the potential for interaction with enzymes and receptors, the following genes are potentially related: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
Summary of related genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
