Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOc1ccccc1OCCCCCc1c(C)n[n-]c1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other type of explanation.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with multiple substituents including an amine group (-NH2), an alcohol group (-OH), and a phenolic oxygen (O). This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of aromatic rings and functional groups like the amine and phenolic oxygen indicates that this molecule could be a substrate for cytochrome P450 enzymes, specifically CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, which are known to metabolize drugs containing these features.
Step 3: The molecule also has a quinoline-like structure, which is a common feature in substrates for CYP3A4, another enzyme involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: Given the presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocycle and a benzene ring, the molecule might interact with receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B) and dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3).
Step 5: The overall structure does not strongly suggest direct interaction with other listed genes but may influence their expression through metabolic pathways involving the identified enzymes.
Summary of related gene names: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3.
