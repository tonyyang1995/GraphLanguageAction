Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1c([O-])cc([O-])c2c(=O)cc(-c3ccccc3)oc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple functional groups such as carbonyl (C=O), phenolic hydroxyl (-OH), and ether (-O-) functionalities. It also includes a cyclic structure with a negatively charged oxygen atom attached to it.
Step 2: The molecule's structure suggests potential interactions with receptors and enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways, neurotransmission, and drug metabolism. Specifically, the presence of a benzene ring and a carboxylic acid group might indicate involvement in mechanisms related to G-protein coupled receptors and ion channels.
Step 3: Considering the pharmacological properties of the molecule, it could potentially interact with genes encoding for receptors and enzymes that are known to be involved in neurotransmission and pain modulation, such as adrenergic and cholinergic receptors, and cytochrome P450 enzymes responsible for drug metabolism.
Step 4: The molecule's structure also indicates possible interaction with genes associated with G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathways, as evidenced by the presence of aromatic rings and polar functional groups. This suggests potential effects on genes like DRD2, DRD3, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which encode for various subtypes of dopamine and serotonin receptors.
Step 5: Furthermore, the molecule's ability to interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, may imply its relevance to genes involved in this process. Additionally, the presence of a carboxylic acid group suggests potential interactions with genes like PTGS1, which encodes for cyclooxygenase-1, an enzyme involved in prostaglandin synthesis.
