Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccccc1OCC(=O)[N-][N-]C(=O)c1cnccn1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with several aromatic rings, a hydroxyl group (-OH), and a nitroso group (N=O). These structural features suggest that the molecule could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction, neurotransmission, or drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of an aromatic ring and a nitroso group might indicate potential interactions with enzymes or receptors that have similar functional groups, such as those involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways or cytochrome P450 enzyme systems.
Step 3: Considering the GPCR family, the molecule may be related to receptors like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are known to bind ligands with similar functional groups for neurotransmitter or hormone binding.
Step 4: Alternatively, the molecule's structure suggests it might interact with enzymes involved in phase I metabolism, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are part of the cytochrome P450 superfamily.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and potential interactions, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. These genes encode proteins involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism. 
Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
