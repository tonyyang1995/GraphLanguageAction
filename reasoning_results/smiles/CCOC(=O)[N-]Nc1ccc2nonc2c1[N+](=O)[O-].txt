Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)[N-]Nc1ccc2nonc2c1[N+](=O)[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is an organic compound containing a benzene ring, a hydroxyl group, an amide, and a pyrrolidine ring. The presence of these functional groups suggests that it could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, particularly those containing amino acid binding sites or receptor-like domains.
Step 2: The benzene ring and amide group are common in many neurotransmitter receptors and enzymes, which are encoded by genes such as DRD2 (Dopamine Receptor D2), HTR1A (Serotonin Receptor 1A), and CYP2D6 (Cytochrome P450 2D6). These genes are known to be involved in the regulation of neurotransmission and drug metabolism.
Step 3: The hydroxyl group and pyrrolidine ring may also suggest potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, which are part of the cytochrome P450 family and play crucial roles in the metabolism of various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 4: Given the presence of a carboxamide group, the molecule might have affinity for ion channels or transporters, such as KDR (Kinase Insert Domain Receptor) or SLC6A4 (Solute Carrier Family 6 Member 4), which are encoded by genes involved in the regulation of ion fluxes and neurotransmitter reuptake.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule appears to be related to the following genes: DRD2, HTR1A, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, KDR, and SLC6A4. These genes are involved in neurotransmission, drug metabolism, and ion channel function, which are all relevant to the potential biological activities of the molecule.
