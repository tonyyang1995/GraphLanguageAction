Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(CCc1ccc([O-])cc1)c1c([O-])cc([O-])cc1[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains multiple aromatic rings, including a benzene ring attached to an oxygen atom (oxazole), and a furan ring. These structural features suggest potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of an oxygenated heterocycle (oxazole) and a negatively charged group (-O-) indicate possible binding to receptors that interact with ligands containing similar functional groups, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The molecule also has a quinoline-like structure, which could interact with enzymes like CYP2D6, known for metabolizing drugs containing similar functional groups.
Step 4: Given the potential for the molecule to interact with GPCRs and enzymes involved in drug metabolism, it may be related to genes such as CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule’s structure might interact with receptors like HTR2A and HTR2B, which are associated with neurotransmitter systems, leading to potential relationships with genes like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
Related genes: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
