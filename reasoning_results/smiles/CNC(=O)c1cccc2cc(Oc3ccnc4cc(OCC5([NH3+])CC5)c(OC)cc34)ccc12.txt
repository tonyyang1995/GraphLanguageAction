Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CNC(=O)c1cccc2cc(Oc3ccnc4cc(OCC5([NH3+])CC5)c(OC)cc34)ccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with a benzene ring fused to an imidazole ring, which is characteristic of many ligands that interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This suggests potential interactions with genes encoding GPCRs.
Step 2: The presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) and a quaternary ammonium cation ([NH3+]) in the molecule indicates it could be a ligand for receptors that recognize acidic and basic functional groups, such as muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.
Step 3: The molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring, which is known to interact with several types of receptors including dopamine receptors. This structural feature suggests possible interaction with genes encoding dopamine receptors like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
Step 4: The molecule also includes a pyrazole ring, which is often found in compounds that inhibit enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2D6 and CYP2C19. This indicates potential interactions with genes encoding cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Step 5: Based on the identified structural features, the molecule may be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2D6, and CYP2C19.
