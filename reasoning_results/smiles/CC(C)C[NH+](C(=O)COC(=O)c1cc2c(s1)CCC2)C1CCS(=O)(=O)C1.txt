Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)C[NH+](C(=O)COC(=O)c1cc2c(s1)CCC2)C1CCS(=O)(=O)C1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is common in many drugs that interact with receptors and enzymes. This structure suggests the molecule might interact with genes encoding for receptors or enzymes that have benzene rings as part of their structure or function.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a quinoline ring, which is known to be involved in interactions with various drug targets, particularly those related to neurotransmitter systems and enzyme activity. This indicates potential interaction with genes that encode proteins containing quinoline-like motifs or are involved in similar pathways.
Step 3: The presence of an acetyl group (-COCH3) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) suggests the molecule could act as an agonist or antagonist at receptor sites or inhibit certain enzymes. This implies a possible relationship with genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or enzymes such as cytochrome P450s (CYPs).
Step 4: Given the complexity and size of the molecule, it likely interacts with large protein complexes or multiple targets. This broad interaction profile could mean it affects a variety of genes involved in different biological processes, including signal transduction, cell signaling, and metabolic pathways.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is most likely to be related to genes encoding GPCRs, enzymes involved in metabolism, and possibly those involved in neurotransmission. Specific genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, PTGS1, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4.
