Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+](C)CCCSC(N)=[NH2+], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The SMILES string C[NH+](C)CCCSC(N)=[NH2+] describes a molecule that contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (N+), attached to a benzene ring and other substituents. This indicates the presence of an amine group and a positively charged nitrogen, which are common in molecules that interact with receptors or ion channels.
Step 2: The positively charged nitrogen suggests the molecule could interact with negatively charged sites on receptors or ion channels. Among the listed genes, those encoding for receptors or ion channels are ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, and SLC6A2.
Step 3: The benzene ring and other substituents in the molecule might allow it to interact with specific domains of these receptors or ion channels, particularly those involved in ligand binding. Genes encoding for these specific interactions include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and KCNH2.
Step 4: The positively charged nitrogen also suggests potential interaction with cation channels, making genes like KCNH2 (a potassium channel) and LCK (which may modulate ion channel function) relevant.
Step 5: Given the molecular structure and charge, the most likely related genes are those encoding for receptors and ion channels: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, and SLC6A2.
