Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])CCC(=O)Nc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)N=c2[n-]ccs2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule is a complex organic compound, specifically an aromatic heterocyclic amide with a carbonyl group and a sulfonamide moiety. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes or receptors that have binding sites for similar functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of a sulfonamide (S(=O)(=O)N) and a carboxylic acid (C(=O)N) group indicates that this molecule could interact with enzymes involved in metabolism such as cytochrome P450s (CYP enzymes), which are known to metabolize drugs and xenobiotics containing these functional groups.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a pyrrolidine ring (c1ccc(S(=O)(=O)N=c2[n-]ccs2)), which might be recognized by certain G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (MChRs) due to their ability to bind small molecules with similar shapes and polarities.
Step 4: Considering the presence of a benzene ring and a quinoline-like structure, it is possible that the molecule could interact with kinases, particularly those involved in signal transduction pathways, such as LCK (Lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase).
Step 5: Based on the above structural analysis, the molecule may be related to the following genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, LCK.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP1A2
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- CHRM1
- CHRM3
- CHRM4
- LCK Step 5: Summary of related gene names:
- LCK
These genes are likely to be affected by or interact with the molecule due to its structural features.
