Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+](C)C(=O)Oc1cc(OC(=O)[NH+](C)C)cc(C(O)C[NH2+]C(C)(C)C)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups, including an amide (C=O), an ester (C(=O)O), a primary amine (NH2), and a secondary amine (NH+). This structure suggests that it could be a drug-like compound targeting receptors or enzymes involved in signal transduction or metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a primary amine (NH2) and a secondary amine (NH+) indicates potential binding sites for proteins with complementary amino acid residues, such as histidine or arginine, which are common in receptor binding domains. This structural feature is particularly relevant for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other ion channels, which often have positively charged residues in their binding pockets.
Step 3: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is a common scaffold in many drugs, particularly those targeting GPCRs and ion channels. Benzene rings can form π-π stacking interactions with aromatic residues in protein binding sites, contributing to the binding affinity of the molecule.
Step 4: Given the presence of amide and ester functionalities, the molecule may interact with enzymes involved in metabolism or signaling pathways, such as CYP2D6, CYP2C19, or CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics. These enzymes could be directly targeted by the molecule or indirectly affected through allosteric modulation.
Step 5: Considering the molecular structure and its potential interactions with receptors and enzymes, the following genes are likely to be related to this molecule: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, ESR1, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, and HRH1. These genes encode proteins that could potentially bind or interact with the molecule, either directly or through downstream effects on cellular signaling pathways. Step 2: Summary of Related Genes:
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- ABL1
- CYP1A2
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- DRD2
- DRD3
- DRD4
- ESR1
- PTGS1
- SLC6A2
- SLC6A4
- HRH1
These genes encode proteins that could interact with the molecule either directly through binding or indirectly through their roles in signaling pathways and metabolism.
