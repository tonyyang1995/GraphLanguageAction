Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COC(=O)N(C)c1ccccc1C(=O)[NH+]1CCOCC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure containing an amide (C=O-N), a benzene ring (C6H5), a thiazole ring (C3H3NS), and a pyrrolidine ring (C5H7N). These structural features are characteristic of ligands that can interact with various receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The benzene ring and the amide group are common in molecules that can bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4). These receptors often have binding sites for ligands containing aromatic rings and amide groups.
Step 3: The presence of a thiazole ring suggests potential interaction with enzymes that have thiazole-containing substrates or inhibitors, such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are involved in drug metabolism. Additionally, the benzene ring and amide group might also interact with these enzymes' active sites.
Step 4: The pyrrolidine ring may be involved in interactions with other receptors or enzymes, but it is less likely to be directly related to the listed genes. However, it could potentially interact with proteins like HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are serotonin receptors, given their diverse ligand-binding capabilities.
Step 5: Given the molecular structure, the most likely related genes are those involved in GPCR signaling pathways and drug metabolism, specifically:
- GPCRs: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- Drug Metabolism: CYP2C9, CYP2C19
These genes are most relevant due to the presence of aromatic rings and amide groups in the molecule, which are key structural elements for binding to these types of proteins. Step 5: Summary of Related Genes:
- ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19. 
These genes are most likely to be influenced by the described molecule based on its chemical structure and known interactions with similar compounds. Other genes listed are less likely to be directly related based on the molecule's structure. Step 5: Summary of Related Genes:
These genes are most likely to be influenced by the molecule due to their involvement in receptor and enzyme functions corresponding to the molecule's structural features. Step 5: Summary of Related Genes:
- ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CH
