Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[N+](C)(C)CCCCCCCCCC[N+](C)(C)C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that has a central nitrogen atom with positive charge, attached to multiple carbon atoms. This structure suggests the molecule could be a derivative of an amine or an organic base, possibly acting as a ligand or inhibitor.
Step 2: The presence of multiple nitrogen atoms with positive charges (N+) indicates the molecule may have a cationic nature, which could influence its interaction with negatively charged sites on proteins, such as ion channels or receptors. This property is relevant to genes encoding for ion channels or receptors that interact with cations.
Step 3: Given the structure contains aromatic rings (as implied by the presence of benzene-like structures in the SMILES), the molecule might have affinity for proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, particularly those containing aromatic residues or being part of receptor-ligand interactions.
Step 4: Considering the molecule's potential to interact with ion channels or receptors due to its cationic nature and aromatic structures, it could potentially modulate the activity of genes involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction. This includes genes like HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4, which encode for various types of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule’s structure might also allow it to interact with enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs and endogenous compounds. Therefore, the molecule could influence the expression or function of these genes.
