Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])CSc1nnc(Br)n1-c1ccc(C2CC2)c2ccccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a structure that includes an aromatic ring system with a benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group (O=C) and a negatively charged oxygen atom (O-). This pattern suggests the molecule could be a ligand or inhibitor targeting receptors or enzymes that interact with such functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of a cyclic amine (c1nnc(Br)n1) in the molecule indicates it might interact with receptors that bind to amines, such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 3: The molecule also contains a benzothiazole ring (C2CC2), which is known to interact with certain G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) like the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CNR1) and serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Step 4: The presence of a quinoline-like structure (CSc1nnc(Br)n1) and a pyridine ring (C2CC2) may suggest interactions with enzymes or receptors that have similar binding sites, such as CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Step 5: Given the complex structure with multiple functional groups and potential binding sites, the molecule could be related to several genes involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmission, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CNR1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
