Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C=CCN=c1[n-]c(N)c(C(=O)c2ccc(OC)cc2)s1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound with a benzene ring, a nitrogen atom, and a sulfhydryl group (-s1), indicating potential reactivity and biological activity. The presence of an amide (C(=O)c2ccc(OC)cc2) and a cyano group (CN) suggests it could interact with enzymes or receptors that have corresponding binding sites.
Step 2: The molecule's structure includes a nitrile group (C#N) and a nitroso group ([n-]), which are known to form hydrogen bonds and can be recognized by certain protein structures, particularly those involved in neurotransmission and hormone binding.
Step 3: Given the pattern of functional groups and the presence of a cyano group and a nitroso group, this molecule might interact with enzymes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics. It could also potentially interact with G-protein coupled receptors such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are associated with dopamine signaling pathways.
Step 4: The molecule’s structure does not directly suggest interactions with kinases like LCK or receptor tyrosine kinases like KDR, nor does it have a typical ligand binding site for transcription factors like PPARG or HRH1.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and the above analysis, the related genes are likely to be involved in neurotransmission, drug metabolism, and possibly pain modulation. The related gene names include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- DRD2
- DRD3
- DRD4 Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring, a nitrogen atom, and a sulfhydryl group (-s1), indicating potential reactivity and biological activity.
Step 2: The presence of an amide and a cyano group suggests the molecule could interact with enzymes or receptors that have corresponding binding sites.
Step 3: The nitrile and nitroso groups indicate the molecule might interact with enzymes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, and G-protein coupled receptors such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
Step 4: The molecule lacks typical ligand binding sites for kinases like LCK or receptor tyrosine kinases like KDR.
Step 5: The related genes are likely involved in neurotransmission, drug metabolism, and pain modulation, including CYP2C9, CYP2C19, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
- DRD4
These genes are likely to be affected by the molecule due to its structural features and potential interactions.
