Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C=C(CC)C(=O)c1ccc(OCC(=O)[O-])c(Cl)c1Cl, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this relationship might be clinically relevant.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, specifically a phenylacetylene moiety (C=C), which is a common pharmacophore feature in many drugs. This structure can interact with various receptors and enzymes due to its aromatic nature.
Step 2: The molecule also includes an amide group (-C(=O)N), which is known to bind to several receptor types, including G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels. This functional group could potentially interact with genes encoding receptors such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a methyl ester (-OC(=O)CH3) suggests the molecule may have acidic properties and could interact with proton-sensing proteins or enzymes, possibly related to genes like PTGS1 (which encodes COX-1 and COX-2, enzymes involved in prostaglandin synthesis).
Step 4: The molecule has a halogenated moiety (Cl) attached to a benzene ring, which could contribute to its binding affinity and selectivity for certain targets. This feature might be relevant to genes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize a wide range of xenobiotics.
Step 5: Lastly, the molecule's overall structure, particularly the presence of multiple functional groups and its potential to form hydrogen bonds and other interactions, suggests it could interact with a variety of targets, including kinases and ion channels. This is relevant to genes like LCK, HTR2A, and KCNH2.
