Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC1(C)CC(Oc2ccc(-c3ccc(-c4cn[n-]c4)cc3[O-])nn2)CC(C)(C)[NH2+]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is characteristic of several drug classes that interact with receptors or enzymes. Notably, this structure is relevant to CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs.
Step 2: The molecule also has an amine group (-NH2) and a quinolone-like structure, which are features commonly found in compounds that interact with adrenergic and cholinergic receptors. This suggests potential interactions with genes encoding for adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and cholinergic receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of an aromatic ring and a nitro group could indicate a compound with potential dopaminergic activity, which might interact with dopamine receptors. Genes like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, encoding dopamine receptors, could be relevant.
Step 4: The molecule's overall structure includes functional groups that could interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This is particularly relevant to genes encoding for serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) and HRH1, which encodes a histamine receptor.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1. 
Summary List: CYP enzymes, Adrenergic receptors, Cholinergic receptors, Dopamine receptors, Serotonin receptors, Histamine receptor. Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1. 
Summary List: CYP enzymes, Adrenergic receptors, Cholinergic receptors, Dopamine receptors, Serotonin receptors, Histamine receptor. Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A,
