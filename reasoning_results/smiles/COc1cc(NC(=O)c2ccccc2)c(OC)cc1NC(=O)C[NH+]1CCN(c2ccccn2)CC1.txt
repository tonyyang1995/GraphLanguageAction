Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc(NC(=O)c2ccccc2)c(OC)cc1NC(=O)C[NH+]1CCN(c2ccccn2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple functional groups such as amide, ester, and aromatic rings. Notably, it includes a benzene ring with an amide group (-CONH-) and an ester group (-COO-), which are characteristic of many drug molecules that interact with receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of the amide and ester groups suggests potential interactions with enzymes like CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs. These enzymes catalyze the oxidation of various substrates, including amides and esters, making them relevant to the molecule's pharmacological profile.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule's structure may allow for interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). The presence of a benzene ring and a nitrogen atom could potentially align with the binding sites of GPCRs such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are known to bind to various ligands and modulate neurotransmitter signaling.
Step 4: Furthermore, the molecule's ability to interact with enzymes and receptors might influence its effect on genes involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways. For example, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which encode dopamine receptors, could be affected by the molecule due to its potential to modulate dopamine signaling through receptor activation or inhibition.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and the described interactions, the related genes include: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4. These genes are involved in the metabolism and signaling pathways that could be impacted by the molecule's pharmacological properties.
