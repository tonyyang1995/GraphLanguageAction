Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)[NH+]1CCC([NH2+]CCNC(=O)c2ccccc2C)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure featuring an amide group (-CO-NH-) and several aromatic rings, including benzene and pyrrole rings. The presence of these functional groups suggests that the molecule could be involved in interactions with proteins that have similar chemical functionalities.
Step 2: One of the key features of the molecule is the presence of a pyrrole ring attached to a benzene ring through a nitrogen atom, which is part of a larger substructure involving multiple alkyl chains and additional heteroatoms (nitrogen). This structural pattern is characteristic of certain ligands for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are known to bind to molecules with similar features.
Step 3: Given the complexity of the molecule and its potential to interact with GPCRs, we should consider genes associated with GPCR signaling pathways. Some of the genes listed, such as DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), HTR1A (serotonin receptor 1A), HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A), and HTR2B (serotonin receptor 2B), encode GPCRs that might be relevant.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure may also suggest interactions with enzymes or transporters due to the presence of amide groups and other polar functional groups. Genes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which code for cytochrome P450 enzymes, could be potentially related based on this feature.
Step 5: Based on the analysis of the molecule's structure and the potential interactions it might have, the related genes include: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Summary of related genes: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure featuring an amide group (-CO-NH-) and several aromatic rings, including benzene and pyrrole rings. The presence of these functional groups suggests that the molecule could be involved in interactions with proteins that have similar chemical functionalities.
Step 2: The pyrrole ring attached to a benzene ring through a nitrogen atom indicates a possible interaction with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: Considering the potential for interaction with GPCRs, the related genes include DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, and HTR2B, which encode dopamine and serotonin receptors.
Step 4: The presence of amide groups and polar functional groups suggests potential interactions with enzymes, particularly those involved in metabolism.
Step 5: Based on the analysis, the related genes are DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Summary of related genes: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6.
