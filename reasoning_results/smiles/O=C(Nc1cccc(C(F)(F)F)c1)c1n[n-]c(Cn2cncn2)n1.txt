Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Nc1cccc(C(F)(F)F)c1)c1n[n-]c(Cn2cncn2)n1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples or additional text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring fused to a benzene ring, which is characteristic of many ligands for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature suggests potential interactions with GPCRs.
Step 2: The presence of multiple fluorine atoms (-F) attached to the benzene ring could indicate a mechanism of action involving enzyme inhibition, particularly CYP enzymes. Fluorine substitution is common in drugs that inhibit CYP isoforms due to its stabilizing effect on transition states.
Step 3: The overall structure includes a quinoline-like moiety, which is often found in ligands for receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), given the presence of aromatic and amine functionalities.
Step 4: The molecule also has a pyridine ring system, which is commonly found in ligands for various receptors including serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) and adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2).
Step 5: Given the structural features, the molecule may interact with multiple GPCRs and enzymes, specifically ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
