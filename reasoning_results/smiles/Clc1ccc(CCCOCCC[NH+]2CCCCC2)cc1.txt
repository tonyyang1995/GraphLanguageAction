Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Clc1ccc(CCCOCCC[NH+]2CCCCC2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule containing multiple functional groups such as a chlorine atom, aromatic rings, and various hydrocarbon chains. The presence of an amide group (-CONH+) suggests the molecule may have pharmacological activity.
Step 2: The molecule includes a benzene ring (cyclohexane) with attached alkyl chains and an amide group that could potentially interact with proteins involved in neurotransmission or signaling pathways.
Step 3: Given the presence of the amide group and the overall structure, this molecule might be capable of binding to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are often targeted by drugs affecting neurotransmission. GPCRs are involved in various signaling pathways and are encoded by genes such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
Step 4: Additionally, the complex structure with multiple functional groups and aromatic rings could also suggest potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes include: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4.
Summary of Related Genes: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4.
