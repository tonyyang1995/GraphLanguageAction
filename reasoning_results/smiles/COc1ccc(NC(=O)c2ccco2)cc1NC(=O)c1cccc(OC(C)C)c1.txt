Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(NC(=O)c2ccco2)cc1NC(=O)c1cccc(OC(C)C)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a tricyclic structure with a central nitrogen atom that is part of a pyrrolidine ring, which is connected to a benzene ring. This structure is common in molecules that interact with neurotransmitter receptors. The presence of a nitrogen atom within the ring suggests potential interactions with receptors that have basic sites for ligand binding.
Step 2: The molecule also includes an amide group (N-C=O), which is often involved in forming hydrogen bonds with receptor proteins. This feature could contribute to the molecule's ability to bind to and modulate the activity of certain receptors.
Step 3: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) might indicate the molecule has acidic properties, which could influence its pharmacokinetics and potential for ion channel modulation. However, this feature alone does not directly suggest a specific gene relationship without further context.
Step 4: Considering the overall structure and functional groups, the molecule appears to be a complex ligand that could potentially interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and possibly ion channels. GPCRs are associated with several of the listed genes, such as DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), HTR1A (serotonin receptor 1A), HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A), and HRH1 (histamine receptor H1). Ion channels like KCNH2 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2) and LCK (Lck, tyrosine kinase) may also be relevant due to their roles in cellular signaling pathways.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and potential interactions, the most likely related genes from the provided list include: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HRH1, KCNH2, and LCK.
