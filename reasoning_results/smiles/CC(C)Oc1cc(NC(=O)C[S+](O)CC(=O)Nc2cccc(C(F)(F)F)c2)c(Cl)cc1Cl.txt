Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)Oc1cc(NC(=O)C[S+](O)CC(=O)Nc2cccc(C(F)(F)F)c2)c(Cl)cc1Cl, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this relationship is significant.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with multiple substituents, including a chloroalkyl group and a trifluoromethyl group. These structural features suggest potential interactions with enzymes and receptors involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a cyanoacrylate moiety (-CN) and a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) indicates that the molecule may act as a ligand for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as adrenergic and cholinergic receptors. This is supported by the presence of substituents like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4 in the provided list of genes.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a pyridine ring and a pyrimidine ring, which are known to interact with DNA-binding proteins and transcription factors. This could imply a potential interaction with genes involved in cell signaling and regulation, such as CACNA1H and PTGS1.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule has a thioether group (-S-) attached to a benzene ring, which can form hydrogen bonds and other interactions with nucleic acids and proteins. This structural feature might be relevant to genes involved in signal transduction and receptor function, such as HRH1 and HTR1A.
Step 5: Based on the identified structural features and their potential interactions, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CACNA1H, PTGS1, HRH1, and HTR1A. These genes are involved in various aspects of signal transduction and receptor function.
