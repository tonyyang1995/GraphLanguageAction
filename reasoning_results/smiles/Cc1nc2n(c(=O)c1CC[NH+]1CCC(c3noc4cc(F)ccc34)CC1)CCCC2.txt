Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1nc2n(c(=O)c1CC[NH+]1CCC(c3noc4cc(F)ccc34)CC1)CCCC2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is common in many drug-like molecules and can interact with various receptors and enzymes. This structure might suggest potential interactions with genes encoding proteins that bind or metabolize benzene-containing compounds.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a quinoline ring (quinolin-8-one), which is known to have affinity for certain G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Specifically, this could indicate potential interaction with genes encoding GPCRs such as DRD2, HTR1A, and HTR2A, which are involved in neurotransmission.
Step 3: The presence of a pyridine ring and amide functionalities suggests possible interactions with genes involved in metabolism pathways, such as those encoding cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are responsible for metabolizing drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 4: The overall molecular complexity and functional groups present may also suggest potential interactions with genes encoding ion channels and transporters, such as KCNH2 (a potassium channel) and SLC6A4 (a serotonin transporter).
Step 5: Based on the structural features identified, the molecule is most likely to be related to the following genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, KCNH2, SLC6A4. 
Summary of related genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, KCNH2, SLC6A4.
