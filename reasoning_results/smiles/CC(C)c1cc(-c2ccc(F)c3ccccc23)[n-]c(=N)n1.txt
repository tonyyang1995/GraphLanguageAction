Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a phenyl ring and a nitrogen atom with a negative charge, which suggests it may interact with receptors that have similar functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of fluorine atoms (-F) indicates potential interactions with proteins that recognize halogenated compounds, such as certain G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The molecule also includes a pyrrolidine ring and an amide group, which could indicate potential interactions with enzymes like CYP2D6, known for metabolizing drugs containing similar functional groups.
Step 4: Given the complexity and specific functional groups, this molecule might interact with multiple genes involved in neurotransmitter signaling and receptor activity.
Step 5: Based on the structural features, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2D6, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
