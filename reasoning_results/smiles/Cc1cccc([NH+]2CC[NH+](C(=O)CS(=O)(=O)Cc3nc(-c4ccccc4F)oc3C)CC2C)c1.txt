Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cccc([NH+]2CC[NH+](C(=O)CS(=O)(=O)Cc3nc(-c4ccccc4F)oc3C)CC2C)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other type of explanation.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with a quaternary ammonium group attached to it. This suggests potential interactions with receptors that have positively charged binding sites, such as adrenergic and cholinergic receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an ester group (-COOR) indicates the molecule could be an inhibitor or substrate for enzymes involved in metabolism, such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes.
Step 3: The molecule also has a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), which is known to interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4).
Step 4: Given the presence of multiple functional groups and the overall size and shape of the molecule, it may interact with multiple targets including kinases (e.g., LCK, CDK2) and transporters (e.g., SLC6A2, SLC6A4).
Step 5: Based on the structural features identified, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes involved in neurotransmitter signaling, drug metabolism, and receptor interactions, specifically: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CNR1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, PTGS1, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4. Step 5: Related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CNR1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, PTGS1, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
