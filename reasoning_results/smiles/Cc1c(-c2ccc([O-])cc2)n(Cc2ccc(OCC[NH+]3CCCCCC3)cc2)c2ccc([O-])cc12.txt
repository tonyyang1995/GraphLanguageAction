Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1c(-c2ccc([O-])cc2)n(Cc2ccc(OCC[NH+]3CCCCCC3)cc2)c2ccc([O-])cc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains multiple aromatic rings and heteroatoms such as oxygen and nitrogen, suggesting it may interact with receptors that bind small molecules or have binding sites for such functional groups. 
Step 2: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) and amine functionalities indicate potential interactions with enzymes or transporters involved in metabolism or drug transport. This could relate to genes like CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and ABCB1 which are involved in drug metabolism and transport.
Step 3: The molecule also has a phenolic hydroxyl group (O-H) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which could interact with ion channels or receptors that bind acidic compounds. This might connect to genes like KCNH2, which encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel.
Step 4: The overall size and shape of the molecule suggest it could potentially fit into the binding pockets of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Genes associated with GPCRs include DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, and ESR1, among others.
Step 5: Considering the above structural features, the molecule is likely to be related to the genes: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, ABCB1, KCNH2, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, and ESR1.
