Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with multiple fluorine atoms (F) attached to carbon atoms, forming several rings including a benzene ring and a pyrrole ring. Additionally, there are oxygen atoms (O) and nitrogen atoms (N) involved in the molecule's structure.
Step 2: The presence of fluorine atoms (F) suggests that this molecule could be a fluorinated compound, which often interacts with proteins and enzymes involved in drug metabolism. This could imply a relationship with genes encoding enzymes responsible for metabolizing drugs, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to be involved in the metabolism of various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: The molecule also contains an amide group (-CONH-) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which can form hydrogen bonds and other interactions with proteins. This structural feature might suggest a relationship with genes encoding receptors or transporters that interact with molecules through hydrogen bonding, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, and HRH1.
Step 4: The molecule includes a pyrrole ring, which is known to participate in various biological processes due to its aromatic nature. This could indicate a relationship with genes encoding proteins that interact with aromatic compounds, such as PTGS1 (encoding cyclooxygenase-1, COX-1), which is involved in the biosynthesis of prostaglandins.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule appears to have potential interactions with several genes, including CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, HRH1, and PTGS1. These genes are involved in drug metabolism, receptor signaling, and prostaglandin biosynthesis.
