Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=S(=O)(c1cccc2cnccc12)[NH+]1CC[NH2+]CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a thioether moiety (S=O) and a nitrile group (-CN), which are common functional groups in ligands that interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The presence of these groups suggests potential interaction with GPCRs.
Step 2: The molecule also contains an amide group (-CONH2) and an amine group (-NH2), which can form hydrogen bonds and other interactions with amino acid residues in the receptor binding site. These functional groups are often involved in the binding and activation of GPCRs.
Step 3: Given the presence of these functional groups and their potential to interact with GPCRs, we can infer that the molecule might have affinity for receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), as these receptors commonly bind small molecules containing similar functional groups.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule may interact with receptors involved in neurotransmitter systems, such as dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), due to the presence of amine groups that can engage in binding with these receptors.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis and the potential interactions with GPCRs, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4.
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4. Step 1: The molecule contains a thioether moiety (S=O) and a nitrile group (-CN), suggesting potential interaction with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 2: The amide group (-CONH2) and amine group (-NH2) in the molecule can form hydrogen bonds and other interactions with amino acid residues in the receptor binding site.
Step 3: Considering the functional groups present, the molecule may interact with adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Step 4: The molecule could also bind to dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4) due to the amine groups.
Step 5: Based on the analysis, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2
