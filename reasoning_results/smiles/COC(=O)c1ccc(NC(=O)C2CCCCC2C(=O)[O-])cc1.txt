Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COC(=O)c1ccc(NC(=O)C2CCCCC2C(=O)[O-])cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex molecule that includes a benzene ring, an amide group, and a thiazole ring. This structure suggests the molecule could be a derivative of a compound like a benzodiazepine or a similar heterocyclic compound. Benzodiazepines are known to interact with various neurotransmitter systems in the brain, particularly those involving GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), which is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter.
Step 2: Given the presence of the amide group and the thiazole ring, this molecule likely has pharmacological activity related to its ability to modulate neurotransmission. Amides are common functional groups in drugs that act on receptors such as GABAA receptors, which are activated by GABA and inhibited by benzodiazepines. Thiazoles are also found in several psychoactive compounds.
Step 3: Considering the pattern of the molecule and its potential interactions with neurotransmitter systems, it is plausible that this molecule might have an effect on receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission pathways. Specific genes associated with neurotransmitter systems include those encoding receptors for GABA, dopamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine, as well as enzymes involved in the metabolism of these neurotransmitters.
Step 4: Among the listed genes, those directly related to neurotransmitter systems and their regulation include HTR1A (serotonin receptor), HTR2A (serotonin receptor), HTR2B (serotonin receptor), HTR2C (serotonin receptor), DRD2 (dopamine receptor), DRD3 (dopamine receptor), DRD4 (dopamine receptor), CHRM1 (acetylcholine receptor), CHRM3 (acetylcholine receptor), CHRM4 (acetylcholine receptor), and CNR1 (cannabinoid receptor).
Step 5: The molecule described in the SMILES string is likely to interact with one or more of the genes encoding neurotransmitter receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission pathways, particularly those related to GABA, serotonin, dopamine, and acetylcholine systems.
