Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: OCCCN=c1cc(-c2cc[n-]c(=Nc3cccc(Cl)c3)n2)cc[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains several aromatic rings, including benzene rings, which are common in many drugs and can interact with various receptors and enzymes. The presence of nitrogen atoms, particularly in a heterocyclic ring (indicated by the "n" symbol), suggests potential for interactions with ion channels or neurotransmitter receptors.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a cyano group (-CN) and a nitro group (-NO2), both of which are known to have strong electrophilic reactivity and can participate in covalent binding to proteins, including enzymes such as those involved in drug metabolism. This could potentially affect genes involved in drug metabolism pathways.
Step 3: The presence of a nitrile group (-C#N) and a quaternary ammonium group ([n-]) indicates that the molecule may have amphiphilic properties, allowing it to interact with cell membranes or serve as a ligand for membrane-bound receptors. This could be relevant to genes involved in receptor signaling pathways.
Step 4: Considering the structure of the molecule and its functional groups, it is likely to interact with enzymes involved in phase I and phase II metabolic processes, such as CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). It might also interact with ion channels (CACNA1H, KCNH2) due to the presence of aromatic rings and nitrogen-containing heterocycles.
Step 5: Given the potential interactions with enzymes and receptors, the following genes are likely to be related to this molecule: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CACNA1H, KCNH2. These genes encode enzymes and ion channels that could be directly affected by the molecule's structure and properties. 
Summary of Related Genes:
- CYP1A2
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- CACNA1H
- KCNH2 Step 5: Summary of Related Genes:
