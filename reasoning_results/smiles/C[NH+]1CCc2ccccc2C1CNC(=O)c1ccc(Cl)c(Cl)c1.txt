Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+]1CCc2ccccc2C1CNC(=O)c1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring system with a positively charged nitrogen atom, which is part of the amide group. This structural feature suggests that the molecule could interact with receptors that have a binding site for amides or positively charged amino groups.
Step 2: The molecule also has a benzene ring with multiple substituents (chlorine atoms), which might indicate it can act as a ligand for receptors that have hydrophobic binding sites or are sensitive to aromatic compounds.
Step 3: Among the listed genes, several are known to be involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4. These receptors often bind small molecules with similar structural features to those found in the provided molecule.
Step 4: The presence of a carboxamide group in the molecule, which is characteristic of many inhibitors and agonists of enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, suggests potential interactions with these genes' encoded enzymes, which play roles in drug metabolism.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structural features and its potential interactions with the listed genes, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, CNR1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4. 
Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, CNR1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4.
