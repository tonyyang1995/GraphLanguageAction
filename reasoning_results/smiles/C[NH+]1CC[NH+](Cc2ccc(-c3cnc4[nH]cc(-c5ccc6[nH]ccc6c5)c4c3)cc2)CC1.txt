Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+]1CC[NH+](Cc2ccc(-c3cnc4[nH]cc(-c5ccc6[nH]ccc6c5)c4c3)cc2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (N+), which suggests it is an amine compound with a quaternary ammonium group. This structure is often found in drugs that interact with receptors or transport proteins.
Step 2: The molecule includes several aromatic rings and heteroatoms such as nitrogen and oxygen, indicating potential for hydrogen bonding and aromatic interactions. These types of interactions are crucial for the binding of many drugs to their target proteins.
Step 3: Given the presence of aromatic rings and charged groups, this molecule could potentially interact with ion channels, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), and enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYPs). Specific examples include GPCRs involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways, and CYP enzymes responsible for drug metabolism.
Step 4: Considering the molecular features, the most likely related genes would be those encoding receptors and enzymes that might interact directly or indirectly with this molecule. For instance, genes encoding GPCRs (such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) and CYP enzymes (like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) are strong candidates due to their known roles in neurotransmission and drug metabolism.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. These genes encode receptors and enzymes that could be targets or affected by the molecule described by the given SMILES string.
