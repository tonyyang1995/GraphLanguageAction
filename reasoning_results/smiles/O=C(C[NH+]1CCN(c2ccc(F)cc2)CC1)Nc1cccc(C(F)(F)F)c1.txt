Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(C[NH+]1CCN(c2ccc(F)cc2)CC1)Nc1cccc(C(F)(F)F)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains several functional groups such as amide (-CONH), ester (-COO), and aromatic rings (cyclohexane-like structures). These functional groups are typically involved in interactions with proteins, particularly enzymes and receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the amide group and a positively charged amine (NH+) suggests that this molecule could interact with ion channels, receptors, or transporters that have amino acid binding sites. This is relevant to genes encoding for receptors or ion channels.
Step 3: The molecule also has fluorine atoms attached to aromatic rings, which can form hydrogen bonds and stabilize protein-ligand interactions through electrostatic interactions. This structural feature is significant for genes involved in drug metabolism and transport.
Step 4: Given the pattern of the molecule and its potential interactions, it is likely to be related to genes involved in neurotransmitter signaling, receptor binding, and drug metabolism. This narrows down the related genes to those involved in these processes.
Step 5: Based on the analysis, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, and SIGMAR1.
