Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC[NH+]1CC(CC[NH+]2CCOCC2)C(c2ccccc2)(c2ccccc2)C1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains several aromatic rings, including benzene rings, which are common in many drug-like molecules. This suggests that the molecule may interact with proteins that have binding sites for aromatic compounds, such as receptors or transporters.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-NHCO-) and an ester group (-COO-) indicates potential interactions with enzymes or receptors that recognize these functional groups. These functional groups could be involved in binding to proteins like cholinergic receptors (e.g., CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4) or G-protein coupled receptors (e.g., ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2).
Step 3: The molecule also has a quaternary ammonium group (+NH3), which can form hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions. Such interactions are relevant for ligands of ion channels (e.g., KCNH2) and receptors (e.g., HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C).
Step 4: The overall structure and functional groups suggest that this molecule might interact with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, given their role in metabolizing drugs containing similar functional groups.
Step 5: Considering the identified interactions and the presence of specific functional groups, the related genes include: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, KCNH2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. These genes encode proteins that are potential targets or affected by the molecule due to its structural and functional characteristics.
