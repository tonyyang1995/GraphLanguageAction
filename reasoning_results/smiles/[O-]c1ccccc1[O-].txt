Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [O-]c1ccccc1[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this relationship might be important.
Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string [O-]c1ccccc1[O-] is a benzene ring system with two negatively charged oxygen atoms attached to it. This structure suggests potential interactions with molecules that have specific binding sites for aromatic compounds or negatively charged groups.
Step 2: The negatively charged oxygen atoms in the molecule could potentially interact with positively charged regions of proteins or other molecules, which may be found in the transmembrane domains of certain receptors or ion channels.
Step 3: Given the presence of a benzene ring, the molecule might have affinity for enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize aromatic compounds.
Step 4: The molecule's structure also hints at possible interactions with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly those involved in neurotransmission, such as HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and DRD2, due to the presence of charged functional groups.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the related genes are likely to be involved in neurotransmission, drug metabolism, and receptor signaling. The list of related genes includes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2. Step 5: Summary of related gene names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2.
