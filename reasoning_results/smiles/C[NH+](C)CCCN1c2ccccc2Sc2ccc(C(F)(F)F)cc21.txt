Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+](C)CCCN1c2ccccc2Sc2ccc(C(F)(F)F)cc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this information might be useful.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (N+), indicating it could act as a basic compound that may interact with acidic residues on proteins. This structural feature is relevant to receptors like HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are known to have acidic amino acid residues that can form hydrogen bonds with basic compounds.
Step 2: The molecule also includes multiple aromatic rings, specifically benzene rings, which are common in many receptor ligands. These aromatic groups can form hydrophobic interactions with transmembrane domains of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Therefore, the molecule could potentially interact with receptors such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4, which all have transmembrane domains rich in aromatic amino acids.
Step 3: The presence of fluorine atoms (F) in the molecule suggests it could have specific interactions with enzymes or receptors that recognize fluorinated compounds. CYP2C19 and CYP2C9, both involved in metabolizing drugs and xenobiotics, might be particularly sensitive to the fluorinated substituents due to their ability to form strong hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions.
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule, with its central core and multiple substituents, indicates it could be a complex ligand that binds to multiple sites on a protein. This complexity might allow it to modulate the activity of multiple receptors and enzymes, including DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, and PTGS1, which are involved in various signaling pathways and drug metabolism.
Step 5: Considering the molecular structure and its potential interactions with proteins, the related genes include: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, PTGS1. These genes encode receptors and enzymes that could be directly or indirectly affected by the molecule's structure and chemical properties. Step 1: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
Step 2: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4
Step 3: CYP2C19, CYP2C9
Step 4: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, PTGS1
Step 5: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, PTGS1
