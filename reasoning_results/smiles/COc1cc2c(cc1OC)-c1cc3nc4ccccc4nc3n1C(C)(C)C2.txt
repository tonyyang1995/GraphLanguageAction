Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc2c(cc1OC)-c1cc3nc4ccccc4nc3n1C(C)(C)C2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a complex structure including a benzene ring, an oxetane ring, and several heteroatoms such as oxygen and nitrogen. These structural features are characteristic of molecules that interact with receptors and enzymes involved in signal transduction and metabolism.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of a benzene ring and heteroatoms suggests the molecule may have the ability to bind to or modulate the activity of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are often associated with neurotransmitters and hormones. This is because many drugs targeting GPCRs contain aromatic rings and heteroatoms for binding interactions.
Step 3: The molecule's structure also indicates potential interaction with cytochrome P450 enzymes, specifically CYP2D6 and CYP2C9, due to the presence of functional groups such as hydroxyls and carbonyls that could serve as substrates for these enzymes. These enzymes play crucial roles in drug metabolism.
Step 4: Given the complexity of the molecule and its potential interactions with both GPCRs and CYP enzymes, it is likely to influence pathways involving neurotransmission and metabolism, which are regulated by genes like HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and CYP2D6/CYP2C9.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and potential interactions, the related genes include: HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and CYP2D6, CYP2C9. These genes are involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism, respectively.
