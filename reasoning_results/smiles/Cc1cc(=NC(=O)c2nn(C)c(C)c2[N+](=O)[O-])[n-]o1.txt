Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc(=NC(=O)c2nn(C)c(C)c2[N+](=O)[O-])[n-]o1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple functional groups such as amide (N-C=O), aromatic ring (c1cc), nitroso (N[O-]), and amine (N+). These functional groups suggest the molecule could be involved in interactions with proteins that have similar chemical functionalities.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group suggests this molecule might interact with enzymes or receptors that have amide binding sites. Examples include CYP2D6, which metabolizes many drugs through oxidation reactions involving amides, and HTR2A, which binds various neurotransmitters including serotonin, a class of molecules often containing amide bonds.
Step 3: The nitroso group in the molecule may indicate it could interact with proteins that contain metal ions, such as ion channels. CNR1, which encodes the cannabinoid receptor, has a role in signaling pathways that might involve metal ions due to its function in lipid signaling.
Step 4: The aromatic rings in the molecule suggest potential interactions with proteins that recognize aromatic motifs, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, and ABL1. These receptors are known to bind to a variety of ligands that include aromatic compounds.
Step 5: Given the complexity and specific functional groups, the molecule is likely to interact with several genes involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmission, and signal transduction. Based on the analysis, the related genes are: CYP2D6, HTR2A, CNR1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, and ABL1.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2D6
- HTR2A
- CNR1
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- ABL1 Step 5: Summary of related gene names:
- ABL1
These genes are associated with drug metabolism, neurotransmission, and signal transduction based on the molecular features of the given compound.
