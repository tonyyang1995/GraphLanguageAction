Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(=O)[NH+]1CCN(c2ccc(OCC3COC(Cn4ccnc4)(c4ccc(Cl)cc4Cl)O3)cc2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a molecule that contains a carboxamide group (-CONH) and an amide group (-CON), which are characteristic of compounds that can interact with various receptors and transporters. The presence of these functional groups suggests that the molecule could potentially modulate the activity of proteins involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a phenyl ring system, which is a common structural motif for drugs that target G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). The phenyl rings are typically involved in binding to the extracellular domains of these receptors through hydrophobic interactions.
Step 3: Given the potential for interaction with GPCRs, several genes listed here are related to such receptors. For instance, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and HRH1 encode for different subtypes of adrenergic and cholinergic receptors, all of which are GPCRs. Additionally, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 encode for serotonin receptors, another class of GPCRs.
Step 4: Furthermore, the molecule’s structure might suggest interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism. CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are cytochrome P450 enzymes that play a significant role in the metabolism of many drugs, including this one. These enzymes are known to catalyze the oxidation of various substrates, which could include the amide and carboxamide functionalities present in the molecule.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the related genes are likely to be those encoding for GPCRs and enzymes involved in drug metabolism. Specifically, the related gene names are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Summary of Related Genes:
- GPCR-related: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- Metabolism-related: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6
