Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C(O)c1ccc([O-])cc1)[NH+]1CCC(Cc2ccccc2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure including a benzene ring, an oxygen-containing functional group, and a positively charged nitrogen atom. This suggests the molecule could interact with proteins that have similar functional groups or binding sites.
Step 2: The positively charged nitrogen and the oxygen-containing functional group indicate potential for interaction with proteins that have acidic or basic residues for binding, such as ion channels or receptors.
Step 3: The presence of a benzene ring and alkyl chains might suggest interactions with membrane proteins or enzymes involved in lipid metabolism.
Step 4: Given the complexity and the presence of a negatively charged oxygen (from the [O-] group), this molecule could potentially bind to proteins involved in signal transduction pathways or receptor-ligand interactions.
Step 5: Considering the molecular features and their potential interactions, the related genes might include those encoding ion channels, receptors, and signaling proteins. Specifically, these could be: ABL1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
