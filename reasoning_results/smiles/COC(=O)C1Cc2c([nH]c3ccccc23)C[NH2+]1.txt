Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COC(=O)C1Cc2c([nH]c3ccccc23)C[NH2+]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that is a derivative of the amino acid cysteine, specifically a thioether compound with a carboxylic acid group and a substituted phenyl ring. This structure is characteristic of many ligands for nuclear receptors and other signaling molecules.
Step 2: The molecule contains a phenyl ring and a carboxamide group, which are common features in ligands for nuclear receptors such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. These enzymes are involved in the metabolism of various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a nitrogen atom in the amide group suggests potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Among the listed genes, this could be relevant to DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which encode dopamine receptors, and HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode serotonin receptors.
Step 4: The overall structure also includes a basic amine group (-NH2+), which might interact with ion channels like KCNH2, but no direct evidence from the provided information points to a strong interaction.
Step 5: Considering the above structural features, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and neurotransmission (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
