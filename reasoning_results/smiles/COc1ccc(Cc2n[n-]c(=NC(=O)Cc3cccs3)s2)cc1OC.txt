Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(Cc2n[n-]c(=NC(=O)Cc3cccs3)s2)cc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure containing a benzene ring system, a pyrrole ring, and several substituents such as a carboxamide group, a nitrile group, and a phenyl group. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH2) and a nitrile group (-CN) indicates that this molecule could be metabolized by CYP (cytochrome P450) enzymes, specifically CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are known to metabolize drugs containing similar functional groups.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH), which could potentially interact with esterases or other enzymes involved in the metabolism of phenolic compounds. This feature might be relevant to CYP2D6, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of a wide range of substrates including some drugs.
Step 4: Considering the overall structure and the presence of functional groups that can be recognized by enzymes, the molecule may have a relationship with multiple genes involved in drug metabolism, particularly CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
These genes are primarily involved in the metabolism of the molecule through enzymatic processes. Other genes listed do not appear to have a direct structural or functional relationship with the given molecule based on its SMILES representation. However, it's important to note that biological activity and interaction can sometimes be more complex than structural similarity alone. Further experimental validation would be needed to confirm any biological effects.
