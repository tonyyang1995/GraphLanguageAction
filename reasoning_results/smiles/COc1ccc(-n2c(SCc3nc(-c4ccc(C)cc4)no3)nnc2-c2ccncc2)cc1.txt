Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(-n2c(SCc3nc(-c4ccc(C)cc4)no3)nnc2-c2ccncc2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings, including a benzene ring and a pyrrole ring, which are common in many drug molecules. This complexity suggests that the molecule may interact with proteins involved in cellular signaling pathways or transport mechanisms.
Step 2: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) and a sulfonyl group (SO2) in the molecule indicates potential electrophilic reactivity and the ability to form covalent bonds with proteins. Such reactive groups can be recognized by enzymes like CYP enzymes, which are involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics and drugs.
Step 3: The molecule contains an amine group (-NH2), which could participate in hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions with receptors or transporters. This feature is particularly relevant for genes encoding receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and G-protein coupled receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Step 4: The molecule also includes a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which can form hydrogen bonds and ester or amide linkages. This functionality might be important for interactions with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, such as kinases (CDK2) or G-protein coupled receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Step 5: Given the overall structure and functional groups, this molecule is likely to interact with several genes involved in drug metabolism, receptor binding, and signaling pathways, including: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CDK2, and LCK.
