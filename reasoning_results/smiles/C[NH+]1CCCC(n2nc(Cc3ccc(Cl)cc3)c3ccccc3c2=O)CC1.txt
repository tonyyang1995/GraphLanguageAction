Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+]1CCCC(n2nc(Cc3ccc(Cl)cc3)c3ccccc3c2=O)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (N+), which suggests the presence of an amine group that has been protonated. This feature indicates the molecule could be an alkaloid or a derivative of such compounds, often found in natural products with biological activity.
Step 2: The molecule also includes multiple aromatic rings, particularly benzene rings, which are common in many pharmacologically active molecules due to their ability to form stable structures and interact with proteins. Notably, it contains a naphthyl group (n2nc(...)) attached to a pyrrole ring, which can contribute to its structural complexity and potential for interaction with receptors or enzymes.
Step 3: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a carbonyl group (c3ccccc3) suggests the molecule might have acidic or basic functional groups capable of forming hydrogen bonds or other types of interactions with proteins. These functional groups are important for binding to receptors or enzymes, potentially modulating their activity.
Step 4: Given the structural features mentioned, the molecule likely interacts with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, neurotransmitter systems, and inflammation, as these processes often involve proteins with binding sites for small molecules. Specific examples include G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), enzymes like cytochrome P450s, and ion channels.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule may be related to several genes involved in these pathways, including but not limited to: CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A, HTR2B, PTGS1, and SLC6A4. These genes encode enzymes and transporters that play crucial roles in drug metabolism, neurotransmission, and inflammatory responses.
