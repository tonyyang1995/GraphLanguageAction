Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC[NH+]1CCN(c2cc3c(cc2F)c(=O)c(C(=O)[O-])cn3C2CC2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (NH+), which suggests it may act as a basic compound. This feature is relevant to receptors that bind basic ligands, such as certain G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 2: The molecule also has several aromatic rings, which are common in compounds that can interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, including those encoded by genes like CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which encode enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The presence of a carboxyl group (-COOH) and an amide (-CONH-) indicates the molecule could potentially interact with ion channels or receptors that have acidic residues, such as HTR2A, which encodes the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor.
Step 4: The molecule's overall structure, with multiple functional groups, suggests it could be a substrate for enzymes involved in phase I metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C19 and CYP2C9.
Step 5: Considering the above structural features, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, HTR2A, and possibly other genes involved in signal transduction and neurotransmitter systems.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- HTR2A
These genes are involved in metabolic processes and neurotransmission, which align with the molecular features of the described compound. Other genes not listed here might also be relevant depending on additional details about the molecule's pharmacological profile.
