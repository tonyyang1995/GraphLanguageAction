Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+]1CCN(c2c(F)cc3c(=O)c(C(=O)[O-])cn(CCF)c3c2F)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring, which is part of the amide group attached to an aromatic ring system. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins that have similar chemical motifs, such as receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of fluorine atoms (F) in the molecule, particularly in the trifluoromethyl group, indicates a possible interaction with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by the CYP family of genes. CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 are known to be involved in metabolizing drugs with similar functional groups.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a benzene ring system, which could interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are often targets for drugs due to their role in signal transduction pathways. Genes like DRD2, HTR2A, and HTR2B encode for GPCRs that may be influenced by this structural feature.
Step 4: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and its ester derivative (c2c(F)cc3c(=O)c(C(=O)[O-])) suggests potential interactions with enzymes that catalyze reactions involving these functional groups, such as esterases and carboxypeptidases. Genes like CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 are involved in the metabolism of compounds with these functional groups.
Step 5: The overall structure of the molecule, including the amide, aromatic rings, and polar functional groups, may influence its ability to bind to various receptors and transport proteins. Genes such as ABCB1, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4 encode transporters and channels that may be affected by this molecule's structure.
