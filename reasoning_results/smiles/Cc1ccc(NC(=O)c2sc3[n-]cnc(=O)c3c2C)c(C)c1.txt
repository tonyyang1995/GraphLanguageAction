Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(NC(=O)c2sc3[n-]cnc(=O)c3c2C)c(C)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure containing several functional groups including an amide (N-C=O), a pyrrole ring (indicated by the nitrogen atom within a five-membered ring), and aromatic rings (indicated by the double bonds and benzene rings). These features suggest that the molecule may have interactions with proteins involved in signal transduction and receptor binding.
Step 2: Among the provided genes, several are known to encode for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) which typically bind ligands and then activate intracellular signaling pathways. The presence of a potential ligand-binding site due to the amide group and aromatic rings could be relevant to these receptors. Specifically, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C all encode for GPCRs.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule contains a pyrrole ring, which could potentially interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism. Genes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 are known to encode for cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are crucial for the metabolism of many drugs.
Step 4: The presence of a nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring (pyrrole) and the overall structure of the molecule might also indicate a potential interaction with ion channels or transporters. Genes such as KCNH2 (encoding a voltage-gated potassium channel) and SLC6A4 (encoding a sodium-dependent neurotransmitter transporter) could be relevant here.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis and the interactions that the molecule might have with different biological targets, the related genes are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, KCNH2, and SLC6A4. 
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, KCNH2, SLC6A4.
