Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COCc1n[n-]c(=NC(=O)CSc2ccc(C)cc2)s1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a pyrrole ring, a benzene ring, and several substituents including a nitrile group (-CN), a cyano group (CN), and a carbamate moiety (-OC(=O)-N). This structure suggests that the molecule may interact with proteins involved in signaling pathways or enzyme activities.
Step 2: The presence of the carbamate group (-OC(=O)-N) indicates potential activity as an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes such as carboxylesterases or monoamine oxidases, which are often associated with drug metabolism and neurotransmission.
Step 3: The nitrile group (-CN) and cyano group (CN) can participate in hydrogen bonding and π-π stacking interactions, which are common in ligand-receptor binding events. These functional groups could interact with receptors or enzymes that have hydrophobic pockets or charged surfaces.
Step 4: Considering the potential for the molecule to interact with enzymes and receptors, it is likely to be related to genes encoding for proteins involved in neurotransmission, hormone regulation, and drug metabolism. Specific genes like CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which encode cytochrome P450 enzymes, are directly related due to their role in metabolizing drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule might influence G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels, suggesting a relationship with genes such as DRD2, HTR2A, HRH1, and KCNH2, which are involved in neurotransmitter signaling and ion channel function.
