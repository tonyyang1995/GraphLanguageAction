Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=S(=O)([O-])c1nc2ccccc2n1Cc1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule in question is a sulfate ester of a heterocyclic compound, which includes an oxygen atom double-bonded to sulfur (sulfate group) and a negatively charged oxygen atom. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP (Cytochrome P450) family genes.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring with multiple substituents, particularly the nitrogen-containing heterocycles, indicates the molecule may interact with receptors that have similar functional groups, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This could relate to genes encoding various GPCRs, including adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), and dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4).
Step 3: The presence of a pyridine ring in the molecule might suggest potential interaction with enzymes involved in DNA repair or transcriptional regulation, such as those encoded by PTGS1 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1), which is involved in prostaglandin synthesis, and SLC6A4 (solute carrier family 6 member 4), a sodium-dependent neurotransmitter transporter.
Step 4: The overall structure also hints at possible interactions with enzymes involved in signaling pathways, such as kinases (e.g., LCK, MCL1) and receptors like HRH1 (histamine H1 receptor). These interactions could be mediated through binding sites that share structural or functional similarities with the molecule.
Step 5: Given the diverse potential interactions, the most likely related genes are those involved in metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), neurotransmission (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), and signaling (LCK, MCL1, HRH1).
