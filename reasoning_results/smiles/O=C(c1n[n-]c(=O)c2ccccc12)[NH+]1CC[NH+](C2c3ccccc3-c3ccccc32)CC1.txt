Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(c1n[n-]c(=O)c2ccccc12)[NH+]1CC[NH+](C2c3ccccc3-c3ccccc32)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple functional groups such as an amide (C=O), imidazole (N-), and aromatic rings (c1n[n-]c). This structure suggests the molecule could be involved in interactions with proteins that have similar chemical functionalities.
Step 2: Looking at the gene names provided, several are associated with receptors and enzymes that might interact with molecules having these functional groups. For example, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 are all involved in metabolism or signaling pathways where the molecule’s structure could fit.
Step 3: The presence of an amide group in the molecule might particularly interest enzymes like CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize amides and other drugs. Similarly, the imidazole group could be relevant for interactions with receptors like DRD2 and HTR2A, which have imidazole-based ligands.
Step 4: The aromatic ring structure in the molecule could also be significant for its interaction with proteins such as PTGS1, which has a known affinity for aromatic compounds. Additionally, this feature might enable the molecule to bind to voltage-gated calcium channels like CACNA1H.
Step 5: Based on the chemical structure and the functional groups present, the molecule appears to be most closely related to the following genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, DRD2, HTR2A, PTGS1, and CACNA1H.
