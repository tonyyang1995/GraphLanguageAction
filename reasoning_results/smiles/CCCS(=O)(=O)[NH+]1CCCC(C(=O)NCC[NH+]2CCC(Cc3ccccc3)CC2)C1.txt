Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCS(=O)(=O)[NH+]1CCCC(C(=O)NCC[NH+]2CCC(Cc3ccccc3)CC2)C1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a core structure consisting of a benzene ring system, which is common in many drugs that interact with receptors and enzymes. This core structure suggests potential interactions with genes encoding for receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of multiple amide groups (-CO-NH-) indicates the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes such as those involved in drug metabolism. CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 are known to metabolize various compounds, including some drugs.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a pyridine ring, which is often found in compounds that act as agonists or antagonists for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This feature may relate to genes like HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode serotonin receptors.
Step 4: The presence of a quinoline ring in the molecule could indicate interaction with genes involved in neurotransmitter systems, such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which encode dopamine receptors.
Step 5: Given the structure's potential to interact with both metabolic enzymes and receptor proteins, the related genes include: CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4. Step 6: Summary of related genes: CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
