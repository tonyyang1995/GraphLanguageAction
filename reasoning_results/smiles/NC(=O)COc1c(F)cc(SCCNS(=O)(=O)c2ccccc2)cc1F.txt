Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NC(=O)COc1c(F)cc(SCCNS(=O)(=O)c2ccccc2)cc1F, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a core structure that includes an amide (NC(=O)) and a carboxylic acid (CO). This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, particularly those related to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of fluorine atoms (F) and a sulfonamide group (SCCNS(=O)(=O)) indicates the molecule may have pharmacological properties such as binding to or modulating GPCRs, which are often involved in neurotransmitter signaling and are associated with several genes listed.
Step 3: The aromatic ring system (c1c(F)cc(SCCNS(=O)(=O)c2ccccc2)) with attached substituents could interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP), suggesting potential metabolism-related effects through CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 4: The overall structure, including the amide and carboxylic acid functionalities, may influence the molecule’s ability to interact with receptors and enzymes, possibly affecting genes like DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode for serotonin receptors.
Step 5: Considering the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6. Step 6: Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
