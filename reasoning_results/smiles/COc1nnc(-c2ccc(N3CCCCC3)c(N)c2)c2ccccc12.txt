Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1nnc(-c2ccc(N3CCCCC3)c(N)c2)c2ccccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains multiple rings, including a pyrrole ring, which is part of the nitrogen-containing heterocycle system. This structure is common in many ligands that interact with receptors and transport proteins.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and a naphthalene-like structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP (Cytochrome P450) enzymes.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a quinoline-like structure, which is known to interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly those involved in neurotransmission.
Step 4: Given the presence of amines and nitrogen-containing groups, the molecule may have affinity for ion channels and receptors, such as those listed under genes like CHRM (Cholinergic Receptors) and HTR (Serotonin Receptors).
Step 5: Based on the structural features identified, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes, including CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C.
