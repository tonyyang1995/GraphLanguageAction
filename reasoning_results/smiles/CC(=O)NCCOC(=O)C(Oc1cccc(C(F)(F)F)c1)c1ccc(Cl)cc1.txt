Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(=O)NCCOC(=O)C(Oc1cccc(C(F)(F)F)c1)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple functional groups such as an amide (N-C=O), ester (O-C=O), and aromatic rings. These features suggest it could be involved in interactions with receptors or enzymes that have similar chemical functionalities.
Step 2: Notably, the molecule contains a benzene ring with fluorine substituents, which are common in drugs targeting G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This indicates potential interaction with genes encoding GPCRs, as they often have ligand-binding domains that recognize aromatic molecules.
Step 3: The presence of an amide group and ester functionality suggests the molecule might interact with enzymes like CYPs (Cytochrome P450) that metabolize such compounds. Specifically, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are known to metabolize drugs with similar functional groups.
Step 4: Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, the molecule could also potentially interact with other enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways, such as kinases. LCK (Lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase) is a key kinase involved in T-cell signaling, which might be relevant if the molecule exhibits kinase inhibitory activity.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes including but not limited to: ABL1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, EGFR, ESR1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KDR, LCK, OPRK1, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4. These genes encode proteins involved in receptor binding, metabolism, and signaling pathways that could be affected by the molecule’s chemical structure.
