Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)(C)Sc1c(CC(C)(C)C(=O)[O-])n(Cc2ccc(Cl)cc2)c2ccc(OCc3ccc4ccccc4n3)cc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings and functional groups such as ester (C(=O)[O-]), amide (CC(C)(C)C(=O)), and aromatic (c2ccc(Cl)cc2, c3ccc4ccccc4n3). It also contains a sulfonamide group (Sc1c) and a phenolic hydroxyl group (OCc3ccc4ccccc4n3).
Step 2: The presence of a sulfonamide group and a phenolic hydroxyl group in the molecule suggests that it could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes involved in drug metabolism. CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 are key enzymes in this regard.
Step 3: The molecule's structure also indicates potential interactions with receptors and ion channels. For instance, the presence of aromatic rings and amide groups might interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are involved in neurotransmission.
Step 4: The molecule's chemical structure might also influence its interaction with ion channels, particularly voltage-gated potassium channels like KCNH2, which is associated with cardiac function and arrhythmias.
Step 5: Given the molecule's potential to interact with enzymes and receptors, the related genes include CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, KCNH2, and possibly others involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmission.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2D6
- CYP2C19
- CYP3A4
- DRD2
- DRD3
- DRD4
- KCNH2 Step 5: The molecule likely interacts with several genes involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmission, and ion channel regulation. Therefore, the related genes are CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, and KCNH2. These genes play crucial roles in how the body processes and responds to the molecule.
