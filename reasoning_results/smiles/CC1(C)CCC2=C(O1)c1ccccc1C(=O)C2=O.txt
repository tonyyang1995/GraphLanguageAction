Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC1(C)CCC2=C(O1)c1ccccc1C(=O)C2=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with an amide group and an ester group. This structural pattern suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Step 2: The presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group and an amide group indicates possible interactions with receptors and ion channels, such as CHRM1 (cholinergic receptor), HTR2A (serotonin receptor), and KCNH2 (potassium channel).
Step 3: The molecule's aromatic nature and presence of a carbonyl group could indicate binding to proteins like PTGS1 (cyclooxygenase), which is involved in prostaglandin synthesis.
Step 4: The overall structure may also suggest interaction with genes encoding for G-protein coupled receptors, such as DRD2 (dopamine receptor), DRD3 (dopamine receptor), and DRD4 (dopamine receptor).
Step 5: Given the molecule's potential to interact with various enzymes and receptors, it is likely to be related to the following genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CHRM1, HTR2A, PTGS1, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
