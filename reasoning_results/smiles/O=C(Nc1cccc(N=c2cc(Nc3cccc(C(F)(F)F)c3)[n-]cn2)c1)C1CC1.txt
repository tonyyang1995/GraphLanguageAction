Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Nc1cccc(N=c2cc(Nc3cccc(C(F)(F)F)c3)[n-]cn2)c1)C1CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring system and a quinoline moiety, which are characteristic of many drugs that interact with receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways. This structural pattern suggests potential interaction with genes encoding receptors and enzymes related to these pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) and fluorine atoms (F) in the molecule indicates potential for modulating enzyme activity, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs), which are encoded by CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These enzymes play crucial roles in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The aromatic amine and amide functionalities in the molecule suggest possible interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly those encoded by DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are dopamine receptors, and HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are serotonin receptors.
Step 4: The presence of a benzene ring and a carbonyl group could indicate potential binding to ion channels or kinases. This might relate to KCNH2, which encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel, and LCK, which encodes a tyrosine kinase.
Step 5: The overall structure hints at possible modulation of multiple signaling pathways, which could involve genes like PTGS1, which encodes an enzyme involved in prostaglandin synthesis, and SLC6A2 and SLC6A4, which encode transporters involved in neurotransmitter reuptake.
Summary of related gene names: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, LCK, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
