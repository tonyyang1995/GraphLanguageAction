Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(C(=O)Nc2cccc(C(F)(F)F)c2)cc1-c1ccc2[n-]c(=NCC[NH+]3CCOCC3)ncc2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple functional groups such as a benzene ring, amide group (-CONH2), and amines (-NH2). The presence of these groups suggests potential interactions with proteins that have similar chemical functionalities.
Step 2: Notably, the molecule contains an amide group and an amine group, which are common in ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other receptor proteins. This indicates a possible interaction with receptors that recognize these functional groups.
Step 3: Among the provided genes, several are known to code for GPCRs, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These receptors typically bind to neurotransmitters and hormones and are involved in various physiological processes.
Step 4: The presence of a benzene ring in the molecule could also suggest potential interactions with transporters and enzymes, as these molecules often contain aromatic rings. Genes like ABCB1 (a drug efflux transporter) and CYP2D6 (an enzyme involved in drug metabolism) might be relevant due to their involvement in handling aromatic compounds.
Step 5: Based on the chemical structure and functional groups present in the molecule, it is likely to interact with the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, ABCB1, and CYP2D6.
