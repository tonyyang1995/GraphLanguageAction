Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCc1nc2c(C)cc(-c3nc4ccccc4n3C)cc2n1Cc1ccc(-c2ccccc2C(=O)[O-])cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound with multiple rings, including aromatic and heterocyclic rings, which suggests it has potential for interacting with various biological targets. The presence of nitrogen atoms in some rings indicates the possibility of forming hydrogen bonds or other interactions with proteins containing amino acid residues.
Step 2: Notably, the molecule contains a carboxylate group (-COO-) and an amide (-CONH-) functionality. These functional groups are often involved in binding to receptors that have ion channels or transporters as their targets, such as certain G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channel proteins. This structural feature could be relevant to several of the listed genes, particularly those encoding for receptors or ion channels.
Step 3: Given the presence of a benzene ring with substituents like methyl groups and an ester group, this molecule might have affinity for enzymes that metabolize drugs or xenobiotics, such as those encoded by CYP (cytochrome P450) genes. For instance, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are known to metabolize many drugs, and their involvement in drug metabolism could make them relevant to this molecule.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's overall structure, with its multiple functional groups and rings, could potentially interact with nuclear receptors, which are transcription factors that regulate gene expression in response to ligands. Genes like NR1H2 (LXRα), NR1H3 (LXRβ), and NR1H4 (FXR) encode nuclear receptors that could be influenced by this molecule through direct binding or allosteric modulation.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the related genes are likely to be those involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6), receptor signaling pathways (including GPCRs and ion channels), and nuclear receptor-mediated gene regulation (NR1H2, NR1H3, NR1H4).
