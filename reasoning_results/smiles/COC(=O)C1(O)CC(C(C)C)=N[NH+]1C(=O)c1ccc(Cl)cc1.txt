Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COC(=O)C1(O)CC(C(C)C)=N[NH+]1C(=O)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system and an amide group (-CONH-). This structure is common in ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are often involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a quaternary ammonium salt (N+), typically found in histamine H3 receptor antagonists, suggests potential interaction with histamine receptors.
Step 3: The molecule includes a substituted benzothiazole ring, which is known to interact with various receptors, including adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 4: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) and halogen atoms (Cl) indicates potential for interactions with enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 5: Given the structure and functional groups, the molecule may be related to genes encoding receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and HTR2A.
Related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, HTR2A.
