Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCC(=O)[NH+]1CC[NH+](C(=O)c2ccccc2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a derivative of the amino acid cysteine and contains a carboxamide group (-CONH2) attached to an aromatic ring, which is part of a larger heterocyclic structure. This pattern suggests that the molecule may interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways or transport mechanisms.
Step 2: The presence of a positively charged amine group (N+) indicates that the molecule could be an agonist or inhibitor of ion channels or receptors, particularly those that bind positively charged ligands. This feature is relevant to genes encoding ion channel subunits and receptors.
Step 3: The aromatic ring system, which includes benzene and pyrrole rings, is common in molecules that can modulate G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as adrenergic and muscarinic receptors. This structural element is likely to interact with genes involved in neurotransmission and hormone signaling.
Step 4: The presence of multiple substituents, including alkyl chains and a carboxylic acid group, suggests that the molecule could act as a ligand for nuclear receptors or enzymes involved in drug metabolism. This property is relevant to genes coding for cytochrome P450 enzymes and transcription factors.
Step 5: Considering the above structural features, the molecule is most likely related to genes involved in neurotransmission, hormone signaling, and drug metabolism. The related gene names are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, ESR1, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, and CYP3A4. Step 5: Summary of related gene names:
- ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, ESR1, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, CYP3A4.
