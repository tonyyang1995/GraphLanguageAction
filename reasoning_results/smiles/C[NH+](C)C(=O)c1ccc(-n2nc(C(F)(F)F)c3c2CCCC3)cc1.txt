Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+](C)C(=O)c1ccc(-n2nc(C(F)(F)F)c3c2CCCC3)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom that is part of an amide group (-CONH2), which suggests it may be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors that interact with such functional groups. This feature is relevant to several genes involved in enzymatic activities and neurotransmitter signaling.
Step 2: The presence of fluorine atoms (F) in the molecule, specifically in the form of trifluoromethyl (-CF3) groups, indicates that the molecule might have specific binding affinities for proteins that recognize or interact with these functional groups. Genes encoding proteins with known interactions involving halogenated compounds could be relevant.
Step 3: The overall structure includes a benzene ring and a heterocyclic ring (likely a pyrrole or furan ring given the nitrogen and oxygen atoms). Such structural motifs are often recognized by enzymes and receptors, particularly those involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmission. Genes associated with these processes are likely to be relevant.
Step 4: The molecule's structure does not directly correspond to any of the listed genes' primary protein functions but rather to their potential interaction sites. However, some of the genes listed encode proteins that are known to interact with small molecules through their binding sites, such as receptors and transporters.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the following genes could be considered related due to their involvement in similar biological processes or potential direct interactions:
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- DRD2
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
These genes are related to the molecule through their roles in drug metabolism and neurotransmitter signaling. The molecule's structure and functional groups suggest potential interactions with these genes' encoded proteins. Step 5: Summary of Related Genes: CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B. These genes are primarily involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmitter signaling, making them potentially relevant to the described molecule.
