Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N=c1nc(Oc2ccc3c(C(=O)Nc4cccc(C(F)(F)F)c4)cccc3c2)cc[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other type of explanation.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring system with a cyano group (-CN) attached to it, which is characteristic of many ligands that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring with a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a carboxamide group (-CONH2) suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism or signaling pathways.
Step 3: The molecule has a quinoline-like structure with fluorine substituents, indicating possible activity against certain drug targets such as ion channels or kinases.
Step 4: The overall structure and functional groups suggest potential interactions with multiple GPCRs and enzymes, including DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and OPNK1.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and functional groups, the related genes are DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and OPRK1. 
Related Genes: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, OPRK1.
