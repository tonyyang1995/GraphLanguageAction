Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC1(C)Oc2ccc(NC(=O)c3ccco3)cc2O1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule, represented by the SMILES string CC1(C)Oc2ccc(NC(=O)c3ccco3)cc2O1, has a benzene ring system with an amide group attached to it. This structural feature suggests potential interactions with enzymes that metabolize drugs or other small molecules.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (N-C=O) indicates that the molecule could be a substrate for enzymes involved in the metabolism of amides, such as CYP2D6, which is known to metabolize many amide-containing drugs.
Step 3: The benzene ring and the presence of an oxygen atom in the molecule might also suggest potential interactions with receptors or transporters that bind to aromatic compounds, such as DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2) and SLC6A4 (Serotonin transporter).
Step 4: Given the amide group and the overall structure, the molecule may also interact with enzymes involved in the metabolism of amides, such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19.
Step 5: Based on the structure and potential interactions, the related genes are CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, DRD2, and SLC6A4.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2D6
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- DRD2
- SLC6A4 Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with an amide group attached, indicating it could interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The amide group suggests potential interaction with CYP2D6, which metabolizes many amide-containing drugs.
Step 3: The benzene ring and oxygen atom may indicate binding to aromatic receptors or transporters like DRD2 and SLC6A4.
Step 4: The amide group also implies possible interaction with CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which metabolize various drugs including amides.
Step 5: Based on the structure, the related genes are CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, DRD2, and SLC6A4.
- SLC6A4
