Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(N=c1[n-]nc(SCc2ccc(F)cc2)s1)c1ccccn1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound with a central carbon atom double-bonded to a nitrogen atom, which itself is part of a heterocyclic ring system. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes or receptors that have similar functional groups or binding sites.
Step 2: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in the molecule could indicate a possible interaction with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP (Cytochrome P450) enzymes like CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These enzymes are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule contains a benzene ring, which may suggest potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2) and HTR2A (Serotonin receptor 2A). Both of these receptors are known to bind to ligands with aromatic structures.
Step 4: The molecule also has a pyridine ring and a thioether linkage, which might be relevant for interactions with ion channels and transporters. For example, CACNA1H (Calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha 1H) and SLC6A4 (Solute carrier family 6 member 4, which is a serotonin transporter) could be candidates for such interactions.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions with enzymes and receptors, the related genes are: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A, CACNA1H, and SLC6A4.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP1A2
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- DRD2
- HTR2A
- CACNA1H
- SLC6A4
These genes are associated with drug metabolism, neurotransmission, and ion channel function, which aligns with the structural features of the given molecule.
