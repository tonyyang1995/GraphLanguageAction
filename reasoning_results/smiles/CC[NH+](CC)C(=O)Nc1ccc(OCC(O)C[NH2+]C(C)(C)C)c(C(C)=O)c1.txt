Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC[NH+](CC)C(=O)Nc1ccc(OCC(O)C[NH2+]C(C)(C)C)c(C(C)=O)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound with multiple functional groups including an amine group (-NH+), a carboxyl group (-COOH), and aromatic rings. This structure suggests the molecule could be an agonist or inhibitor of receptors or enzymes that interact with these functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of the amine group (-NH+) indicates potential interactions with ion channels or receptors that have amine-binding sites, such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4). These receptors are involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways.
Step 3: The carboxyl group (-COOH) and aromatic rings suggest the molecule could interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) which are involved in drug metabolism. Additionally, the carboxyl group might allow for interactions with G protein-coupled receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) that are involved in regulating mood and behavior.
Step 4: The molecule's structure also implies possible interactions with kinases (LCK, PTGS1) and transporters (SLC6A2, SLC6A4) that play roles in cellular signaling and neurotransmitter uptake.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule may be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, LCK, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
