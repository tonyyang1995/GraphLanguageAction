Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)(O)C#Cc1ccc(C(=O)NCc2cccs2)s1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure containing aromatic rings (indicated by the double bonds), an amide group (-CONH-), and a ketone group (-CO-). The presence of these functional groups suggests potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for similar chemical moieties.
Step 2: Analyzing the gene names provided, we can see that several are involved in neurotransmitter systems (e.g., DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) which could potentially interact with molecules having amide and ketone groups, as these are common in many psychoactive substances.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a benzene ring with a substituted cyano group (-CN), which might indicate a potential interaction with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP genes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Step 4: Given the complexity of the molecule, it is plausible that it could interact with multiple receptors or enzymes, but based on the available information, the most likely interactions would be with neurotransmitter-related genes and metabolic pathway genes.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- HTR6
- CYP1A2
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
These genes are associated with neurotransmitter systems and metabolic pathways, which aligns with the functional groups present in the molecule. However, it's important to note that this is based on structural similarity and does not necessarily imply direct interaction without further experimental validation.
