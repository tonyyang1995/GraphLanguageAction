Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)c1ccccc1)c1ccco1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples or additional unnecessary text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrile group (-CN) and an amide group (-CONH-), which are functional groups often involved in drug metabolism and receptor binding. These functional groups suggest potential interactions with enzymes or receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a chlorinated benzene ring (-Cl-C6H4-) indicates possible interaction with enzymes involved in xenobiotic metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize chlorinated compounds.
Step 3: The molecule includes a quinoline-like structure, which could interact with ion channels or transporters. This suggests potential relevance to genes like KCNH2, which encodes a potassium channel protein.
Step 4: The overall structure and functional groups may also indicate potential interactions with neurotransmitter receptors, particularly those involved in serotonin (5-HT) signaling, such as HTR2A and HTR2B, given their role in binding to various ligands.
Step 5: Considering the above structural features, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, KCNH2, HTR2A, HTR2B. 
Summary of Related Genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, KCNH2, HTR2A, HTR2B.
