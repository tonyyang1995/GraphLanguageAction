Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(OCC(=O)[NH+]1CC[NH+](C(=O)c2ccco2)CC1)c1cc(-c2ccco2)nc2ccccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule has a complex structure that includes an aromatic ring system, amide groups, and a quaternary ammonium salt group. These features suggest potential interactions with receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a quaternary ammonium salt group indicates that this molecule could act as a ligand for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This is supported by the presence of several GPCR-related genes in the given list, such as DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are involved in regulating various neurotransmitter systems including dopamine, serotonin, and histamine.
Step 3: The aromatic ring system and amide groups suggest potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism. CYP enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, as well as CYP3A4, play significant roles in metabolizing drugs and xenobiotics, making them relevant to this molecule's potential pharmacological effects.
Step 4: Given the complexity of the molecule, it might also interact with ion channels and transporters. For instance, KCNH2 encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel, which could be affected by the molecule's structure. Additionally, SLC6A2 and SLC6A4, which encode neurotransmitter transporters, might also have interactions due to the molecule's ability to modulate receptor activity.
Step 5: Considering the comprehensive nature of the molecule's structure and its potential interactions with multiple biological targets, the related genes include: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, KCNH2, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4. These genes are involved in neurotransmission, drug metabolism, and ion channel function.
