Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc(OCC(=O)Nc2ccc(S(=O)(=O)[NH+]=C3CCCCCN3)cc2)c(C(C)C)cc1Cl, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound with a benzene ring, an amide group, a sulfonyl group, and several other functional groups. It also contains a chlorine atom. This structure suggests that it could be a drug-like molecule, possibly with multiple pharmacological activities.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (C(=O)N) and a sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)) indicates potential interactions with enzymes and receptors involved in signal transduction pathways. The amide group is common in ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), while the sulfonyl group might interact with cysteine residues or other polar groups.
Step 3: The molecule's structure includes a benzene ring with substituents such as a phenyl ring and a methyl group. Benzene rings are often found in ligands for various receptors and enzymes, including those involved in neurotransmission and inflammation.
Step 4: Given the complexity and specific functional groups present, this molecule could potentially interact with several genes involved in neurotransmission, signal transduction, and inflammation. Specifically, it may interact with genes encoding receptors and enzymes that are part of these pathways.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the following genes are likely to be related: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, and CYP2C9.
