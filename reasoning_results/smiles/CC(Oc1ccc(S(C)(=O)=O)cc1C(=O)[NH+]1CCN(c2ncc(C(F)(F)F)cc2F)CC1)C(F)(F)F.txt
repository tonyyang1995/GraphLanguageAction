Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(Oc1ccc(S(C)(=O)=O)cc1C(=O)[NH+]1CCN(c2ncc(C(F)(F)F)cc2F)CC1)C(F)(F)F, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this relationship might be clinically relevant.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with an oxygen atom attached, which is part of a larger structure that includes a pyridine ring and a substituted aromatic ring. This pattern is characteristic of several drugs that interact with receptors and transport proteins.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a quaternary ammonium salt (N+), along with fluorine substituents, suggests potential interactions with proton pumps, cholinergic receptors, and other ion channels. These functional groups are common in molecules that target neurotransmitter systems and ion channels.
Step 3: The molecule also has a cyclic amide structure, which is known to form hydrogen bonds and can interact with various enzymes and receptors. This feature is particularly relevant for drugs that modulate G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 4: Given the complex structure and the presence of multiple functional groups, the molecule could potentially interact with several genes involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmission, such as those encoding enzymes like CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4, as well as receptors like HTR2A, HTR2B, and CHRM1.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related genes include CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, and CHRM1. These genes are involved in the metabolism of the molecule and its interaction with neurotransmitter systems.
