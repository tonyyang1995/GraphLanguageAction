Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1cc(-c2ccccc2)oc2cc([O-])ccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional text.
Step 1: The molecule is an oxazoline derivative, featuring a benzene ring system with a cyano group (-CN) attached to it. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes that metabolize similar compounds, such as CYP (Cytochrome P450) enzymes.
Step 2: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 are known to metabolize various oxazoline derivatives and benzene-containing molecules. These enzymes could be involved in the biotransformation of the given molecule.
Step 3: The presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) in the molecule might also indicate interaction with estrogen receptors, particularly ESR1, as this receptor binds to estrogenic compounds.
Step 4: The overall structure does not suggest direct interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), but the molecule could potentially modulate their activity through indirect mechanisms, possibly affecting DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, or other receptors involved in neurotransmission.
Step 5: Given the above points, the related genes include: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, ESR1, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B. 
Summary of Related Genes: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, ESR1, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B.
