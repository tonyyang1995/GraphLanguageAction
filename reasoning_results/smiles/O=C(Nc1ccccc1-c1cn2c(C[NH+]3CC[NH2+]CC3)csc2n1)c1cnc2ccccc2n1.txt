Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Nc1ccccc1-c1cn2c(C[NH+]3CC[NH2+]CC3)csc2n1)c1cnc2ccccc2n1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound that includes a core structure with a central benzene ring system, which is connected to various functional groups such as amides, nitroso groups, and heterocycles. This structure suggests the molecule could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction, receptor binding, or enzymatic activity.
Step 2: The presence of a nitroso group (-N=O) and amide functionalities (-CONH-) indicates potential for interaction with proteins containing amino acid residues that can form hydrogen bonds or electrostatic interactions. Such interactions are common in ligand-receptor binding, which is relevant to many of the listed genes, especially those coding for receptors and enzymes.
Step 3: Several of the genes listed encode for receptors (e.g., ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HRH1). These receptors typically have hydrophobic and polar regions that can accommodate the hydrophobic and polar parts of the molecule, respectively. The complex structure of the molecule might enable it to bind to multiple sites on these receptors, potentially modulating their activity.
Step 4: Additionally, some genes code for enzymes (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) that are involved in drug metabolism. The presence of aromatic rings and heteroatoms in the molecule suggests it could be a substrate for these enzymes, leading to metabolic changes that might affect its pharmacological profile.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and the types of interactions it could have, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HRH1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. These genes are primarily involved in neurotransmitter signaling and drug metabolism. 
Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HRH1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
