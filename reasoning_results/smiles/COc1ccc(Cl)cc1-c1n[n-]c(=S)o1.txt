Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(Cl)cc1-c1n[n-]c(=S)o1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string (COc1ccc(Cl)cc1-c1n[n-]c(=S)o1) represents a chemical compound that contains several functional groups and structural features. Notably, it includes a benzene ring with a chloro substituent (-Cl), a nitrogen atom with a negative charge ([n-]), and a thiocyanate group (C=S). These features suggest the molecule might interact with proteins involved in neurotransmission, ion transport, or signaling pathways.
Step 2: Analyzing the gene list, we see that several genes are associated with neurotransmitter receptors, ion channels, and enzymes involved in drug metabolism. For instance, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 encode for various types of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release and signal transduction. Additionally, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 are enzymes involved in the metabolism of many drugs, including some that modulate neurotransmission.
Step 3: The thiocyanate group (-SCN) in the molecule could potentially interact with certain ion channels, such as those encoded by genes like KCNH2 (hERG potassium channel) or LCK (L-type calcium channel), which are involved in the regulation of neuronal excitability and neurotransmitter release.
Step 4: The presence of a nitrogen atom with a negative charge suggests the molecule may have properties similar to ligands that bind to GPCRs, such as those encoded by DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4 (dopamine receptors), which play crucial roles in reward, motivation, and motor control.
Step 5: Given the structural features of the molecule and its potential interactions with ion channels and GPCRs, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, LCK, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4. These genes are involved in neurotransmission, ion channel function, and receptor-mediated signaling pathways.
