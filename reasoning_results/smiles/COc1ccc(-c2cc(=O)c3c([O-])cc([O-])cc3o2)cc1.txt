Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(-c2cc(=O)c3c([O-])cc([O-])cc3o2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with an oxetane ring attached, which is characteristic of the CYP (Cytochrome P450) enzyme family substrates. This structural feature suggests that the molecule may interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These enzymes are known to metabolize various drugs and are important for pharmacokinetics.
Step 2: The presence of an ester group (-COO-) in the molecule indicates potential interactions with receptors that bind ligands with similar functional groups. Specifically, this feature might be relevant to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, including DRD2 (Dopamine Receptor D2), HTR2A (Serotonin Receptor 2A), and HTR2B (Serotonin Receptor 2B). These receptors are known to have ligands with ester functionalities.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a quinoline-like structure, which could indicate potential interactions with the ABL1 kinase, a target for certain cancer therapies. The quinoline structure is often found in inhibitors of ABL1 and other tyrosine kinases.
Step 4: The overall molecular structure, with its aromatic rings and polar functional groups, suggests that it may interact with ion channels, such as KCNH2 (Voltage-Gated Potassium Channel Subfamily H Member 2). Ion channels are often modulated by small molecules due to their permeability to charged ions.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule appears to be related to the following genes: CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, ABL1, and KCNH2. These genes encode proteins involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmitter signaling, and ion channel function, which are all relevant to the potential biological activities of the described molecule. 
Summary of Related Genes: CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, ABL1, KCNH2.
