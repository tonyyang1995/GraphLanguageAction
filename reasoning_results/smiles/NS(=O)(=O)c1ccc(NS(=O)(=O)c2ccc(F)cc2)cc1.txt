Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(NS(=O)(=O)c2ccc(F)cc2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure containing multiple nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), oxygen (O), and carbon (C) atoms, indicating it is likely a heterocyclic compound. Notably, the molecule contains sulfonamide groups (-SO2NH2) which are characteristic of certain drugs and biochemical compounds.
Step 2: The presence of multiple aromatic rings, particularly benzene rings, suggests that the molecule may interact with receptors or enzymes that have similar structural preferences, such as those involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways or metabolic pathways.
Step 3: Given the presence of multiple functional groups including sulfonyl groups and potentially reactive groups like amides, this molecule could interact with enzymes that metabolize drugs, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP). This includes CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize various pharmaceuticals.
Step 4: The molecule's overall structure also hints at potential interactions with GPCRs, given its complexity and the presence of functional groups that can bind to these receptors. GPCRs are involved in numerous physiological processes and are targets for many drugs. This includes genes such as DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode for various serotonin and dopamine receptors.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its likely interactions with metabolic and receptor pathways, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes are associated with drug metabolism and neurotransmitter signaling, respectively.
