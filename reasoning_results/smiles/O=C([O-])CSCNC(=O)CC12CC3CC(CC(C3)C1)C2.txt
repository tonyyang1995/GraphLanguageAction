Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])CSCNC(=O)CC12CC3CC(CC(C3)C1)C2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this information might be useful.
Step 1: The molecule has a structure that includes a benzene ring with an oxygen atom double-bonded to a carbon, which is further bonded to an oxygen atom (likely a hydroxyl group). This pattern is common in molecules that interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs.
Step 2: The molecule also contains a thiophene ring, which is often found in substrates for CYP3A4, another enzyme involved in drug metabolism. Additionally, the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) can influence binding to receptors such as HTR2A (serotonin receptor).
Step 3: The presence of a nitrogen atom double-bonded to a carbon (amino group) and a carboxamide group (-CONH2) suggests potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, and CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, which are known to bind to amino groups and carboxamides.
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule, including its aromatic rings and functional groups, could potentially interact with ion channels like KCNH2 and KDR, as well as receptors like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which have similar binding sites.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and functional groups present, the molecule may be related to the genes CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
