Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc2c(c1)N(CCC(=O)NCc1cccnc1)C(=O)CO2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other type of explanation.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a nitrogen atom attached, which is characteristic of amines. This structural feature is relevant to the neurotransmitter receptors, such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that interact with various neurotransmitters including dopamine.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a pyrrole ring fused to a benzene ring, which is a common feature in ligands for the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1), represented by CNR1. The presence of this structure suggests potential interaction with CB1 receptors.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule has a quinoline-like structure with a carboxylic acid group, which may indicate its potential as an inhibitor of enzymes like CYP2D6, known for metabolizing various drugs and endogenous compounds.
Step 4: The overall structure also includes multiple aromatic rings and functional groups, which could potentially bind to various targets, including kinases and ion channels. For instance, it might interact with LCK, a tyrosine kinase, and KCNH2, an ion channel protein.
Step 5: Given the diverse functional groups and structural motifs in the molecule, it is likely to have interactions with multiple genes involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmission, and signaling pathways. Therefore, the related genes include: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CNR1, CYP2D6, LCK, and KCNH2.
Summary of related genes: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CNR1, CYP2D6, LCK, KCNH2.
