Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [NH3+]CCNc1cccc2ccccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string [NH3+]CCNc1cccc2ccccc12 is an amine-containing compound with a benzene ring and a pyrrolidine ring. The presence of an amino group (-NH3+) suggests potential for interaction with proteins that have binding sites for basic residues.
Step 2: The benzene ring and pyrrolidine ring are common structural motifs in ligands that interact with receptors and transporters, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and transport proteins. This structural pattern could suggest interactions with genes encoding these types of proteins.
Step 3: Among the listed genes, several are known to encode GPCRs, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These receptors typically bind to small molecules and ions, which aligns with the structural characteristics of the molecule.
Step 4: Additionally, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 are enzymes involved in drug metabolism, which may interact with compounds like the given molecule through substrate binding. The presence of an amine group could be relevant to the binding mechanisms of these enzymes.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the molecule is potentially related to ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These genes encode proteins that could interact with the molecule based on its structural features. 
Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C19, CYP2D6.
