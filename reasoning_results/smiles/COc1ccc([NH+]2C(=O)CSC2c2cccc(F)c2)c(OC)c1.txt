Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc([NH+]2C(=O)CSC2c2cccc(F)c2)c(OC)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring system, which is characteristic of many ligands that interact with receptors such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This suggests potential interactions with genes encoding GPCRs.
Step 2: The molecule also has a phenolic group and a sulfonamide moiety, which are known to be involved in binding to enzymes and receptors. These functional groups may interact with genes encoding enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The presence of a quinolone-like structure in the molecule indicates possible interactions with genes involved in signaling pathways, such as CDK2, which is a cyclin-dependent kinase.
Step 4: The molecule's overall structure, including its size and shape, could potentially fit into binding sites of multiple receptors and enzymes, suggesting broad potential interactions with several genes.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to interact with a variety of genes, but the most probable ones include CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CDK2, and possibly GPCR-related genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, and DRD2.
