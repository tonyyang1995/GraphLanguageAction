Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cccc(CC(=O)N2CCc3c2ccc(-c2cn(C)c4[n-]cnc(=N)c24)c3F)n1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples or additional unnecessary text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a carboxamide group attached, which suggests it may interact with enzymes or receptors that have a preference for such functional groups. This structural feature could potentially relate to genes involved in drug metabolism and receptor signaling.
Step 2: The presence of a quinoline-like structure (quinoline core with an amide group) indicates possible interactions with receptors that have similar binding sites, particularly those involved in neurotransmission and G-protein coupled receptor pathways.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a pyrrole ring system, which might interact with enzymes or receptors that recognize or utilize this structural motif. This could be relevant to genes involved in metabolic pathways and receptor functions.
Step 4: Given the diverse structural elements, the molecule may interact with multiple genes, including those involved in neurotransmitter systems, such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which encode serotonin receptors; and DRD2, which encodes a dopamine receptor.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule might influence genes related to drug metabolism, such as CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4, due to its complex functional groups.
Summary of related gene names: HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4.
