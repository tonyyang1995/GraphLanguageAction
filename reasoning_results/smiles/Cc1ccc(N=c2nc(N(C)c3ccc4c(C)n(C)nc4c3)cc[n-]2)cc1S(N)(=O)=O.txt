Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(N=c2nc(N(C)c3ccc4c(C)n(C)nc4c3)cc[n-]2)cc1S(N)(=O)=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups including an aromatic ring, a nitrogen-containing heterocycle, and a sulfoxide group. The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) and a cyano group (-CN) suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The molecule contains a tricyclic core which is characteristic of many ligands for receptors and transporters involved in neurotransmission and hormone signaling pathways. This structure may interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as adrenergic and muscarinic receptors, which are encoded by genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 3: The presence of a sulfonylurea-like moiety could indicate a potential interaction with enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP3A4, which are involved in the metabolism of various drugs, including those that might target these genes' products.
Step 4: Given the presence of a pyrrolidine ring and a sulfur atom, this molecule could potentially interact with ion channels, particularly voltage-gated sodium channels, which might be relevant to the gene CACNA1H.
Step 5: The overall structure of the molecule suggests it could have interactions with multiple receptor and transporter proteins, but the most likely candidates based on its chemical features are ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and CACNA1H.
