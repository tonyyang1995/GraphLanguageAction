Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The SMILES string [NH3+]CCc1cc[n-]n1 represents a molecule with a positively charged amine group (-NH3+) attached to a benzene ring (CC) through an ethyl chain (C). This molecule contains a nitrogen atom that forms part of the amine group and a negatively charged nitrogen atom within a heterocyclic ring. The presence of a positively charged amine and a negatively charged nitrogen suggests that this molecule could interact with ion channels or receptors that have similar functional groups.
Step 2: Considering the molecular structure, the positively charged amine could potentially bind to negatively charged sites on receptors such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are known to be involved in signal transduction pathways. Additionally, the nitrogen-containing heterocycle could interact with ion channels or other proteins that contain amino acid residues with complementary charge or shape.
Step 3: Among the provided genes, those encoding for GPCRs (e.g., CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) and ion channels (e.g., KCNH2) might be particularly relevant due to their involvement in neurotransmission and ion transport processes. The positively charged amine and the nitrogen-containing heterocycle in the molecule suggest potential interactions with these types of proteins.
Step 4: The negatively charged nitrogen in the heterocyclic ring could also interact with positively charged residues in the binding pockets of certain enzymes or receptors, such as those encoded by CYP enzymes (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule may have interactions with the following genes: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, KCNH2, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. These genes encode proteins that are involved in neurotransmission, ion channel function, and drug metabolism, making them relevant to the molecule's potential biological activities.
