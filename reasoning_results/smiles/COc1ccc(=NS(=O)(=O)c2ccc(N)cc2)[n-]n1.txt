Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(=NS(=O)(=O)c2ccc(N)cc2)[n-]n1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure including a pyrrole ring, a thiazole ring, and a sulfur atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom (sulfonamide group). This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins that have similar chemical functionalities or binding sites.
Step 2: Analyzing the structure further, the presence of a nitrogen atom with a negative charge (-) and a carboxamide group could indicate the molecule may interact with receptors or enzymes that have positively charged binding pockets or catalytic sites, such as ion channels or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: Considering the molecular structure and its potential interactions, it's likely that this molecule could affect neurotransmitter systems, given the presence of functional groups that are characteristic of molecules interacting with receptors involved in neurotransmission. This is particularly relevant for genes encoding GPCRs and enzymes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism.
Step 4: Among the provided genes, several are known to encode receptors or enzymes that might interact with a molecule having a similar structure, including: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, and SIGMAR1. These genes are associated with various neurotransmitter systems and signal transduction pathways.
Step 5: Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, SIGMAR1.
The related gene names are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, SIGMAR1.
