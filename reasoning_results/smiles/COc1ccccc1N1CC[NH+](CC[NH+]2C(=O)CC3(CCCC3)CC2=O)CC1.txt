Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccccc1N1CC[NH+](CC[NH+]2C(=O)CC3(CCCC3)CC2=O)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with a nitrogen atom (N) attached to it, forming an amine group (-NH2). This structure is common in molecules that can interact with receptors or enzymes, particularly those involved in neurotransmission or metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a quinoline ring system (N1CC[NH+](CC[NH+]2C(=O)CC3(CCCC3)CC2=O)) suggests the molecule may have a similar pharmacophore to quinolines, which are known to interact with various receptors and enzymes. This pattern is indicative of potential interactions with genes encoding for receptors or enzymes that bind small molecules with similar structural motifs.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a piperidine ring system (COc1ccccc1), which is known to be involved in binding to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature is associated with the interaction of the molecule with genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, all of which encode for different subtypes of GPCRs.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule contains a pyrrole ring system (N1CC[NH+]), which could potentially interact with enzymes or receptors involved in metabolic pathways. This structure is relevant to genes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics and endogenous compounds.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and the presence of functional groups such as amine and carboxylate, the molecule may have interactions with multiple genes involved in neurotransmission, receptor binding, and metabolic processes. Therefore, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.
