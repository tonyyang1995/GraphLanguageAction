Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(NC(=O)NC2CC[NH+](Cc3ccccc3)CC2)c(OC)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure including a benzene ring system, a pyrrolidine ring, and a heterocyclic amide group. This structure suggests the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a heterocyclic amide group (N-C(=O)-N) and the presence of nitrogen atoms in the molecule indicate potential interactions with proteins that have similar functional groups or that are involved in binding to such groups. 
Step 3: The nitrogen atom in the heterocyclic amide and the amine group (-NH-) suggest that this molecule could potentially interact with receptors or enzymes that contain amino acid residues, particularly those with histidine or lysine which can form hydrogen bonds or ionic interactions.
Step 4: Given the above structural features, this molecule might interact with enzymes or receptors involved in neurotransmission or signal transduction pathways, as these often involve amino acid residues and can bind small molecules.
Step 5: Considering the potential for interaction with amino acid residues and the presence of specific functional groups, the molecule could be related to genes encoding for receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmission, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and CYP2D6.
Summary of related gene names: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2D6. These genes encode for various receptors and enzymes that could potentially interact with the described molecule.
