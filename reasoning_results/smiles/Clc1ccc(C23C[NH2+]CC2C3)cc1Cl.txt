Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Clc1ccc(C23C[NH2+]CC2C3)cc1Cl, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with multiple chlorine atoms (Cl) and a cyclic structure containing nitrogen (N) and carbon (C). This structure suggests it could interact with proteins that have binding sites for aromatic or polar groups.
Step 2: The presence of an amine group (-NH2) attached to a benzene ring indicates potential interaction with proteins that have amine-binding sites, such as receptors or enzymes. This feature is particularly relevant to genes encoding receptors or enzymes that bind to or metabolize molecules containing amine groups.
Step 3: The cyclic structure also includes a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (+), which could indicate the molecule is capable of forming hydrogen bonds or other types of interactions with negatively charged sites in proteins. This property is significant for genes involved in ion channels or transporters.
Step 4: Given the complexity and specific functional groups present in the molecule, it is likely to interact with proteins involved in neurotransmission or signal transduction pathways. Genes like HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 encode serotonin receptors, which are known to interact with various ligands including molecules with aromatic and amine functionalities.
Step 5: The molecule’s structure also hints at potential interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs and xenobiotics. Genes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 encode these enzymes, making them relevant candidates for interaction with the described molecule.
