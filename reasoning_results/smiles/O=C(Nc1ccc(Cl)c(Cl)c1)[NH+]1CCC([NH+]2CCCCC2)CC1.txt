Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1)[NH+]1CCC([NH+]2CCCCC2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring system, which is characteristic of several drugs that interact with neurotransmitter receptors. This structural feature suggests potential interaction with genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are involved in signal transduction pathways and neurotransmission.
Step 2: The presence of multiple aromatic rings, particularly the benzene rings, indicates that this molecule may have affinity for enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes. This aligns with the presence of CYP genes in the provided list, which encode these enzymes.
Step 3: The molecule also includes amide and ester functionalities, which are common in molecules that act as ligands for various receptor types, including those encoded by genes such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which encode dopamine receptors.
Step 4: Given the complex structure with multiple functional groups and the presence of both hydrophobic and polar regions, it is likely that this molecule could interact with membrane proteins like ion channels, which might be encoded by genes such as KCNH2.
Step 5: Considering the interactions with neurotransmitter receptors and metabolic enzymes, the following genes are likely to be related to the molecule: ABL1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, LCK, OPNK1, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
