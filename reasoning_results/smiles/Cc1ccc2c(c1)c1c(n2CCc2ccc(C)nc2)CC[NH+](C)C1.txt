Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc2c(c1)c1c(n2CCc2ccc(C)nc2)CC[NH+](C)C1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule, which appears to be a benzodiazepine derivative. This class of molecules often interacts with GABA-A receptors, which are involved in various neurological processes. The presence of a nitrogen atom in the structure, along with the cyclic and aromatic components, suggests that this molecule could potentially bind to or modulate GABAergic signaling.
Step 2: The GABA-A receptor subunits are encoded by several genes including GABRA1, GABRA2, GABRB1, GABRB2, GABRG1, GABRG2, and GABRD. While the given list does not include all GABA receptor genes, it does contain some relevant ones such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, and ADRB2, which encode for adrenergic receptors. These adrenergic receptors can interact with benzodiazepines and may influence their pharmacological effects through heterologous desensitization or allosteric modulation.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a pyrrolidine ring, which is known to interact with certain neurotransmitter receptors, particularly those involved in dopaminergic signaling. This structure is reminiscent of compounds that interact with dopamine receptors. The list includes DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which encode for dopamine D2, D3, and D4 receptors, respectively. Dopamine receptors play crucial roles in reward pathways, motor control, and cognitive functions, and they are often targeted by psychotropic drugs.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP). The list includes several CYP genes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, indicating that the molecule might be metabolized by these enzymes, affecting its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.
Step 5: Given the structure and potential interactions of the molecule, the related genes can be summarized as follows:
- ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2 (adrenergic receptors)
- DRD2, DRD3, DRD4 (dopamine receptors)
- CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 (cytochrome P450 enzymes) Step 5: Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6.
