Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCCCNC(=O)n1cc(F)c(=O)[n-]c1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that contains a benzene ring with various substituents such as alkyl chains, a nitrile group (-CN), an amide group (-CONH2), and fluorine atoms. This structure suggests the molecule could have pharmacological activity, potentially interacting with proteins involved in cellular signaling or transport processes.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-CONH2) indicates the molecule could be a potential ligand for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or enzymes that interact with amides. GPCRs are often targets for drugs due to their role in signal transduction pathways. This structural feature aligns with several genes listed, including DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), HTR1A (serotonin receptor 1A), HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A), HTR2B (serotonin receptor 2B), and HTR2C (serotonin receptor 2C).
Step 3: The benzene ring with substituents also suggests the molecule could act as a substrate for drug-metabolizing enzymes, particularly those involved in Phase I reactions such as cytochrome P450 enzymes. This is relevant to genes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which encode these enzymes.
Step 4: The presence of a nitrile group (-CN) and fluorine atoms may indicate the molecule has lipophilic properties, which can influence its ability to cross cell membranes and interact with intracellular targets. This property is relevant to genes encoding transporters, such as ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein), which is a well-known efflux transporter.
Step 5: The overall structure does not directly suggest strong interactions with other genes listed, such as those related to tyrosine kinase receptors (e.g., ABL1, FLT1, KDR), ion channels (e.g., KCNH2, CACNA1H), or nuclear receptors (e.g., PPARG, SIGMAR1). However, the potential for interaction with GPCRs and drug-metabolizing enzymes makes the above genes more likely candidates for this molecule.
