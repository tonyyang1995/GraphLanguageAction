Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCS(=O)(=O)NCC(c1cccnc1)[NH+]1CCN(c2ccccc2F)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a chemical compound with a structure that includes a benzene ring, an amide group (-CO-NH-), and a quinoline-like heterocyclic ring. The presence of a benzene ring suggests potential interactions with aromatic amino acids or proteins containing such residues. The amide group could indicate the molecule has pharmacological activity through interactions with enzymes or receptors that have amine or carboxyl functionalities.
Step 2: The quinoline-like heterocyclic ring may be involved in hydrogen bonding or π-π stacking interactions, which are common in drug-receptor binding. This ring also indicates the molecule might interact with proteins containing similar structural motifs, such as those found in G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or other membrane-bound receptors.
Step 3: Considering the functional groups present in the molecule, it is likely to interact with enzymes involved in metabolic pathways, such as CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). These enzymes play a crucial role in the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics, suggesting that the molecule could be metabolized by these enzymes.
Step 4: Given the presence of a positively charged nitrogen atom ([NH+]), the molecule may interact with negatively charged sites on proteins, such as acidic amino acids like glutamate or aspartate. This interaction could be relevant for the binding to ion channels (e.g., KCNH2, HTR1A) or other ion transporters that have negatively charged regions.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule appears to be related to several genes involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), neurotransmitter signaling (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), and ion channel function (KCNH2, HRH1).
