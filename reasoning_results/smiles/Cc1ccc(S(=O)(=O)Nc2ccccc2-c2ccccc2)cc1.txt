Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)Nc2ccccc2-c2ccccc2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring system with a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) attached to it, indicating it has potential for binding to receptors or enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) is characteristic of molecules that may interact with enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are involved in drug metabolism. These enzymes are known to oxidize drugs and xenobiotics, including those with sulfonyl groups.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a nitroimidazole ring (N-cyclohexyl), which could potentially interact with proteins such as HTR2A (serotonin receptor) and HTR2B (serotonin receptor). These receptors are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that play a role in neurotransmission and are often targets for drugs affecting mood and behavior.
Step 4: Given the complexity of the molecule, it may also have interactions with other GPCRs, such as DRD2 (dopamine receptor), which is involved in reward and motivation pathways.
Step 5: The molecule's structure does not directly suggest interactions with kinases like LCK or HRH1, or with genes involved in cell adhesion or growth such as PTGS1.
Related gene names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP3A4
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- DRD2 Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), suggesting potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The sulfonyl group (-SO2-) is commonly found in substrates for cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4.
Step 3: The presence of a nitroimidazole ring suggests possible interaction with serotonin receptors, specifically HTR2A and HTR2B.
Step 4: The molecule's structure may also engage with dopamine receptors, such as DRD2.
Step 5: There is no clear indication of direct interaction with kinases or cell adhesion/growth genes based on the given structure.
- DRD2
