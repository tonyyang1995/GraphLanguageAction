Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Nc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)N=c2nccc[n-]2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples or additional text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), which is a common pharmacophore in many drugs. This feature suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) indicates the molecule could be an inhibitor or substrate for enzymes that metabolize such compounds, like CYP2E1, though this enzyme is not listed.
Step 3: The aromatic ring system with a pyrrole ring (Nc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)N)cc1) suggests possible interactions with receptors that bind to aromatic amines or similar structures, such as adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors.
Step 4: The nitrogen-containing heterocycles and amine groups may interact with ion channels or G-protein coupled receptors, particularly those involved in neurotransmission.
Step 5: Given the structural features, the molecule might interact with genes encoding adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), and possibly cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
