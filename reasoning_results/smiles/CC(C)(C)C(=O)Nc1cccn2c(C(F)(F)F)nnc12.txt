Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)(C)C(=O)Nc1cccn2c(C(F)(F)F)nnc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring with substituents, a carbonyl group, and a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in signaling pathways and receptor binding.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring (likely an imidazole or similar group) indicates possible interaction with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are often targeted by drugs affecting neurotransmitter systems. This points to genes encoding GPCRs such as DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 3: The presence of a benzene ring with substituents and a carbonyl group could indicate a potential ligand for enzymes involved in metabolism or drug transport, such as CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). These enzymes play crucial roles in drug metabolism and may interact with the molecule.
Step 4: The overall structure does not suggest direct interactions with ion channels or transporters listed among the genes, but it might influence their activity indirectly through metabolic processes or by binding to GPCRs that regulate these functions.
Step 5: Based on the molecule’s structure and potential interactions, the related genes include: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.
