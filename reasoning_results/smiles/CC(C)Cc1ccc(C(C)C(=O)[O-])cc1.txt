Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)Cc1ccc(C(C)C(=O)[O-])cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound with a benzene ring, a pyrrole ring, and multiple substituents including methyl groups, an ester group, and a negatively charged oxygen atom. This structure suggests it could be a drug-like molecule with potential interactions with various biological targets.
Step 2: Analyzing the substituents and functional groups, the molecule contains an ester group (C(=O)[O-]), which is commonly found in drugs that act as ligands for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The presence of this functional group indicates a possible interaction with receptors involved in neurotransmission or hormone signaling pathways.
Step 3: Considering the pattern of substituents and the overall molecular structure, the molecule might interact with GPCRs, such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), and dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4). These receptors are known to modulate various physiological processes and are often targeted by pharmaceutical compounds.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a benzene ring and other substituents suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These cytochrome P450 enzymes play a crucial role in metabolizing many drugs, and their activity can affect the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of the molecule.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related genes are primarily those encoding GPCRs and enzymes involved in drug metabolism. The list of related genes includes:
- GPCRs: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4
- Drug Metabolism Enzymes: CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6
These genes are directly or indirectly involved in the potential pharmacological activities of the molecule described by the SMILES string. Step 5: Related Genes List:
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- ADRB2
- CHRM1
- CHRM3
- CHRM4
- DRD2
- DRD3
- DRD4
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
These genes are relevant due to the molecule's potential to interact with GPCRs and enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
