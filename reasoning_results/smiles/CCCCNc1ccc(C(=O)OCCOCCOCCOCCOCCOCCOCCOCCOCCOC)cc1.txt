Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCNc1ccc(C(=O)OCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOCCOC)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure containing a benzene ring, an amide group (-CONH2), and multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH). This structure suggests that it could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors involved in signaling pathways.
Step 2: The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) and an amide group (-CONH2) indicates potential interactions with enzymes such as CYP (Cytochrome P450) family members, which are known to metabolize drugs and other xenobiotics. Specifically, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are involved in the metabolism of various drugs and could potentially interact with this molecule.
Step 3: The benzene ring and amide group also suggest possible interactions with receptors that have similar functional groups, such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), like dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4).
Step 4: Given the complexity of the molecule and its potential to interact with multiple targets, it is likely that it could influence signaling pathways associated with these receptors and enzymes. For example, it might affect neurotransmission through GPCRs or drug metabolism through CYP enzymes.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is most likely to be related to the following genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
