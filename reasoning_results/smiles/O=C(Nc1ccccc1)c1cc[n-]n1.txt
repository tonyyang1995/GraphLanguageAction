Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Nc1ccccc1)c1cc[n-]n1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a structure that includes a benzene ring system, a nitrogen atom with a negative charge, and a cyano group (-CN). This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring system and a cyano group are characteristic of molecules that can act as substrates for CYP (cytochrome P450) enzymes, particularly CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. These enzymes are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: The negative charge on the nitrogen atom could also suggest interaction with ion channels or receptors, potentially affecting G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are associated with dopamine signaling.
Step 4: Given the overall structure, the molecule might interact with multiple genes, but the primary focus would be on those involved in drug metabolism (CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and neurotransmission (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4).
Step 5: The related gene names are: CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
Summary of related genes: CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4. Step 1: The molecule has a structure that includes a benzene ring system, a nitrogen atom with a negative charge, and a cyano group (-CN). This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The benzene ring system and cyano group indicate the molecule could be a substrate for CYP enzymes, particularly CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are key in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The negative charge on the nitrogen atom might interact with ion channels or receptors, potentially affecting G-protein coupled receptors like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are involved in dopamine signaling.
Step 4: Considering the molecular features, the main interactions are likely with genes involved in drug metabolism (CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and neurotransmission (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4).
Summary of related genes: CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring and a cyano group (-CN), indicating it may interact with CYP enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom with a negative charge suggests potential interactions with ion channels or receptors, possibly affecting G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: Key GPCRs involved in neurotransmission include DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are dopamine receptors.
Step 4: The overall structure points towards interactions with CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are important in drug metabolism.
