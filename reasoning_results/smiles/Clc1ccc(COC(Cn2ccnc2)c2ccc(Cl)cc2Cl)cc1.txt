Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Clc1ccc(COC(Cn2ccnc2)c2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains multiple rings, specifically a benzene ring (represented by C), a furan ring (O), and a pyrrole ring (N). These aromatic rings are often involved in drug binding due to their ability to form hydrogen bonds and π-π stacking interactions.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a chloride ion (Cl) and several hydroxyl groups (-OH). Chloride ions can be involved in various cellular processes, including signaling pathways. Hydroxyl groups can participate in hydrogen bonding, which is crucial for molecular recognition and binding.
Step 3: The presence of a benzene ring, particularly when substituted with other functional groups like hydroxyls or chlorides, suggests potential interaction with enzymes or receptors that have similar structural motifs. For instance, benzene rings are common in drugs targeting G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels.
Step 4: Given the structural features of the molecule, it could potentially interact with genes encoding proteins involved in neurotransmitter systems, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode serotonin receptors. Additionally, the molecule might interact with genes encoding enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 5: The molecule's potential interactions with these genes are based on its aromatic rings and functional groups, which can engage in specific binding interactions with the corresponding proteins.
