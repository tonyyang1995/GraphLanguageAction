Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+](Cc1ccc(C(C)(C)C)cc1)Cc1cccc2ccccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with a central nitrogen atom that is positively charged (NH+). This molecule also contains multiple aromatic rings, particularly benzene rings, which are common in many drugs and their active metabolites.
Step 2: The presence of multiple benzene rings suggests that this molecule could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which often bind to small molecules with aromatic groups. The molecule’s structure also indicates potential binding sites for enzymes, given its complexity and functional groups like amine and possibly hydroxyl or carbonyl groups.
Step 3: Considering the potential interactions with GPCRs, several of the listed genes are associated with GPCRs: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes encode receptors for adrenergic and cholinergic neurotransmitters and serotonin, which are known to interact with various ligands, including small molecules with aromatic structures similar to our molecule.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule’s structure might be relevant to enzymes encoded by genes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are part of the cytochrome P450 family. These enzymes are responsible for the metabolism of many drugs, and their substrates often include aromatic compounds, making them potential targets for drug interactions.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6.
