Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCN(C(=O)Cn1c(=O)oc2ccccc21)c1cccc(C(F)(F)F)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings and functional groups, including an amide (C(=O)N), a benzene ring (Cn1c(=O)oc2ccccc21), and fluorine substituents (C(F)(F)F). This structure suggests it could interact with proteins involved in various biological processes.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (C(=O)N) indicates the molecule could potentially act as an agonist or antagonist for receptors that have amide binding sites, such as some G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The benzene ring system in the molecule could be involved in interactions with proteins that have aromatic residues, which are common in many receptor and enzyme structures.
Step 4: Given the presence of fluorine atoms (C(F)(F)F), this molecule might have specific interactions with proteins containing fluorine-binding pockets, which are less common but exist in some enzymes and receptors.
Step 5: Considering the structure and potential binding sites, the molecule is likely to interact with several GPCRs and enzymes, specifically those involved in neurotransmitter signaling, hormone response, and metabolism. Genes related to these functions include DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.
