Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CN=c1[n-]n2c(C)cc(C)nc2c1S(=O)(=O)c1cccc(Cl)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), a benzene ring, and multiple nitrogen atoms, including a nitrogen that forms part of a nitro group (NO2). These structural features suggest that the molecule could interact with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP (cytochrome P450) genes, which are known to metabolize various xenobiotics.
Step 2: The presence of a nitro group and the overall aromatic nature of the molecule might also indicate potential interactions with receptors that bind to ligands containing similar functional groups. This suggests possible interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like HTR (serotonin receptor) family members, which include HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These receptors are known to be activated by various neurotransmitters and ligands.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a benzene ring and the overall structure of the molecule could indicate potential interactions with ion channels, particularly those encoded by genes like KCNH2, which encodes the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2 (hERG), an important target for drug-drug interactions due to its role in cardiac repolarization.
Step 4: The molecule's structure also suggests potential interactions with kinases, such as CDK2 (cyclin-dependent kinase 2) and LCK (lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase), both of which are involved in cell cycle regulation and signal transduction pathways.
Step 5: Based on the above structural analysis, the molecule may be related to several genes, including CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, CDK2, and LCK.
