Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)c1c(OCC)[nH]c2c1cc([O-])c1ccccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains an aromatic ring system with a benzene ring attached to an oxygen atom (phenolic group) and a carboxylic acid group. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism and signaling pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a phenolic group and a carboxylic acid group indicates possible binding to enzymes such as CYP2D6, which metabolizes many drugs containing these functional groups, and CYP3A4, another important drug-metabolizing enzyme.
Step 3: The molecule also has a cyclic amine structure, which could interact with receptors like HTR2A, a serotonin receptor, and DRD2, a dopamine receptor, both of which are involved in neurotransmission.
Step 4: The presence of a choline moiety (N-methylated amine) suggests potential interaction with cholinergic systems, possibly involving genes like CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4, which encode muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.
Step 5: Given the molecule’s structure and potential for metabolic interactions and receptor binding, the related genes include: CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, DRD2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4. Step 1: The molecule contains an aromatic ring system with a benzene ring attached to an oxygen atom (phenolic group) and a carboxylic acid group.
