Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(Cl)c(Nc2ccccc2C(=O)[O-])c1Cl, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound with a benzene ring structure, a chlorine atom, and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle. The presence of a nitrogen atom in the heterocycle indicates it might be an amine or a similar functional group, which can interact with proteins that have binding sites for such groups.
Step 2: The molecule also contains a carboxylate group (-COO-) attached to a carbon atom, which could potentially interact with enzymes or receptors that have acidic binding sites.
Step 3: The presence of a chlorine atom (-Cl) and a negatively charged oxygen (-O-) group suggests the molecule may have lipophilic and hydrophilic regions, which can influence its interaction with membrane-bound proteins or transporters.
Step 4: Given the molecular structure, it is plausible that this molecule could interact with proteins involved in neurotransmitter signaling pathways, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), as well as enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYP enzymes) due to its potential to be metabolized or to inhibit these enzymes.
Step 5: Based on the interactions described, the molecule may be related to several genes encoding for receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism. These include CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and SLC6A4.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, SLC6A4. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound with a benzene ring structure, a chlorine atom, and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle. This structure can suggest potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for aromatic rings and heterocycles.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylate group (-COO-) indicates the molecule may interact with enzymes or receptors that have acidic binding sites.
Step 3: The chlorine atom (-Cl) and the negatively charged oxygen (-O-) group suggest the molecule has both lipophilic and hydrophilic regions, which can influence its interaction with membrane-bound proteins or transporters.
Step 4: Considering the molecular structure, the molecule may interact with proteins involved in neurotransmitter signaling pathways, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), as well as enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYP enzymes) due to its potential to be metabolized or to inhibit these enzymes.
Step 5: Based on the interactions described, the molecule may be related to several genes encoding for receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism. These include CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3
