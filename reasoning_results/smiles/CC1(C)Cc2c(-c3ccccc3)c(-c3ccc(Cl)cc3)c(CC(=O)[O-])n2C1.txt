Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC1(C)Cc2c(-c3ccccc3)c(-c3ccc(Cl)cc3)c(CC(=O)[O-])n2C1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule provided has a complex structure that includes multiple functional groups such as a benzene ring, amide group, and a negatively charged oxygen atom. These structural features suggest potential interactions with various biological targets.
Step 2: Considering the presence of an amide group (-CO-NH-) and a benzene ring, this molecule could potentially interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP (Cytochrome P450) genes. Specifically, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are known to metabolize drugs containing similar functional groups.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a quinoline ring system, which is characteristic of some ligands for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This could imply a possible interaction with genes encoding GPCRs like DRD2, HTR2A, and HRH1, as these receptors often bind to molecules with aromatic rings.
Step 4: Given the presence of a carboxylate group (-COO-) and a benzene ring, the molecule might have affinity for ion channels. For instance, KCNH2 encodes a cardiac potassium channel, and such molecules can influence its activity.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule may be related to the following genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A, HRH1, and KCNH2.
