Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC[NH+](CC)CCCC(C)N=c1c2ccc(Cl)cc2[n-]c2ccc(OC)cc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge, indicated by [NH+], which suggests it could interact with negatively charged sites on proteins, potentially affecting ion channels or receptors.
Step 2: The presence of multiple aromatic rings and hydrophobic substituents (e.g., Cl, OC) indicates the molecule may have affinity for membrane-bound proteins such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The molecule's structure includes a benzene ring with a nitro group (-NO2), which could interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2D6 and CYP3A4.
Step 4: The presence of a benzene ring with an amide group (CONH2) might suggest interactions with cholinergic receptors, such as CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 5: Given the potential for interaction with GPCRs and enzymes involved in drug metabolism, the related genes include CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Summary of related genes: CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4. Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge, indicating it could interact with negatively charged sites on proteins, potentially affecting ion channels or receptors.
