Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups including amides, esters, and aromatic rings. It also contains several nitrogen atoms, which are likely involved in forming various types of interactions with proteins.
Step 2: Notably, the molecule contains several aromatic rings, particularly benzene rings, which are known to interact with certain receptors and transport proteins. This suggests potential binding to proteins that have similar structural motifs.
Step 3: The presence of amide groups (-CONH-) indicates that the molecule could potentially act as a ligand for receptors that bind to peptides or small molecules containing amide groups. Such receptors include G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are often associated with neurotransmitters and hormones.
Step 4: Considering the presence of multiple chiral centers and the overall complexity of the molecule, it may interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP (cytochrome P450) genes, which play crucial roles in the biotransformation of xenobiotics and endogenous compounds.
Step 5: Given the potential interactions with receptors and metabolic enzymes, the molecule could be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and SLC6A4.
