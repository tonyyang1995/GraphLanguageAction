Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc(-c2cn(C)c(=O)c3cnccc23)c(OC)cc1C[NH+](C)C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule contains a quinolone-like structure with an amide group, a benzene ring, and a pyridine moiety. This complex structure is indicative of molecules that could potentially interact with enzymes or receptors involved in neurotransmission or signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a pyridine ring and a quinolone core suggests this molecule might be related to drugs targeting cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP), such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These enzymes are known to metabolize various drugs and endogenous substances, and their activity can significantly influence drug efficacy and toxicity.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a pyrimidine ring and a morphinan-like structure, which could suggest interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Specifically, this pattern might relate to dopamine receptors like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, as well as serotonin receptors like HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, given their common structural motifs.
Step 4: The presence of a benzene ring and a carboxamide group may indicate a potential interaction with enzymes involved in the metabolism of fatty acids or signaling molecules, such as PTGS1 (COX-1/2), which are associated with prostaglandin synthesis. Additionally, this structure could interact with ion channels, such as KCNH2, which is part of the hERG family of potassium channels.
Step 5: Considering the diverse structural elements, this molecule likely has a broad pharmacological profile and could interact with multiple genes and pathways, including those involved in neurotransmission, metabolism, and ion channel function. Therefore, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, PTGS1, and KCNH2. 
Summary of Related Genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, PTGS1, KCNH2.
