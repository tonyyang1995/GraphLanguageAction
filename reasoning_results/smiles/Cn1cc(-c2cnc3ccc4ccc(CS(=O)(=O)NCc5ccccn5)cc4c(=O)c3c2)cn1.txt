Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cn1cc(-c2cnc3ccc4ccc(CS(=O)(=O)NCc5ccccn5)cc4c(=O)c3c2)cn1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with several functional groups including a thiosemicarbazone moiety (CS(=O)(=O)NC), which is a common pharmacophore found in inhibitors of enzymes such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19.
Step 2: The presence of the thiosemicarbazone moiety suggests that the molecule might interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, specifically those encoded by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. These enzymes are involved in the biotransformation of drugs, which could lead to altered pharmacokinetics and potential drug-drug interactions.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an amide group (-CONH-), which are known to form hydrogen bonds with proteins. This could potentially interact with receptors and ion channels, such as those encoded by genes like HTR2A, HTR2B, and KCNH2, which are involved in neurotransmission and cardiac function.
Step 4: The molecule also includes a benzene ring system, which is a common scaffold for many drugs and can interact with various protein targets, including those encoded by genes such as PTGS1 (COX-2), which is involved in inflammation and pain signaling.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and potential interactions described above, the molecule may be related to the following genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, HTR2A, HTR2B, KCNH2, PTGS1.
