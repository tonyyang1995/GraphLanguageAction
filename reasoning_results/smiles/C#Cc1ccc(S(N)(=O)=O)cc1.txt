Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C#Cc1ccc(S(N)(=O)=O)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule with a quinoline core and a nitro group attached to it. The quinoline core is a common scaffold found in many drugs, including those that interact with various receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with an oxygen atom double-bonded to it (N(=O)), which suggests the presence of a nitrile group. This functional group is often associated with molecules that can act as inhibitors of enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a sulfur atom bonded to a nitrogen atom (S(N)), indicating the presence of a sulfonamide group. Sulfonamides are known to bind to various proteins, including enzymes like CYP2C19 and transporters like SLC6A4, which play roles in drug absorption and distribution.
Step 4: Given the structure and functional groups present in the molecule, it is likely to interact with enzymes and receptors involved in drug metabolism and transport. Specifically, it may affect the activity of enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, as well as transporters like SLC6A4.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes are: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and SLC6A4.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
