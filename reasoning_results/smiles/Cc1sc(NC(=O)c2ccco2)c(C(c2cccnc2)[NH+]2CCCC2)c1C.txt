Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1sc(NC(=O)c2ccco2)c(C(c2cccnc2)[NH+]2CCCC2)c1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring system with various functional groups such as amide (N=C=O), ester (O-C-O), amine (N-H), and hydroxyl (-OH) groups. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for similar functional groups.
Step 2: Among the listed genes, several are involved in drug metabolism and transport, which could potentially interact with the molecule due to its complex structure. These include CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, all of which are cytochrome P450 enzymes responsible for metabolizing drugs.
Step 3: Additionally, some genes encode receptors that might bind to the molecule based on its functional groups. For example, HTR2A and HTR2B code for serotonin receptors, which often have binding sites for molecules with amine and amide functionalities.
Step 4: Other genes like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4 code for dopamine receptors, which also have potential binding sites for molecules with similar structures. The presence of amine and amide groups in the molecule could make it a candidate for binding to these receptors.
Step 5: Considering the above points, the related genes are: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
