Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC1CC2(CCCCC2)N2C(=O)C(=O)c3cccc1c32, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings and functional groups such as amide (N-C=O), ester (O-C=O), and aromatic rings. These features suggest the molecule could interact with enzymes or receptors involved in signal transduction or metabolism.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of an amide group and a possible ester group indicate the molecule may be a small molecule ligand or inhibitor. Ligands and inhibitors often target enzymes, transporters, or receptors, which are encoded by the genes listed.
Step 3: The aromatic rings and the overall structure of the molecule suggest it might have pharmacological activity, potentially interacting with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or ion channels, which are known to be encoded by genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, and CACNA1H.
Step 4: Considering the potential for interaction with enzymes, particularly those involved in drug metabolism, the molecule could relate to genes such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which encode cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Step 5: Given the presence of a nitrogen atom in the amide group and the overall complexity of the molecule, it is also plausible that the molecule could interact with GPCRs or other neurotransmitter receptors, linking it to genes such as DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C.
