Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(C2[NH2+]c3ccccc3C(=O)[NH+]2c2ccc(Oc3ccccc3)cc2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with several functional groups including a pyrrole ring, a benzene ring, and amine groups. This suggests that the molecule could interact with proteins that have similar functional groups or are involved in processes regulated by these functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of amine groups and carboxylate groups in the molecule indicates it may be an agonist or antagonist for receptors that have these functional groups in their binding sites, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This aligns with several of the listed genes that code for GPCRs, like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a quinone-like structure, which might interact with enzymes involved in redox reactions or detoxification pathways. Genes such as CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which code for cytochrome P450 enzymes, could be related due to this feature.
Step 4: Given the presence of a benzene ring and amine groups, the molecule could potentially act as a ligand for ion channels, particularly those that are voltage-gated. This could relate to the gene KCNH2, which codes for a potassium channel subunit.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and potential interactions, the most likely related genes from the provided list are ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and KCNH2. These genes are associated with receptors and enzymes that could interact with or be influenced by the given molecule.
