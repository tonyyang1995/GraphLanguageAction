Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N=c1[n-]c(N)c(C(=O)NC(=[NH2+])NCc2ccccc2)nc1Cl, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a negative charge, indicating a potential interaction with anion transporters or receptors.
Step 2: The molecule includes a pyrrole ring system, which could interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as those involved in neurotransmitter signaling.
Step 3: The presence of a carboxamide group and a benzene ring with an amide substituent suggests potential interactions with enzymes like CYP2D6, which metabolizes drugs containing similar functional groups.
Step 4: The overall structure, including the presence of a benzene ring and amide groups, may indicate potential interactions with kinases, such as LCK, which are involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 5: The molecule's structure and functional groups suggest it could interact with multiple targets, but the primary related genes are likely to be CYP2D6, LCK, and possibly other enzymes or receptors involved in neurotransmitter signaling.
Summary of Related Genes: CYP2D6, LCK, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4. Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a negative charge, indicating a potential interaction with anion transporters or receptors.
Summary of Related Genes: CYP2D6, LCK, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4. 
Note: The summary includes additional genes based on the molecule's structure and possible interactions, beyond the direct relationship with CYP2D6 and LCK. Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a negative charge, indicating a potential interaction with anion transporters or receptors.
Step 2: The molecule includes a pyrrole ring system, suggesting possible interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The presence of a carboxamide group and a benzene ring with an amide substituent points to potential interactions with enzymes like CYP2D6.
Step 4: The overall structure hints at possible kinase interactions, particularly with LCK.
Step 5: Given the molecule's structure, key related genes are CYP2D
