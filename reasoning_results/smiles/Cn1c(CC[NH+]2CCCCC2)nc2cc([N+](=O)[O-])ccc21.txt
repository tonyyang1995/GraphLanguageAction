Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cn1c(CC[NH+]2CCCCC2)nc2cc([N+](=O)[O-])ccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that contains several functional groups such as amine (NH2), imine (N=C), carboxylic acid (COOH), and aromatic rings (benzene rings). These structural features suggest the molecule could interact with proteins involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of an amine group (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) indicates potential for binding to receptors that have amino acid binding sites or ion channels. For instance, adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4) often contain amino acid residues that interact with small molecules via hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions.
Step 3: The imine group (-N=C-) suggests the molecule may be capable of forming covalent bonds with cysteine residues in proteins, which is characteristic of certain drug-metabolizing enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Step 4: Given the complexity and size of the molecule, it might also interact with receptors that are involved in G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathways, such as dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) and serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Step 5: Considering the above structural features and their potential interactions with proteins, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6. 
Summary: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
