Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N=c1[n-]nc(S(N)(=O)=O)s1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples.
Step 1: The molecule is an imidazolone derivative that contains a nitro group (-NO2) and a sulfhydryl group (-SH). These functional groups are indicative of potential interactions with proteins involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) suggests that the molecule may interact with enzymes involved in the metabolism of neurotransmitters or other signaling molecules. CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are cytochrome P450 enzymes that metabolize a wide range of drugs and xenobiotics, including those that affect neurotransmitter levels. These enzymes could be directly influenced by the molecule's structure.
Step 3: The sulfhydryl group (-SH) in the molecule could form covalent bonds with cysteine residues in proteins, potentially affecting their activity. This feature might be relevant to the function of several G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which contain cysteine residues in their structures.
Step 4: The molecule's basic nature, indicated by the nitrogen atom, might enable it to interact with ion channels, particularly those that are sensitive to pH changes or are regulated by ligands. CNR1, which encodes for the cannabinoid receptor, and KCNH2, which codes for a voltage-gated potassium channel, are two examples where such interactions could occur.
Step 5: Given the pattern of the molecule and its potential to interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism and receptors that modulate neurotransmission, the related genes include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CNR1, and KCNH2.
