Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(C2[NH2+]c3ccccc3C(=O)[NH+]2c2ccc(NC(C)=O)cc2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple functional groups such as amine, imine, carboxylic acid, and phenyl rings. It also has a quaternary ammonium group and a lactam structure.
Step 2: Considering the structure, this molecule likely acts as an agonist or antagonist for receptors that bind to amine groups or have imine/amine interactions. This suggests potential interactions with receptors that have amine-binding sites, such as adrenergic and cholinergic receptors.
Step 3: The presence of a carboxylic acid and a lactam might indicate that this molecule could be involved in modulating enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYP enzymes), which are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics. CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are examples of enzymes that could interact with this molecule.
Step 4: The molecule’s structure may also influence its interaction with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to its overall shape and functional groups. GPCRs like HTR2A, HTR2B, and HRH1 could potentially be affected by this molecule.
Step 5: Given the above considerations, the related genes are likely to be those encoding receptors and enzymes that interact directly or indirectly with the molecule’s functional groups and structural features. These include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KDR, LCK, PTGS1, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4.
