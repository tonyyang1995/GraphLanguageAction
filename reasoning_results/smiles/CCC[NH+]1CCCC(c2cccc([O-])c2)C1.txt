Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCC[NH+]1CCCC(c2cccc([O-])c2)C1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains an amine group (-NH+) and multiple aromatic rings, which are common features in ligands that interact with receptors such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This suggests the molecule might be involved in signaling pathways regulated by these receptors.
Step 2: The presence of an amine group and the overall molecular structure indicate the molecule could potentially act as a partial agonist or antagonist for GPCRs, particularly those that bind small molecules. GPCRs are often involved in signal transduction pathways mediated by neurotransmitters, hormones, and other signaling molecules.
Step 3: The gene ADRA1D encodes the alpha-1D adrenergic receptor, which is a member of the GPCR family. The molecule's structure and amine group suggest it could interact with this receptor, potentially modulating its activity. Other GPCRs that might be affected include ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, all of which are involved in various signaling pathways.
Step 4: The molecule also includes a carboxylate group (-COO-), which could interact with ion channels or other proteins containing negatively charged residues. CACNA1H encodes the alpha-1H calcium channel, which could be influenced by the molecule's structure. Other potential targets might include KCNH2, which encodes the potassium channel.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and the described interactions, the related genes are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CACNA1H, KCNH2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes are involved in neurotransmission, hormone signaling, and ion channel function, suggesting the molecule may have effects on these biological processes. 
Summary of related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CACNA1H, KCNH2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
