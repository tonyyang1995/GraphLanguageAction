Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc(Cc2c[n-]c(=N)[n-]c2=N)cc(OC)c1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a tricyclic structure with a nitrogen atom in the ring, which is typical of certain ligands that can interact with receptors such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This suggests potential interaction with genes encoding for GPCRs.
Step 2: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) and a nitrile group (-CN) indicates that the molecule might be an inhibitor or activator of enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways. This could relate to genes encoding for enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYP), which are known to metabolize many drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: The molecule also includes an amide group (-CONH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which are common functional groups found in many drugs and can participate in hydrogen bonding and other interactions with proteins. This could suggest a relationship with genes encoding ion channels or transporters, such as SLC family members, which often have binding sites for small molecules.
Step 4: Given the overall structure and functional groups, the molecule could potentially modulate the activity of neurotransmitter receptors, as it contains multiple amines and hydroxyl groups. This suggests possible interaction with genes encoding for neurotransmitter receptors, such as HTR (serotonin receptors), DRD (dopamine receptors), and CHRM (cholinergic receptors).
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the genes related to this molecule include those encoding GPCRs (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HRH1), enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), ion channels/transporters (SLC6A2, SLC6A4), and neurotransmitter receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4). Step 5: Related Gene Names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HRH1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4.
