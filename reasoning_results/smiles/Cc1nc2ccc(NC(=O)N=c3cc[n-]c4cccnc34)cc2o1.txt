Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1nc2ccc(NC(=O)N=c3cc[n-]c4cccnc34)cc2o1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom in its structure, which is part of a heterocyclic ring (indicated by the 'n' in the SMILES string). This feature suggests potential interaction with proteins that have binding sites for nitrogen-containing compounds, such as receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH-) indicates the molecule could interact with proteins containing amide binding sites, such as certain G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The aromatic ring system and the presence of a quinolone-like structure suggest potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4.
Step 4: The overall structure does not directly indicate strong affinity for specific neurotransmitter receptors like those encoded by HTR1A, HTR2A, or DRD2, but it may influence their activity through indirect mechanisms.
Step 5: Given the molecule's structure, it is most likely to be related to genes involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and possibly some receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, DRD2), although direct interaction cannot be confirmed without further analysis.
