Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C=CCSc1nnc(-c2cc3c(-c4ccccc4)nn(C)c3s2)n1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with multiple substituents, including a cyano group (-CN), a trifluoromethyl group (CF3), and a phenyl group (Ph). These structural features suggest potential interactions with enzymes or receptors involved in signal transduction or metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group and a phenyl group could indicate potential binding to proteins such as cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP), which are known to metabolize drugs and xenobiotics, including those with similar functional groups.
Step 3: The molecule's structure may also suggest potential interaction with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), given the presence of aromatic rings that could form hydrogen bonds or π-π stacking interactions with receptor residues.
Step 4: Based on the molecular features identified, the most likely related genes are those encoding for CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and GPCRs (DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B).
Step 5: Summary of related gene names: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B. Step 5: Summary of related gene names: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B.
