Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1onc(-c2ccccc2Cl)c1C(=O)N=c1[n-]nc(Cc2ccc(Cl)cc2)s1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that includes various functional groups such as amide (-CONH-), aromatic ring systems (benzene rings), and halogen substituents (chlorine). This structure suggests the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors involved in signal transduction or drug metabolism.
Step 2: Analyzing the functional groups, particularly the amide group and the presence of benzene rings, indicates potential interactions with enzymes like CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics. These enzymes play crucial roles in the biotransformation of many pharmaceuticals and are often associated with drug resistance mechanisms.
Step 3: The presence of a chlorine atom and the overall structure might also suggest interaction with transporters or receptors such as SLC6A4 (norepinephrine transporter) or DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), given that chlorinated compounds can act as ligands for these proteins. Additionally, the aromatic nature of the molecule could interact with ion channels like KCNH2 (hERG potassium channel).
Step 4: Considering the detailed structure, it's plausible that this molecule could influence neurotransmitter systems through its ability to bind to receptors such as HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A) or HTR2B (serotonin receptor 2B), which are involved in mood regulation and psychiatric disorders.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the most likely related genes are those involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP3A4), neurotransmitter transport and signaling (SLC6A4, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B), and ion channel function (KCNH2). Other genes like ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein) might also be relevant due to their role in drug efflux.
