Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1onc2n1-c1cc(Br)ccc1OC2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing several functional groups such as an oxygen double bond (O=C), a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (N), a bromine atom (Br), and an ester group (OC). The presence of a nitrogen and oxygen double bonds suggests potential for hydrogen bonding and aromatic interactions, which are important for ligand-receptor binding.
Step 2: Given the structure, this molecule could interact with receptors that have specific binding sites for molecules with similar functional groups, particularly those containing nitrogen and oxygen. Receptors that might be involved include those modulated by neurotransmitters and hormones, as well as some that respond to environmental toxins.
Step 3: Looking at the genes provided, those involved in neurotransmitter systems and hormone pathways would be more likely candidates for interaction due to the presence of nitrogen and oxygen. Genes like DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HRH1 encode receptors for dopamine, serotonin, and histamine, respectively, all of which could potentially bind to this molecule.
Step 4: Additionally, the CYP family of genes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) are involved in drug metabolism and could interact with the molecule if it were to be metabolized within the body.
Step 5: Based on the molecule’s structure and the genes listed, the related genes are: DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HRH1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. These genes encode receptors and enzymes that could interact with or be affected by the molecule.
