Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)(C)c1n[n-]c(=NC(=O)c2cc(-c3ccccc3)nc3ccccc23)s1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure containing multiple functional groups such as amine (N), carboxyl (C=O), and aromatic rings (cyclohexane). It also contains a nitrogen atom in a ring system, which is part of a nitro group (-[n-]).
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group (C=O-NH) suggests the molecule could act as an inhibitor or activator of enzymes that interact with this functional group, such as dehydrogenases or amidases. This could potentially affect the expression or activity of genes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The aromatic rings and nitrogen-containing heterocycles suggest the molecule might have binding affinity for receptors or ion channels, particularly those with similar structures. For example, it could interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 4: Given the potential for interaction with GPCRs and the presence of a nitro group, the molecule may also be relevant to serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) due to their common binding sites for various ligands.
Step 5: The complex structure with multiple functional groups indicates the molecule could influence multiple signaling pathways. Therefore, the genes related to the molecule are likely to include those involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction, such as DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, PTGS1, and KDR.
