Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C=CC(=O)Nc1cc2c(=Nc3ccc(F)c(Cl)c3)[n-]cnc2cc1C#CC(C)(C)[NH+]1CC[NH+](C)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure containing multiple functional groups such as an amide (C=CC(=O)), a pyrrolidine ring (c1cc2c(=Nc3ccc(F)c(Cl)c3)[n-]), a phenyl group (C#CC(C)(C)), and several nitrogen atoms (N, [NH+], [NH+]). This structure suggests the molecule could interact with proteins that have binding sites for these functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of a pyrrolidine ring and nitrogen atoms indicates potential interactions with receptors that bind small molecules or ligands, such as adrenergic and cholinergic receptors. This is supported by the presence of adrenergic receptor genes (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and cholinergic receptor genes (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4) in the list.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a phenyl group, which is known to be involved in binding to certain enzymes and receptors. This feature aligns with the presence of cytochrome P450 genes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are involved in drug metabolism and could potentially interact with the molecule.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a quinoline-like structure (as seen in the N-capped pyrrolidine) may suggest interaction with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Genes associated with GPCRs include HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and HRH1, which are listed in the provided gene list.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes including those encoding for adrenergic and cholinergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), and GPCRs (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1).
