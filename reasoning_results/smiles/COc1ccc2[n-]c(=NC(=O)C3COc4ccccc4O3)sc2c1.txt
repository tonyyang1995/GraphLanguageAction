Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc2[n-]c(=NC(=O)C3COc4ccccc4O3)sc2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a tricyclic structure with a nitrogen atom that is part of a heterocyclic ring, which is typical for many ligands that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This suggests the molecule could potentially bind to or modulate the activity of GPCRs.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) and an amide group (-CONH-) in the molecule indicates it may have electrophilic or nucleophilic properties, respectively, which are important for binding to enzymes or receptors.
Step 3: Given the pattern of the molecule, it might interact with receptors like DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), HTR1A (Serotonin receptor 1A), and HTR2A (Serotonin receptor 2A), all of which are GPCRs involved in neurotransmission.
Step 4: The molecule's structure also hints at potential interactions with enzymes such as CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes include: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.
Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4 Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure including multiple rings and functional groups, suggesting it could interact with various biological targets.
Step 2: The presence of a heterocyclic ring with a nitrogen atom indicates the molecule may target G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The amide and cyano groups suggest the molecule could interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP enzymes.
Step 4: Given the likely interactions with GPCRs and enzymes, the related genes include those encoding receptors and metabolic enzymes.
Step 5: Based on the molecule’s structure, the related genes are: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.
- CYP3A4
Note: While the molecule's structure suggests potential interactions with these genes, actual biological effects would need to be confirmed through experimental studies. The list provided includes only the genes that align with the structural features described. Other genes listed initially (e.g., ABCB1, ABL1) do not have direct structural alignment with the given molecule based on the provided information. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings and functional groups, indicating potential interactions with various biological targets.
Step 2: The presence of a heterocyclic ring with a nitrogen atom suggests the molecule may target G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The amide and cyano groups indicate possible interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, particularly CYP enzymes.
Step 5: Based on the molecule’s structure, the related genes are: DRD
