Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=S(=O)(c1ccccc1)c1cnn(-c2ccccc2)c1-c1ccc(F)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a sulfonamide group (O=S(=O)) and a benzene ring system with multiple nitrogen-containing heterocycles (c1ccccc1). This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, particularly those encoded by CYP (Cytochrome P450) genes such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 2: The presence of aromatic rings and heteroatoms (F, N) indicates possible binding to receptors or ion channels, which could be related to genes encoding for various G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a pyrrole ring (c1cnn) and a furan ring (c1-c1ccc(F)cc1), which may interact with genes involved in neurotransmitter transport and signaling pathways, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 4: The presence of a benzene ring system and a fluorine atom (F) might suggest potential interactions with voltage-gated calcium channels, which are encoded by genes like CACNA1H.
Step 5: Given the complex structure and potential for interaction with multiple systems, the molecule is likely related to several genes including CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and CACNA1H.
