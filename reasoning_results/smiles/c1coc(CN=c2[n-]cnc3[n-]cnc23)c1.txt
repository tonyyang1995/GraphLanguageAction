Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: c1coc(CN=c2[n-]cnc3[n-]cnc23)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string (c1coc(CN=c2[n-]cnc3[n-]cnc23)c1) describes a molecule that contains several key structural features such as aromatic rings, a nitrogen atom with negative charge, and a benzene ring with a cyano group (-CN). The presence of a negatively charged nitrogen and a cyano group suggests that this molecule may interact with ion channels or receptors that have specific binding sites for these functional groups.
Step 2: Among the listed genes, those involved in ion channel function are likely to be relevant due to the molecule's structural features. For instance, KCNH2 encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel, and CACNA1H encodes a calcium channel. Both types of channels could potentially interact with the molecule given its aromatic and charged functionalities.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule's structure might also influence the activity of neurotransmitter receptors. Genes such as HTR2A (serotonin receptor), HTR2B, and HTR2C (all serotonin receptors) could be influenced by the presence of the cyano group, which might modulate their affinity or efficacy.
Step 4: Considering the molecular weight and the presence of a benzene ring, the molecule could also interact with enzymes that metabolize drugs or xenobiotics. Genes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are known to encode cytochrome P450 enzymes, which could metabolize the molecule, thereby affecting its pharmacological profile.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names based on the above analysis, the genes potentially related to the described molecule include: KCNH2, CACNA1H, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
