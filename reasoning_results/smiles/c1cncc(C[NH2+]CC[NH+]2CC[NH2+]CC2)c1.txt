Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: c1cncc(C[NH2+]CC[NH+]2CC[NH2+]CC2)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this relationship might be clinically relevant.
Step 1: The molecule contains a tricyclic core structure with a nitrogen atom substituted in the aromatic ring, which is characteristic of many drugs that interact with receptors and ion channels. This structure suggests potential interactions with genes encoding receptors or ion channels.
Step 2: The molecule also includes amine groups (NH2) and positively charged nitrogen atoms (NH+), indicating it could act as a ligand for receptors that bind to basic residues, such as those encoded by G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) genes.
Step 3: Given the presence of multiple aromatic rings and the potential for hydrogen bonding due to the amine groups, the molecule could interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP (cytochrome P450) genes.
Step 4: The molecule’s structure may allow it to interact with GPCRs, which are encoded by genes like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, as well as other receptors like CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structural features, it is likely to be related to the following genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4.
