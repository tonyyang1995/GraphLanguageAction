Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([NH+]1CCC(n2nc(-c3ccccc3)oc2=O)CC1)C1(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule contains a quinolone-like structure with a pyridine ring fused to an imidazole ring. This type of molecular structure is often found in compounds that interact with receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of amide groups and aromatic rings suggests potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are known to be modulated by various ligands including drugs and neurotransmitters. Specific GPCRs such as HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are involved in serotonin signaling, could be targets for this molecule due to their binding sites for ligands.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a benzene ring with substituents like chlorine, which are common in drug design to enhance lipophilicity and improve pharmacokinetic properties. This structural feature might facilitate binding to other receptors or enzymes that require hydrophobic interactions, such as those found in the dopamine signaling pathway, like DRD2 and DRD3.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a nitrile group (-CN) and a carbonyl group (C=O) indicates the molecule may have inhibitory effects on enzymes like CYP2D6, which metabolizes many drugs and endogenous compounds, and PTGS1 (COX-1/COX-2), which are involved in inflammation and pain modulation.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the most likely related genes are those involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction, specifically: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, CYP2D6, and PTGS1.
Summary of Related Genes:
- HTR1A
