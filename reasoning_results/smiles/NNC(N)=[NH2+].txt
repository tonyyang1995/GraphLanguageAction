Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NNC(N)=[NH2+], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string NNC(N)=[NH2+] is an amide-based compound containing a nitrogen-nitrogen double bond and a positively charged amino group. This structure suggests potential interactions with receptors or enzymes that have specific binding sites for such functional groups.
Step 2: Considering the molecular structure, the positively charged amino group could interact with acidic residues on protein surfaces, particularly those found in ion channels or receptors. For example, it might bind to protonated histidine residues, which are common in G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: Among the listed genes, several are associated with GPCRs, including HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode serotonin receptors. These receptors often have regions rich in basic amino acids that can form electrostatic interactions with charged ligands like the positively charged amino group in the molecule.
Step 4: Another gene of interest is CYP2D6, which encodes a cytochrome P450 enzyme involved in the metabolism of various drugs and xenobiotics. The presence of a nitrogen-nitrogen double bond and an amino group could suggest potential substrate recognition by this enzyme.
Step 5: Therefore, the molecule may be related to the genes encoding serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) and the CYP2D6 gene, given its structural features and potential interaction patterns.
Summary of related gene names:
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- HTR6
- CYP2D6 Step 5: Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2D6
These genes are likely to be related to the given molecule due to their involvement in receptor binding and drug metabolism processes.
