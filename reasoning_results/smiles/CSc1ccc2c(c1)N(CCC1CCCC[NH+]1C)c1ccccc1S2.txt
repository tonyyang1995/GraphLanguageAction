Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CSc1ccc2c(c1)N(CCC1CCCC[NH+]1C)c1ccccc1S2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a complex structure including a benzene ring, a pyrrole ring, a nitrogen atom with a positive charge, and sulfur atoms. These features suggest the molecule could be an agonist or inhibitor for receptors that interact with these functional groups.
Step 2: Among the provided genes, those encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and HRH1, are particularly relevant due to their involvement in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways.
Step 3: The presence of a positively charged nitrogen and sulfur groups in the molecule might interact with negatively charged residues in the receptor binding pockets of the aforementioned GPCRs, influencing their activity.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's aromatic rings and overall shape may facilitate binding to specific GPCR subtypes, potentially modulating their function.
Step 5: Based on the molecular features described, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and HRH1.
