Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [NH3+]CCOB(c1ccccc1)c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a quaternary ammonium group (-NH3+) attached to a benzene ring (CC), which is connected to a cytosine moiety (O) and a phenyl ring (B). This structure suggests the molecule may have a basic nature and could interact with ion channels or receptors that are sensitive to basic compounds.
Step 2: The presence of a phenyl ring (B) and multiple aromatic rings (c1ccccc1) indicates potential interactions with enzymes or proteins that contain aromatic residues, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP family).
Step 3: The molecule's overall structure, including the quaternary ammonium group and aromatic rings, might be involved in binding to receptors that are activated by ligands with similar structural features, such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 4: Given the presence of a cytosine moiety and potential for interaction with aromatic residues, the molecule could also interact with enzymes like CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism and have aromatic amino acid residues in their active sites.
Step 5: Considering the molecule's potential for binding to ion channels and receptors, it might influence the activity of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and DRD2, which are known to bind to various ligands including neurotransmitters and other small molecules.
Summary of related gene names: 
- ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2
- CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4
- CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2
Note: The summary does not include all possible genes due to space constraints but highlights the key ones based on the molecule's structure. Other genes might also be relevant depending on more detailed analysis.
