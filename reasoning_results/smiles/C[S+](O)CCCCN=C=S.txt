Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[S+](O)CCCCN=C=S, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a sulfur atom (S) that is positively charged, indicating it is a sulfonium ion. This functional group is often involved in interactions with proteins, particularly those that have binding sites for positively charged groups or can form hydrogen bonds.
Step 2: The molecule contains a thioether linkage (-S-), which can form hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues containing hydroxyl groups or amide nitrogens, such as serine, threonine, and asparagine. These interactions are important for protein-ligand binding.
Step 3: The presence of a phenolic oxygen (O) and an ester group (C=O) suggests potential for hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. These functional groups are commonly found in ligands that interact with receptors like GPCRs (G protein-coupled receptors).
Step 4: Given the complexity of the molecule and its functional groups, it likely interacts with multiple genes involved in signal transduction pathways, neurotransmission, and inflammation. Genes encoding receptors for neurotransmitters and hormones, as well as enzymes involved in metabolism, could be relevant.
Step 5: Based on the molecule’s structure and potential interactions, the related genes might include those encoding GPCRs, such as HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A), HTR2B (serotonin receptor 2B), HTR2C (serotonin receptor 2C), DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), DRD3 (dopamine receptor D3), DRD4 (dopamine receptor D4), and HRH1 (histamine receptor H1). Additionally, genes involved in metabolic pathways, such as CYP2D6 (cytochrome P450 2D6), CYP2C19 (cytochrome P450 2C19), and PTGS1 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1), could also be relevant.
