Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [NH3+]CCC[NH2+]CCCC[NH2+]CCCNC(=O)Cc1cccc2ccccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a series of aromatic rings, including benzene rings, which are common in many drugs that interact with receptors and enzymes. The presence of multiple nitrogen atoms, particularly in positively charged groups (e.g., [NH3+]), indicates potential interactions with proteins containing basic amino acid residues.
Step 2: The molecule has several functional groups such as amides (-CONH2) and esters (C(=O)O), which are known to form hydrogen bonds and other types of non-covalent interactions with proteins. These functional groups can bind to specific sites on receptors or enzymes, affecting their activity.
Step 3: Given the complex structure and the presence of multiple aromatic rings and functional groups, this molecule could potentially interact with various genes encoding for receptors, transporters, and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways. For instance, it might interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions.
Step 4: Considering the molecular features described, the molecule may be related to genes encoding receptors such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes encode for GPCRs that are involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release and signaling. Additionally, it might interact with CYP2D6, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of various drugs.
Step 5: The molecule could also be related to PTGS1, which encodes cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), an enzyme involved in prostaglandin synthesis, and SLC6A4, which encodes the serotonin transporter. Both of these proteins play crucial roles in neurotransmission and could be affected by the molecule's interactions.
