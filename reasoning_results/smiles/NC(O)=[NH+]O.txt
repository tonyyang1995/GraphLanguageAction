Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NC(O)=[NH+]O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string NC(O)=[NH+]O is an amide containing a positively charged nitrogen atom. This structure suggests it is likely a small organic molecule that could interact with receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmission or signaling pathways.
Step 2: Considering the positively charged nitrogen, this molecule might be able to form hydrogen bonds or electrostatic interactions with negatively charged groups on proteins, such as amino acid residues like glutamate or aspartate. This feature could make it relevant to genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or ion channels.
Step 3: Specific to GPCRs, the molecule's amide functionality and positive charge suggest it may interact with receptors like adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) or muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), which are known to have positively charged sites for ligand binding.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure might also interact with receptors that are involved in neurotransmitter signaling, such as dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) and serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), further supporting its potential relevance to these genes.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the molecule is most likely to be related to genes encoding adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), and serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6). These genes are involved in various signaling pathways and neurotransmission processes. 
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
