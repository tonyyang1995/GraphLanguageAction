Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Fc1ccc2c(c1)C1C=CCC1C(c1cc3c(cc1Br)OCO3)[NH2+]2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a fluorine atom (F) and a bromine atom (Br), indicating potential for interactions with proteins involved in signaling pathways or transport mechanisms.
Step 2: The presence of aromatic rings and a quaternary ammonium group suggests possible interactions with receptors or ion channels, particularly those that bind small molecules or ions.
Step 3: The molecule includes a phenolic hydroxyl group (OH) and an amide group (-CONH2), which could interact with enzymes or receptors that have active sites containing polar groups.
Step 4: The structure includes a benzene ring with a cyano group (-CN), which might interact with proteins involved in cellular signaling or metabolism.
Step 5: Given the structural features, the molecule may be related to genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (e.g., CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1) and enzymes (e.g., CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Related gene names: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
