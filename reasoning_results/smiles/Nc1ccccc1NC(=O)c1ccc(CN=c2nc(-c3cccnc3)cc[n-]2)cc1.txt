Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Nc1ccccc1NC(=O)c1ccc(CN=c2nc(-c3cccnc3)cc[n-]2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex molecule with multiple functional groups, including an amide (N-C=O), a benzene ring, and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle. The presence of a benzene ring suggests that this molecule could interact with proteins involved in cell signaling and receptor activation, which are often associated with aromatic ligands.
Step 2: The nitrogen-containing heterocycle, likely a pyrrole or pyridine ring, can form hydrogen bonds and π-π stacking interactions, which are important for binding to receptors such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature may indicate potential interactions with GPCRs encoded by genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 3: The amide group (-CO-NH-) is a common site for conjugation with enzymes and can participate in various biological processes, including metabolism. This feature might suggest that the molecule could be metabolized by enzymes encoded by genes such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: The overall structure does not directly indicate any strong interaction with genes encoding for kinases (e.g., LCK, MCL1) or other proteins involved in signal transduction pathways (e.g., PTGS1, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4), suggesting that the molecule is less likely to have a direct relationship with these genes.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is more likely to be related to genes involved in neurotransmitter systems and metabolism. The related gene names include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These genes encode receptors and enzymes that play crucial roles in neurotransmission and drug metabolism.
