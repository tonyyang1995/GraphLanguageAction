Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])Cc1ccc(NC(=O)C2CCCCC2C(=O)[O-])cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyridine ring, a thiazole ring, and an oxazole ring. These functional groups are often involved in interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are encoded by genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and HTR1A-HTR6. The presence of these rings suggests potential interaction sites for these receptors.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a carboxylic acid group and an amide group. These functional groups are commonly found in ligands that interact with enzymes and transport proteins. Genes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and SLC6A2 are involved in drug metabolism and transport, making them potential targets for this molecule.
Step 3: The molecule has a quinoline-like structure, which can interact with ion channels. Gene CNTRNA1H is associated with calcium channels, indicating a possible interaction with this molecule.
Step 4: The molecule’s overall structure does not directly suggest strong interactions with other genes listed, such as ABCB1, ABL1, CDK2, EGFR, ESR1, FLT1, HRH1, KDR, LCK, MCL1, OPKR1, PPARG, PTGS1, SIGMAR1, and SL6A4, as it lacks typical binding motifs for these proteins.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule may be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and SLC6A2. 
Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, SLC6A2.
