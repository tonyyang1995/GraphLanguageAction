Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc(C)n(-c2nc(=NC(C)C)[n-]c(=NC(C)C)[n-]2)n1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with a benzene ring containing a nitrogen atom (N), which is part of a pyrrole ring, and a series of other substituents including a cyano group (-CN) and a nitro group (-NO2). This structure suggests that the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: Looking at the genes listed, several are known to be involved in drug metabolism pathways. For example, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 are all cytochrome P450 enzymes that metabolize a wide range of drugs. CYP3A4 is another major drug-metabolizing enzyme. These genes encode enzymes that could potentially interact with the described molecule due to its potential to inhibit or modulate their activity.
Step 3: Other genes like ABCB1 (encoding P-glycoprotein) are also involved in drug transport and could be affected by the presence of this molecule, as it might alter the efflux of drugs from cells.
Step 4: Considering the neurotransmitter receptors and signaling pathways, genes such as DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C (encoding dopamine and serotonin receptors respectively) could be influenced by the molecule if it interacts with these receptors or their signaling pathways.
Step 5: Lastly, the molecule’s potential to affect ion channels (like KCNH2 encoding hERG potassium channel) could relate to genes such as KCNQ1, KCNH2, and others that encode voltage-gated potassium channels, though the provided list does not include these specific genes.
Summary of Related Genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ABCB1, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C.
