Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC[NH+](CC)S(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N(C)Cc2ccc(C(F)(F)F)cc2)nc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring (N with five substituents) and a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2). These structural features are often found in drugs that interact with receptors and ion channels.
Step 2: The presence of fluorine atoms (F) in the molecule suggests it may have been designed for selective binding to specific targets due to their unique electronic properties, which can modulate receptor activity.
Step 3: The pattern of aromatic rings (benzene rings) and heterocycles (pyrrolidine) indicates potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are known to be involved in many signaling pathways and are targeted by various drugs.
Step 4: Given the molecule's structure, it could potentially interact with genes encoding for receptors such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, as these encode for receptors that bind to ligands with similar structures.
Step 5: The molecule might also interact with CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) due to its functional groups, which could affect drug metabolism.
