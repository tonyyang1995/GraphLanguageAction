Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc(N=c2nc(N=c3ccc4c([n-]3)NC(=O)C(C)(C)O4)c(F)c[n-]2)cc(OC)c1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule contains several functional groups and substructures that are indicative of its potential biological activity. Notably, it has a pyrrole ring system, a benzene ring, and a nitrile group (-CN). These features suggest the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors involved in neurotransmission, metabolism, or cell signaling.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrile group and the overall molecular complexity hint at possible interactions with enzymes such as CYP2D6, which metabolizes numerous drugs including those containing nitrile groups. Additionally, the presence of amide groups (e.g., NC(=O)C) suggests potential binding to proteins that interact with amides, like G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: Given the structural features, the molecule may have affinity for receptors that are known to interact with amides and nitriles, such as DRD2 (Dopamine Receptor D2), HTR2A (Serotonin Receptor 2A), and HTR2B (Serotonin Receptor 2B). These receptors are involved in neurotransmission and are known targets for various psychiatric and neurological conditions.
Step 4: The molecule’s structure also suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are known to metabolize many pharmaceuticals and xenobiotics.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the related genes include: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, DRD2, HTR2A, and HTR2B. 
Summary of related genes: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B.
