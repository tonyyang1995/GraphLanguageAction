Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCc1cccc(CC)c1NC(=O)C[NH+](CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex structure containing a benzene ring system, a quinoline-like heterocycle, and a series of alkyl chains. It also has an amide group (-CONH) and a carboxylate ion (-COO-). These features suggest the molecule could be involved in interactions with proteins that have similar chemical moieties or binding sites.
Step 2: The presence of a quinoline-like heterocycle and an amide group suggests the molecule might interact with enzymes that metabolize drugs or small molecules. This aligns with several genes listed, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are known to encode cytochrome P450 enzymes that oxidize various substrates including drugs.
Step 3: The carboxylate ion (-COO-) indicates the molecule could be an acid or a salt, which may affect its pharmacological properties. This feature is relevant to genes encoding receptors or transporters that respond to acidic conditions, like SLC6A2 and SLC6A4, which are sodium-dependent neurotransmitter transporters.
Step 4: The benzene ring system and alkyl chains suggest the molecule might have a hydrophobic core, which could influence its binding to membrane proteins. Genes such as ABCB1 (encoding P-glycoprotein), ABL1 (encoding a tyrosine kinase), and LCK (a lymphocyte-specific protein-tyrosine kinase) are associated with proteins that often have hydrophobic domains and are involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 5: Given the complexity and the potential for multiple interactions, the molecule is likely to be related to a few key genes rather than a single one. The related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, ABCB1, ABL1, and LCK. These genes are involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmitter transport, and signal transduction processes. 
Summary of related genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, ABCB1, ABL1, LCK.
