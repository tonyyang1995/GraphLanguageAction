Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(Cn2cc(C(=O)[O-])c(=O)c3ccccc32)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure containing multiple functional groups such as a carbonyl group (C=O), amide (-CO-NH2), phenyl rings (c-c), and a negatively charged nitroso group (-N(-)-O-). These structural elements suggest potential interactions with enzymes and receptors involved in drug metabolism and signaling pathways.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-CO-NH2) indicates that this molecule could be a potential substrate for enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize amides. These enzymes are part of the cytochrome P450 family and play a crucial role in the biotransformation of many drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: The molecule also contains aromatic rings, which might interact with various G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Specifically, the presence of phenyl rings could potentially bind to adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 4: The negatively charged nitroso group (-N(-)-O-) suggests that the molecule may have affinity for ion channels or transporters. For instance, it could interact with voltage-gated potassium channels (KCNH2) or neurotransmitter transporters like SLC6A2 and SLC6A4.
Step 5: Given the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, KCNH2, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4. These genes encode proteins that are directly involved in the metabolism, signaling, and transport processes relevant to the molecule's structure.
