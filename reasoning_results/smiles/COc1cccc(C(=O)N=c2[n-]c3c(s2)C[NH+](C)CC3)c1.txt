Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cccc(C(=O)N=c2[n-]c3c(s2)C[NH+](C)CC3)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is common in many drug-like molecules and can interact with various receptors and transporters.
Step 2: The presence of a quinoline ring and a pyridine ring, along with a carboxamide group, suggests potential interactions with enzymes like CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a nitrophenyl group, which could interact with certain ion channels or receptors, possibly relating to genes such as HRH1 or HTR2A.
Step 4: The overall structure may suggest potential binding to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), given the presence of aromatic rings and amide groups, which are common in ligands for these receptors. This could be relevant to genes like DRD2 or HTR2B.
Step 5: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the amide group and a positively charged guanidino group might indicate interaction with ion channels or transporters, potentially linking to genes like SLC6A2 or SLC6A4.
