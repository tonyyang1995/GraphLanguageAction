Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NC(=O)c1cccnc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule, NC(=O)c1cccnc1, represents a N-oxoacetylanthranilic acid derivative. This structure contains a nitrogen atom double-bonded to an oxygen (N=O), which is characteristic of amide or nitrile groups, and a benzene ring system.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and the amide functionality suggest that this molecule could interact with enzymes involved in metabolism and drug transport. Specifically, it might be metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP) due to its aromatic structure and amide group.
Step 3: Among the listed genes, those encoding CYP enzymes are directly relevant. These include CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, all of which are involved in the biotransformation of xenobiotics and drugs. The molecule’s potential for interaction with these enzymes is due to its chemical structure, which aligns with known substrates for these enzymes.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule may influence G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to its amide and aromatic features. Genes such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which encode dopamine receptors, and HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which encode serotonin receptors, might be affected. These receptors are known to bind ligands with similar structures to the molecule.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the related genes include:
- CYP1A2
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
- DRD2
- DRD3
- DRD4
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
These genes are relevant due to their roles in metabolism and signaling pathways that could be impacted by the molecule's chemical structure.
