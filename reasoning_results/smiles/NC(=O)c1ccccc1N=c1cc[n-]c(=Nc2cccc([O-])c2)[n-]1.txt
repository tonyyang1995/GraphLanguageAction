Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NC(=O)c1ccccc1N=c1cc[n-]c(=Nc2cccc([O-])c2)[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring system attached to an amide group, which suggests potential interactions with receptors that have similar structural features. This includes G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and neurotransmitter receptors.
Step 2: The presence of nitrogen atoms within the ring system and the overall structure hint at the possibility of the molecule being a ligand for receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), cholinergic receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), and dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4).
Step 3: The molecule also features a carboxylate group, which could interact with ion channels or transporters. This is relevant to genes encoding potassium channels (KCNH2) and possibly other ion channel proteins.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of aromatic rings and nitrogen-containing heterocycles may suggest potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are encoded by the corresponding genes.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, KCNH2, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
