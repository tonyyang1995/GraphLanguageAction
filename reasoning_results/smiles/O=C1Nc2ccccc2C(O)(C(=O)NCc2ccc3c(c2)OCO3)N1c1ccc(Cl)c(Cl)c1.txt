Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C1Nc2ccccc2C(O)(C(=O)NCc2ccc3c(c2)OCO3)N1c1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with multiple substituents, including a nitro group (NO2), a cyano group (CN), and a hydroxyl group (OH). These structural features suggest potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, particularly those encoded by CYP (cytochrome P450) genes.
Step 2: Notably, the molecule has a cyano group and a carboxylic acid ester (C(=O)O) moiety, which are characteristic of substrates for CYP2C19 and CYP2D6. These enzymes are responsible for metabolizing drugs such as antidepressants, anti-inflammatory agents, and anticoagulants.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a benzene ring with an attached amino group (N) indicates possible interactions with neurotransmitter receptors, specifically those encoded by HTR (serotonin receptor) and DRD (dopamine receptor) genes. For instance, the molecule might interact with HTR2A and HTR2C, which are involved in regulating mood and anxiety.
Step 4: Furthermore, the molecule's structure may influence the activity of kinases, such as LCK and PTGS1, given the presence of aromatic rings and polar functional groups that could modulate kinase function through direct binding or allosteric inhibition.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and its potential interactions with various enzyme systems and receptor proteins, the related genes include CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A, HTR2C, LCK, and PTGS1.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- HTR2A
- HTR2C
- LCK
- PTGS1 To provide more context, let's briefly explain the relationship between the molecule and these genes:
- **CYP2C19 and CYP2D6**: These enzymes are primarily involved in the metabolism of drugs. The presence of a cyano group and a carboxylic acid ester suggests that the molecule is likely a substrate for these enzymes, potentially affecting their activity and drug efficacy.
- **HTR2A and HTR2C**: These genes encode serotonin receptors, which play a crucial role in mood regulation and anxiety. The aromatic ring and amino group in the molecule might interact with these receptors, influencing their function.
- **LCK**: This gene encodes a tyrosine kinase that is involved in signal transduction pathways. The molecule's structure, with its aromatic rings and polar groups, could interact with LCK, potentially affecting its activity.
- **PTGS1**: This gene encodes cyclooxygenase-1, an enzyme involved in the production of prostaglandins. The presence of aromatic rings and polar functional groups in the molecule might modulate PTGS1 activity, impacting inflammatory responses. 
These interactions highlight the molecule's potential impact on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, making it relevant to several genes involved in drug metabolism and receptor signaling.
