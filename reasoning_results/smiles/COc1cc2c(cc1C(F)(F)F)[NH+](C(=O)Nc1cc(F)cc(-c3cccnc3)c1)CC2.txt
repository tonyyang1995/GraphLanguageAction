Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc2c(cc1C(F)(F)F)[NH+](C(=O)Nc1cc(F)cc(-c3cccnc3)c1)CC2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with multiple fluorine substituents (F), a pyridine ring, and a quinoline-like structure. These structural features are indicative of drugs that may interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a quinoline-like structure and the presence of multiple fluorines suggest potential interactions with enzymes involved in Phase I and Phase II metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP enzymes (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Step 3: The molecule also includes a carboxamide group (-CONH2) which could potentially interact with receptors or transporters that bind small molecules with this functional group. This suggests possible interactions with genes encoding for receptors or transporters such as DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), HTR2A (Serotonin receptor 5-HT2A), and SLC6A4 (Solute carrier family 6 member 4).
Step 4: The presence of a pyridine ring and the overall structure hint at the possibility of interactions with ion channels and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Genes like KCNH2 (Potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2) and HRH1 (Histamine H1 receptor) might be relevant due to their involvement in ion channel function and GPCR signaling, respectively.
Step 5: Considering the broad range of metabolic and receptor interactions suggested by the molecule's structure, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, KCNH2, HRH1, SLC6A4.
