Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(CN(CC[NH+](C)C)c2ccccn2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that includes a benzene ring system with a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (pyrrole) and a nitro group. This structure suggests the molecule could have pharmacological activity, particularly due to its potential to interact with receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmission and metabolism.
Step 2: Analyzing the structure further, the presence of a pyrrole ring and a nitro group are common in molecules that can act as ligands for various receptors and transport proteins. The nitro group is known to be involved in interactions with enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYP enzymes), which are listed among the provided genes.
Step 3: The molecule's structure also indicates potential interactions with ion channels or transporters, given the presence of aromatic rings and possibly charged groups. This could relate to genes encoding for ion channels or neurotransmitter transporters such as DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and SLC6A2.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's overall structure might suggest it could modulate enzymes involved in drug metabolism, aligning with the CYP family of genes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Step 5: Considering the detailed structure and functional groups, the molecule is likely to interact with several of the provided genes, including those involved in neurotransmission (e.g., DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, SLC6A2) and drug metabolism (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2
- DRD3
- DRD4
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- HTR6
- SLC6A2
- CYP1A2
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
These genes are primarily involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism pathways, which are relevant to the molecule's potential pharmacological effects.
