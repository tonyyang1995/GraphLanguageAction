Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CSc1nc(=NC2CCCC2)c([N+](=O)[O-])c([NH2+]C2CCCC2)[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound that includes several functional groups such as amine, imine, amide, and ester. The presence of these functional groups suggests that the molecule could interact with proteins that have binding sites for similar functional groups.
Step 2: Notably, the molecule contains an amide group (-CO-NH-) which is often found in ligands that bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are known to be involved in various signaling pathways and are associated with many diseases. The amide group in the molecule may allow it to interact with GPCRs.
Step 3: Among the listed genes, several are related to GPCRs. These include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes encode for different subtypes of GPCRs, suggesting that the molecule might interact with one or more of these receptors.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule has an imine group (C=N) which could potentially form hydrogen bonds or other interactions with charged residues on protein surfaces. This structural feature could contribute to binding affinity with certain proteins, including some of those encoded by the listed genes.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes are primarily associated with GPCR function and signaling pathways, making them the most probable targets for the described molecule.
