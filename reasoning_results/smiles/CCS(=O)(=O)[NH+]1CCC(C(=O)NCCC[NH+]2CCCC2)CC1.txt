Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCS(=O)(=O)[NH+]1CCC(C(=O)NCCC[NH+]2CCCC2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a core structure of a benzene ring with various substituents including an acetyl group, amide linkages, and a positively charged nitrogen atom. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for similar chemical moieties.
Step 2: The positively charged nitrogen (ammonium group) indicates the molecule could interact with ion channels or receptors that have negatively charged binding pockets, such as those found in G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The presence of acetyl groups and amide linkages suggests the molecule may be involved in enzyme inhibition, particularly those enzymes that contain catalytic sites for acetylation or amidation reactions, such as certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP enzymes).
Step 4: The molecule's structure does not directly suggest a strong interaction with kinases or other signaling molecules listed in the genes, but it could potentially modulate their activity through indirect mechanisms.
Step 5: Based on the structural features, the molecule is most likely related to genes encoding GPCRs and enzymes involved in metabolic pathways, specifically CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. Step 5: Summary of related gene names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
