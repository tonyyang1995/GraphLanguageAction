Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains multiple functional groups such as amide, alcohol, phenol, and heterocyclic rings. These structural features suggest potential interactions with enzymes and receptors involved in signal transduction pathways and drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (NC(=O)) indicates possible interaction with enzymes like CYP2D6, which metabolizes amine-containing drugs, and CYP2C9, which metabolizes both amine and hydroxyl-containing substrates.
Step 3: The phenolic group (-OH) in the molecule may interact with esterases and other enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C19.
Step 4: The presence of a benzene ring with substituents (e.g., -F) suggests potential binding to receptors that interact with aromatic ligands, such as DRD2 and HTR2A.
Step 5: The overall structure hints at potential modulation of neurotransmitter systems, making genes like DRD2, HTR2A, and HTR2B relevant.
