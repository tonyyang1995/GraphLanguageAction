Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N=c1nc(-c2ccccc2)[n-][n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The SMILES string N=c1nc(-c2ccccc2)[n-][n-]1 represents a molecule that contains a nitrile (N#C) functional group, two negatively charged nitrogen atoms ([n-]), and an aromatic ring system. The presence of the nitrile group and the negatively charged nitrogens suggests this molecule could potentially interact with proteins involved in ion transport or signaling pathways.
Step 2: The molecule's structure indicates it might have the ability to modulate ion channels or receptors due to its charge distribution and potential for hydrogen bonding. This aligns with the functions of several genes listed, such as KCNH2 (potassium channel subfamily H member 2), which encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel, and HRH1 (histamine H1 receptor).
Step 3: The negatively charged nitrogens in the molecule could also interact with positively charged residues in protein binding sites, possibly affecting the activity of enzymes or receptors that have acidic or basic amino acid residues in their active sites. Genes like CYP2D6 (cytochrome P450 2D6) and CYP2C9 (cytochrome P450 2C9) are involved in drug metabolism and could be influenced by this interaction.
Step 4: Given the aromatic nature of the molecule, it may also interact with proteins that contain aromatic amino acids in their binding pockets, such as HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A), which plays a role in neurotransmission. Additionally, the nitrile group could interact with proteins containing aliphatic or alicyclic residues.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: KCNH2, HRH1, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, HTR2A. These genes encode proteins that could potentially interact directly or indirectly with the described molecular structure.
Summary of Related Gene Names:
- KCNH2
- HRH1
- CYP2D6
- CYP2C9
- HTR2A
These genes are primarily associated with ion channels, neurotransmission, and drug metabolism, which align with the structural characteristics of the given molecule.
