Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1c([O-])c(-c2ccccc2)oc2ccccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that includes a pyrrole ring, an oxetane ring, and an aromatic benzene ring system. The presence of these rings suggests the molecule may interact with proteins involved in cellular signaling pathways and transport mechanisms.
Step 2: The molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), which is known to bind to certain enzymes and receptors. This functional group is particularly relevant for drugs targeting kinases and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The aromatic benzene ring system, combined with the oxetane and pyrrole rings, could potentially interact with proteins such as ABC transporters (e.g., ABCB1) and GPCRs (e.g., ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2). These interactions are often mediated through hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions.
Step 4: Given the presence of a sulfonamide group and the overall structure, this molecule might have affinity for enzymes like CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs, including those targeting the listed genes.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and potential interactions, the molecule is most likely related to genes involved in neurotransmitter signaling and drug metabolism. Specifically, the related gene names include: ABCB1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, LCK, MCL1, and OPRK1. These genes are associated with various aspects of neuronal function, receptor binding, and drug metabolism.
