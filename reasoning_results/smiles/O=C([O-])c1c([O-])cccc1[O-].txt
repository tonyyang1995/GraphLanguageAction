Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])c1c([O-])cccc1[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule has a structure that includes a central carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom (O=C), which is then bonded to another oxygen atom (O) carrying a negative charge ([O-]). This part of the molecule resembles a carboxylic acid group with an additional negatively charged oxygen. The molecule also contains a benzene ring (c1c([O-])cccc1) with two negatively charged oxygens attached to it. These features suggest the molecule may interact with proteins involved in ion transport, neurotransmitter systems, or metabolic pathways.
Step 2: The benzene ring and the negatively charged oxygens indicate that the molecule could potentially interact with receptors or enzymes that have specific binding sites for such structural elements. For example, certain receptors and enzymes can recognize and bind to aromatic rings and charged groups.
Step 3: Considering the molecular structure and its potential interactions, several genes might be relevant. Genes encoding receptors and enzymes that interact with molecules containing aromatic rings and charged groups are likely candidates. Specifically, those involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism are particularly relevant.
Step 4: Receptors and enzymes related to neurotransmission include HTR1A (serotonin receptor), HTR2A (serotonin receptor), HTR2B (serotonin receptor), HTR2C (serotonin receptor), DRD2 (dopamine receptor), DRD3 (dopamine receptor), and DRD4 (dopamine receptor). These receptors might interact with the molecule due to their ability to bind ligands with similar structures.
Step 5: Enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, might also be relevant because they can metabolize drugs and xenobiotics with similar chemical structures to the given molecule.
Summary of related gene names:
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- DRD2
- DRD3
- DRD4
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
These genes encode proteins that might interact with or be influenced by the described molecule through their binding sites or metabolic pathways.
