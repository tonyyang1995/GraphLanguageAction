Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Nc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)c2ccc(N)cc2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)) attached to a benzene ring, which is characteristic of drugs that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature suggests potential interaction with receptors that have such binding sites.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom within the aromatic ring system indicates possible binding to ion channels or transporters. This is particularly relevant for genes encoding ion channels or transport proteins.
Step 3: The overall structure includes a heterocyclic ring system, which can be recognized by enzymes involved in drug metabolism. This suggests potential interactions with genes involved in drug metabolism pathways.
Step 4: The molecule’s structure does not directly align with the known ligand binding sites of the listed receptor genes (e.g., ABL1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, KDR, LCK, OPRK1, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4). However, it could potentially modulate their activity through indirect mechanisms.
Step 5: The most likely related genes are those involved in drug metabolism and transport, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and SLC6A4.
Summary of Related Genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, SLC6A4.
