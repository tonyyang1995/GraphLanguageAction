Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC1=CC(C)(C)N2C(=O)C3(SCC(=O)N3c3ccc(F)cc3)c3cc(C)cc1c32, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is common in many drug molecules and can interact with various receptors and enzymes. This structural feature might be relevant to several genes involved in receptor signaling or drug metabolism.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a quinoline ring, which is known to interact with multiple protein targets including ion channels and receptors. This could potentially relate to genes encoding for ion channels or receptors such as KCNH2 (hERG potassium channel).
Step 3: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH2) suggests potential interactions with proteins that have catalytic or binding sites for amides, which may be relevant to enzymes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: The molecule's overall structure, particularly the presence of aromatic rings and functional groups, might interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are encoded by genes like DRD2, DRD3, and HTR2A.
Step 5: Based on the molecule’s structure and functional groups, it is likely to interact with genes involved in GPCR signaling pathways and drug metabolism, specifically CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.
Summary of Related Genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, HTR2A, KCNH2.
