Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Nc1c[n-]nc1-c1nc2cc(C[NH+]3CCOCC3)ccc2[n-]1)NC1CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring, a nitrile group (-CN), an amide group (-CONH-), and several heteroatoms (nitrogen, oxygen). These structural features suggest the molecule could interact with enzymes or receptors that have similar functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group and nitrogen-containing heterocycles indicates potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). These enzymes are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: The molecule also has a quinoline-like structure, which might indicate potential interactions with proteins involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways, such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4 (dopamine receptors).
Step 4: The presence of an aromatic ring and amide functionalities suggests possible interactions with ion channels or transporters, such as KCNH2 (hERG potassium channel) and SLC6A4 (serotonin transporter).
Step 5: Given the above structural features, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, KCNH2, SLC6A4.
