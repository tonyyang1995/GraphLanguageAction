Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1nn(C(=O)c2ccco2)c(C)c1Sc1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a core structure with multiple rings, including a benzene ring and a thiophene ring, which are typical features of molecules that can interact with various receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH-) suggests potential interactions with ion channels or receptors that have binding sites for such functional groups.
Step 3: The aromatic nature of the molecule indicates it could interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), given their affinity for ligands containing aromatic systems.
Step 4: The molecule's complexity and presence of substituents suggest it may influence signaling pathways involving receptors like DRD2, HTR2A, and HTR2B, which are involved in neurotransmission.
Step 5: Given the potential for interaction with receptors and enzymes, the molecule may be related to genes encoding for these proteins, specifically DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, and potentially CYP2D6.
Summary of related gene names: DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, CYP2D6.
