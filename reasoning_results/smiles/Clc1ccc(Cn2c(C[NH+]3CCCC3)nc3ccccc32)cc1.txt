Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Clc1ccc(Cn2c(C[NH+]3CCCC3)nc3ccccc32)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule containing several functional groups including a chlorinated benzene ring, a pyrrole ring, and multiple aromatic rings connected through various substituents such as methyl and phenyl groups. This structure suggests that the molecule may interact with proteins involved in signal transduction, receptor binding, or enzymatic activity.
Step 2: The presence of a chlorinated benzene ring and multiple aromatic rings indicates potential for interaction with receptors and enzymes that are known to bind to such structures. For example, certain G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) have ligand-binding sites that can accommodate aromatic compounds, and some enzymes like cytochrome P450s can metabolize similar structures.
Step 3: The molecule’s structure also includes a nitrogen atom with an acetyl group, which could suggest interactions with acetylcholine receptors (ChRM1, ChRM3, ChRM4), as these receptors often have binding sites for acetylcholine-like molecules. Additionally, the presence of a quinolone-like structure might indicate potential interactions with dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), as these receptors can be modulated by compounds with similar chemical features.
Step 4: Considering the overall structure and the presence of substituents, the molecule could potentially interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize drugs with similar chemical profiles.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KDR, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, PTGS1, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, and possibly others depending on the exact binding sites and affinities of the molecule. These genes are involved in neurotransmitter systems, signal transduction pathways, and drug metabolism.
