Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Clc1ccc(-c2csc(N3CCC(c4ccccc4)C3)n2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a quinoline-like core structure, which is characterized by a 10-membered aromatic ring with a nitrogen atom and a chlorine substituent. This structural feature is often involved in binding to receptors and enzymes that are associated with neurotransmitter systems and drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a substituted amine group (N3CCC(c4ccccc4)) suggests potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly those involved in the regulation of neurotransmitters such as adrenergic and muscarinic receptors.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a pyrrolidine ring (c2csc(N3CCC(c4ccccc4)n2)), which is known to interact with various receptor types, including dopamine receptors and GPCRs. These interactions could be relevant to the function of genes like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which encode dopamine receptors.
Step 4: The overall structure hints at possible interactions with CYP enzymes due to its complexity and potential for metabolic pathways. This is particularly relevant to genes like CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs.
Step 5: Given the structure's potential to modulate neurotransmitter systems and its possible interactions with CYP enzymes, the related genes include: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. 
Summary of Related Genes: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6.
