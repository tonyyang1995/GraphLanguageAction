Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)N=c1c[n+]([NH+]2CCOCC2)[n-]o1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a core structure of a benzene ring attached to an amide group and a nitrogen atom. This structure is indicative of a potential ligand for receptors that interact with nitrogen-containing molecules.
Step 2: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) and a quaternary ammonium salt (N+), which are both positively charged functional groups, suggests that this molecule could interact with receptors that have negatively charged binding sites, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: Given the molecular structure and the presence of a carboxamide group, this molecule could potentially act as a modulator of ion channels or enzymes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism, which might be relevant to genes encoding for receptors and transporters involved in the central nervous system.
Step 4: The molecule's potential interaction with GPCRs makes it likely to be related to genes that encode for GPCRs, such as DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), HTR1A (Serotonin receptor 1A), and CHRM1 (Cholinergic receptor, muscarinic M1).
Step 5: Considering the possible role in neurotransmission and modulation of signaling pathways, the molecule may also be related to genes involved in signal transduction, such as PTGS1 (Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1), CYP2C9 (Cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 9), and CYP2D6 (Cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily D, polypeptide 6).
Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2
- HTR1A
- CHRM1
- PTGS1
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6 Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring, an amide group, and a nitrogen atom, which suggest it could interact with proteins or receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a nitro group and a quaternary ammonium salt indicates the molecule has charge properties that could influence its interaction with negatively charged binding sites.
Step 3: The carboxamide group suggests the molecule could interact with ion channels or enzymes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism.
Step 4: The potential interactions with GPCRs make the molecule likely to be related to genes like DRD2, HTR1A, and CHRM1.
Step 5: The involvement in neurotransmission and signaling pathways suggests additional related genes include PTGS1, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
- CYP2D6
Note: The remaining genes listed do not have a direct structural or functional relationship with the given molecule based on the provided information. Therefore, they are not included in the summary. However, further research could uncover indirect relationships.
