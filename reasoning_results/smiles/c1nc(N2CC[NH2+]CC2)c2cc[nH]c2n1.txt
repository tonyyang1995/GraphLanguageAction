Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: c1nc(N2CC[NH2+]CC2)c2cc[nH]c2n1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a tricyclic core structure, which is a common feature in many drugs that interact with neurotransmitter receptors and transporters. This suggests potential interactions with genes involved in neurotransmission.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-NH-) and a positively charged nitrogen atom in the molecule indicates it could be a ligand for receptors that have sites for binding basic amino groups or positively charged molecules, such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4).
Step 3: The molecule also includes a quinolone-like structure, which is known to interact with various enzymes and transport proteins. This could indicate potential interactions with genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 4: Given the overall structure, there is a possibility of the molecule interacting with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly those associated with serotonin (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 5: Considering the above structural features, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4.
