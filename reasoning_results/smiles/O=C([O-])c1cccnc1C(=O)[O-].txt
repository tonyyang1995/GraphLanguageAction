Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])c1cccnc1C(=O)[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule is a complex structure containing a ketone group (O=C), an aromatic ring system, and multiple oxygen atoms. It also has negatively charged groups (-O-). This structure suggests potential interactions with receptors or enzymes that have binding sites for similar functional groups.
Step 2: The aromatic ring system, particularly the indole ring (c1cccnc1), indicates a possible interaction with proteins involved in neurotransmission or signal transduction pathways. Such proteins often contain binding sites for small molecules with aromatic or heteroaromatic structures.
Step 3: The presence of a ketone group (O=C) and oxygen atoms (-O-) could indicate potential interactions with enzymes like CYP2D6, which metabolizes drugs with similar functional groups, or receptors like DRD2, which bind to ligands containing hydroxyl or carbonyl groups.
Step 4: The negatively charged groups (-O-) suggest the molecule might interact with cationic transporters or channels. Genes such as SLC6A2 and SLC6A4 encode transporters that are known to interact with negatively charged ligands.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes include: CYP2D6, DRD2, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2D6, DRD2, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
