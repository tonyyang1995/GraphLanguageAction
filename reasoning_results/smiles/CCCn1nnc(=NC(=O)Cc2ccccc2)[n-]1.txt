Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCn1nnc(=NC(=O)Cc2ccccc2)[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule in question has a complex structure featuring a benzene ring, a pyridine ring, and a tricyclic core, which are common features in many drug molecules that interact with receptors and transporters.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the ring system suggests the possibility of amine groups, which can act as ligands for various receptors, including G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are encoded by several of the listed genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, and ADRB2.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a carboxamide group (-CONH-) and an acetyl group (-COCH3), which are functional groups often found in molecules that can modulate the activity of enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are encoded by the CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 genes respectively.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's overall shape and size suggest it could potentially bind to ion channels, which are encoded by genes such as KCNH2 and CACNA1H.
Step 5: Given the structure and functional groups of the molecule, it is likely to interact with a few of the listed genes, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, KCNH2, and CACNA1H.
