Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(CSc1nnnn1-c1ccccc1)N=c1nc(-c2ccc(Cl)cc2)s[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple functional groups such as an amide (N=C), a nitrile (-CN), and aromatic rings. It also includes a heterocyclic ring system with nitrogen atoms, which suggests potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for similar functional groups.
Step 2: Given the presence of a nitrile group (-CN) and aromatic rings, this molecule could interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism. Specifically, it might be metabolized by CYP enzymes, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are known to catalyze reactions involving these functional groups.
Step 3: The presence of a quinolone-like structure (quinoline-like core) in the molecule may suggest interactions with receptors that bind ligands with a similar structure. For example, it could potentially interact with adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) or serotonergic receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Step 4: The molecule's overall structure, including its size and shape, could also influence its interaction with transporters. For instance, it might interact with SLC6A2 and SLC6A4, which are known to transport neurotransmitters and other small molecules across cell membranes.
Step 5: Based on the above structural features and potential interactions, the related genes are likely to include those involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6), adrenergic and serotonergic signaling (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), and neurotransmitter transport (SLC6A2, SLC6A4).
