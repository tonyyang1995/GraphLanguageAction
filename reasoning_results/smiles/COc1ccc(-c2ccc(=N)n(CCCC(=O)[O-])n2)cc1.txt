Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(-c2ccc(=N)n(CCCC(=O)[O-])n2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex molecule that includes a core structure with several functional groups such as a pyrrole ring, a pyridine ring, and a quinoline-like structure. These structural features suggest the molecule may interact with proteins involved in signal transduction, neurotransmission, and metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a quinoline-like structure and a pyridine ring is particularly noteworthy because these are common motifs in ligands for receptors and enzymes. Specifically, the pyridine ring could potentially interact with aromatic amino acid residues in receptor binding sites, while the quinoline-like structure might bind to specific enzyme active sites.
Step 3: Given the molecular structure, it is plausible that this molecule could interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are known to have a characteristic seven-transmembrane domain structure that can be targeted by molecules with similar aromatic and heterocyclic moieties. This suggests potential interactions with genes encoding for GPCRs such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure might also interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes, given the presence of functional groups like amides and possibly a carboxylate group. This interaction would be relevant to genes such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule appears to be related to several genes, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These genes encode for proteins that are involved in neurotransmission, signal transduction, and drug metabolism.
