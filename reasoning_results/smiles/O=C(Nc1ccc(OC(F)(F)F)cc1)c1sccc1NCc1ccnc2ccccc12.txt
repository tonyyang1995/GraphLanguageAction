Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Nc1ccc(OC(F)(F)F)cc1)c1sccc1NCc1ccnc2ccccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure including an aromatic ring system, a carbonyl group, and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle. These structural features suggest potential interactions with enzymes or receptors that contain similar functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of fluorine atoms (-F) attached to the aromatic ring indicates possible pharmacological activity through halogen bonding or other interactions involving these functional groups. This could be relevant for genes involved in drug metabolism or receptor binding.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a sulfide (S) linkage which might interact with proteins containing cysteine residues, particularly in enzymes or receptors. This could be significant for genes encoding such proteins.
Step 4: Given the diverse functional groups and potential for interactions with various biological targets, the molecule may have multiple points of interaction with different genes. However, it is likely to have a stronger affinity for genes involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmission, and hormone signaling due to its structural complexity.
Step 5: Based on the molecular features described, the most likely related genes are those involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), neurotransmission (DRD2, DRD3, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), and hormone signaling (ESR1).
