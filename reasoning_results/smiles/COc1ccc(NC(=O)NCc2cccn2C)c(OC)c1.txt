Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(NC(=O)NCc2cccn2C)c(OC)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a benzene ring system with a nitrogen atom (N) attached to it, indicating the presence of an amide group (-CONH-). This structural feature suggests that the molecule may interact with enzymes or receptors that are involved in the metabolism or signaling pathways related to this functional group.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a pyrrole ring system, which is often associated with drug molecules due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds and its role in stabilizing transition states during enzymatic reactions. This structural element points towards potential interactions with enzymes such as those involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule has a pyridine ring with a carboxamide group (-CONH-), which can be recognized by certain protein targets like G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or enzymes that recognize this functional group for catalytic purposes. This could indicate a relationship with genes encoding receptors or enzymes that bind to or metabolize molecules containing these functional groups.
Step 4: Given the presence of an amide group and a carboxamide group, the molecule might have affinity for enzymes involved in the metabolism of drugs or neurotransmitters, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize various substrates including amides and carboxamides.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and potential interactions, the most likely related genes are those involved in drug metabolism and signaling pathways, specifically CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. These genes encode enzymes that play crucial roles in the biotransformation of xenobiotics and endogenous substances, making them relevant to the function of the described molecule.
