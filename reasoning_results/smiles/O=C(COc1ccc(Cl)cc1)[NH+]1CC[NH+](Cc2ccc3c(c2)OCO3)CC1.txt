Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(COc1ccc(Cl)cc1)[NH+]1CC[NH+](Cc2ccc3c(c2)OCO3)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring, which is characteristic of several neurotransmitter receptors and enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a quinoline ring and amide groups suggests potential interactions with enzymes like CYP2D6, which metabolizes drugs containing these functional groups.
Step 3: The aromatic ring system and substituents (like chlorine) indicate possible binding to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are known for their diverse ligand-binding properties.
Step 4: The presence of an acetyl group and a benzene ring could suggest activity against enzymes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 5: The overall structure, including the amide and aromatic parts, may interact with receptors and enzymes related to neurotransmission and signal transduction, such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C.
