Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=[N+]([O-])c1cccc2c(Br)[n-]nc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other type of content.
Step 1: The molecule contains an N-nitroso moiety (-[N+]([O-])) which is known to interact with certain enzymes involved in drug metabolism. This suggests a potential interaction with genes encoding enzymes that metabolize such compounds.
Step 2: The molecule also has a benzene ring with a bromine substituent (Br), which could indicate involvement with genes associated with transport proteins that handle aromatic compounds or those involved in xenobiotic metabolism.
Step 3: The presence of a nitrogen atom with positive charge and a negatively charged oxygen atom suggests basic and acidic functionalities, respectively, which may interact with receptors or transporters. This points towards potential interactions with genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or ion channels.
Step 4: The overall structure includes aromatic rings and heteroatoms, which are common in molecules that can act as ligands for various receptors and enzymes. This structure might be relevant to genes encoding neurotransmitter receptors and enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 5: Given the above structural features, the molecule is likely to be related to genes such as CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and SLC6A4, which are involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmitter transport and signaling.
