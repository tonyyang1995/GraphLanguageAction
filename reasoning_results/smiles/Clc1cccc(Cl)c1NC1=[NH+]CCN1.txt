Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Clc1cccc(Cl)c1NC1=[NH+]CCN1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is a common feature in many drugs that interact with receptors and transport proteins. This structural pattern suggests potential interactions with genes encoding for receptors or transporters.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a quinoline ring, which is known to be involved in binding to various protein targets, including enzymes and receptors. This feature may indicate a relationship with genes encoding enzymes or receptors that have quinoline-binding sites.
Step 3: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule, specifically in the amide group (-CONH-), could suggest interactions with genes encoding proteins that contain similar functional groups, such as enzymes involved in metabolic pathways.
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule, including its size and functional groups, might allow it to bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or other membrane-bound proteins, potentially relating to genes like HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and DRD2.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is most likely related to the genes encoding GPCRs and enzymes, particularly those involved in neurotransmitter signaling and drug metabolism. The related gene names are: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. 
Summary of related gene names: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
