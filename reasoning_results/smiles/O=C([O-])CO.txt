Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])CO, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has the SMILES string O=C([O-])CO, which represents a carboxylic acid derivative with an additional negatively charged oxygen atom. This structure suggests that the molecule could be a type of drug or inhibitor targeting enzymes or receptors involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: Considering the structure, the molecule might interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to its potential to bind to the receptor's ligand-binding domain. GPCRs are often involved in various physiological processes and are targeted by many drugs. Some of the listed genes encode for GPCRs such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and HRH1.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule's acidic nature might allow it to interact with ion channels or transporters. For instance, CACNA1H encodes for a voltage-gated calcium channel, and SLC6A2 and SLC6A4 encode for neurotransmitter transporters. Therefore, the molecule could potentially influence these proteins' functions.
Step 4: Furthermore, the molecule's structure may enable it to modulate enzymes involved in drug metabolism. CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 are all cytochrome P450 enzymes that play crucial roles in metabolizing various drugs. Interactions with these enzymes could affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the molecule.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and potential interactions, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, CACNA1H, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These genes encode proteins that could directly or indirectly interact with the given molecule. Summary: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, CACNA1H, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6.
