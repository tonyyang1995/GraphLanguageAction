Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCC[NH2+]C(=O)[N-]S(=O)(=O)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (NH2+), which suggests it could be an amine or a similar functional group. This type of functional group often interacts with proteins that have binding sites for basic or charged amino acid residues.
Step 2: The molecule also has a sulfonate ester group (S(=O)(=O)) and a carboxylic acid group (C(=O)), indicating potential for interactions with enzymes or receptors that bind to acidic or polar functional groups.
Step 3: The presence of a benzene ring (indicated by the double bond in "C[NH2+]C") suggests that the molecule may interact with aromatic amino acids in proteins, which are common in many receptors and transporters.
Step 4: Given the structure of the molecule, it could potentially interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to its size and functional groups, which are known to bind to such receptors. GPCRs are involved in signal transduction pathways and are associated with multiple genes listed here, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, and PTGS1.
Step 5: The molecule might also interact with enzymes like CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are involved in drug metabolism and are present in the list provided.
