Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1oncc1C(=O)Nc1ccc(C(F)(F)F)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings and functional groups, including a pyrrole ring, an amide group (-CONH-), and fluorine substituents. This type of structure is often found in drugs that interact with receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of the amide group suggests that this molecule could potentially act as a ligand for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are known to have amide binding sites. GPCRs are involved in signal transduction pathways and are associated with various physiological processes, including neurotransmission and hormone action.
Step 3: Given the pattern of substituents, particularly the fluorine atoms, it is possible that this molecule might be designed to interact specifically with certain GPCRs, such as those involved in adrenergic and cholinergic signaling. Adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and cholinergic receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4) are key players in these signaling pathways.
Step 4: The presence of the amide and the overall structure suggest potential interactions with enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are important in drug metabolism. These enzymes are responsible for the biotransformation of many drugs, affecting their efficacy and toxicity.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule is likely related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. These genes encode proteins involved in receptor and enzyme functions relevant to the molecule's structure and potential pharmacological activity.
