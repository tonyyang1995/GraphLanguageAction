Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCC1CC[NH+](CCCN2C(=O)COc3cc(F)ccc32)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that includes several functional groups such as amine (NH2), carboxyl (COOH), and aromatic rings (indicated by the presence of benzene rings). The presence of an amine group (-NH+) suggests the molecule could act as a ligand for receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: Notably, the molecule contains a benzodiazepine-like structure (indicated by the presence of a nitrogen atom bonded to two carbon atoms and a carboxylic acid group). This structural feature is characteristic of molecules that interact with GABAA receptors, which are known to be regulated by various genes such as GABRA1, GABRB1, and GABRG1.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule has a quinoline-like structure, which might indicate potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP enzymes (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Step 4: The presence of a carboxylic acid group and a benzene ring also suggests possible interactions with ion channels, particularly those involved in cardiac function, such as KCNH2.
Step 5: Considering the identified structural features, the most likely related genes from the provided list are those involved in receptor function (specifically GABAA receptors), enzyme metabolism (CYP family), and ion channel activity (KCNH2). Therefore, the related gene names include:
- GABRA1
- GABRB1
- GABRG1
- CYP1A2
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- KCNH2
These genes are relevant due to their roles in processes that the described molecular structure might influence. However, it's important to note that without experimental validation, this is a hypothesis based on the molecule's structure. Step 5: Summary of Related Gene Names:
This list reflects the genes most likely to be involved based on the molecule's structural features. Further research would be needed to confirm these relationships.
