Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: c1ccc(-c2nc(N3CCCCCC3)nc(-n3ccnc3)n2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this might be important.
Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound with multiple aromatic rings and heteroatoms such as nitrogen and oxygen. It contains a benzene ring and a pyrrole ring fused together, forming a structure known as indole. The presence of multiple nitrogen atoms suggests potential for forming hydrogen bonds, which are crucial for interactions with proteins and nucleic acids.
Step 2: The molecule's size and shape, particularly the presence of multiple functional groups like amine and carboxyl groups, indicate it could interact with receptors and enzymes. The amine group could potentially bind to ion channels or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), while the carboxyl group could interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: Considering the gene features, the molecule's structure aligns well with the characteristics of GPCRs, which often have binding sites for small molecules containing amine and carboxyl groups. Specific genes related to GPCRs include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
Step 4: The molecule's potential to interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, is also notable. These enzymes play a critical role in metabolizing drugs and other xenobiotics, making them relevant targets for small molecules.
Step 5: The molecule's structure also suggests possible interactions with kinases, given the presence of hydroxyl and amino groups that could participate in phosphorylation reactions. Genes encoding kinases, such as LCK and CDK2, may be relevant.
