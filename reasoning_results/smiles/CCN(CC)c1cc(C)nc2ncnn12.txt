Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCN(CC)c1cc(C)nc2ncnn12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a tricyclic compound containing a pyrrolidine ring fused to an imidazole ring and a benzene ring. This structure is indicative of a class of molecules known as imidazopyridines, which are often used as inhibitors of various enzymes and receptors.
Step 2: The presence of multiple nitrogen atoms, particularly in the imidazole and pyrrolidine rings, suggests that the molecule could potentially interact with proteins that have nitrogen binding sites, such as enzymes or receptors. The nitrogen atoms could form hydrogen bonds or other interactions with amino acid residues in protein active sites.
Step 3: The molecule's structure includes a benzene ring, which is a common feature in many drug molecules due to its aromatic properties and ability to participate in various types of intermolecular interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking). This could suggest that the molecule might interact with proteins that contain aromatic amino acids in their active sites.
Step 4: Given the molecule's structure and the genes listed, it is most likely to interact with genes encoding enzymes involved in metabolism or signaling pathways, such as those listed under CYP (Cytochrome P450) and HTR (HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), as well as G-protein coupled receptors like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4. The aromatic and nitrogen-containing structure suggests potential interactions with these genes' encoded proteins.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and the described interactions, the related genes are: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
