Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [NH3+]Cc1ccc(C(=O)[O-])cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (+) and is bonded to three hydrogen atoms, indicating it is an amine compound with a quaternary ammonium group. This structure is common in ligands that can interact with receptors such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 2: The molecule also includes a phenyl ring system attached to a carbonyl group (-CO-) and a negatively charged oxygen atom (-O-). This suggests the molecule could act as a potential ligand for enzymes or receptors involved in signaling pathways.
Step 3: The presence of a phenyl ring and a carbonyl group is characteristic of molecules that can interact with proteins involved in signal transduction, such as kinases and GPCRs. This structural feature is relevant to genes encoding for proteins involved in these pathways.
Step 4: Specific genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, and ADRB2 encode for adrenergic receptors, which are GPCRs. The molecule's structure may allow it to bind to these receptors, potentially modulating their activity.
Step 5: Other genes such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 encode for serotonin receptors, another type of GPCR. The molecule's structure might enable it to interact with these receptors, affecting serotonin signaling.
