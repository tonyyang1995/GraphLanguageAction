Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC1(C)CCC(C)(C)c2cc(C(=O)Nc3ccc(C(=O)[O-])cc3)ccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule, which appears to be a derivative of a benzodiazepine-like structure. This structure includes aromatic rings, heteroatoms (such as nitrogen and oxygen), and a carboxyl group (-COOH). The presence of a benzodiazepine-like core suggests potential interactions with receptors that bind benzodiazepines or similar molecules.
Step 2: The molecule contains a carboxyl group and an amide group, which are characteristic functional groups for compounds that interact with ion channels, receptors, and transporters. Benzodiazepine derivatives often modulate neurotransmitter systems, particularly those involving GABA receptors, which are linked to genes such as GABRA1, GABRB1, and GABRG1. However, the specific gene targets cannot be directly inferred from the provided list without further analysis.
Step 3: Given the presence of a carboxylic acid group and amide functionality, the molecule might also interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). These enzymes play a crucial role in metabolizing drugs, including benzodiazepine derivatives.
Step 4: The molecule’s structure could potentially affect the function of ion channels, given the presence of aromatic rings and possibly other hydrophobic regions. Ion channels are associated with genes like KCNH2 (potassium channel, voltage-gated, subfamily H, member 2), which might be influenced by this molecule.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and potential interactions, the molecule is likely to have effects on neurotransmitter systems, particularly those involving GABAergic pathways, and may interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism. Based on the provided gene list, the most relevant genes include CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and possibly KCNH2.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP1A2
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- KCNH2
Note: The provided list does not include all possible genes that the molecule might interact with, but these are the most directly relevant based on the molecular structure described. For a comprehensive analysis, additional testing and research would be necessary.
