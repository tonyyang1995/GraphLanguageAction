Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc(=NC(=O)c2cccc(F)c2)[n-]o1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an amide group (-CONH2), which are potential sites for interaction with certain receptors and enzymes. This structural pattern suggests the molecule could interact with genes involved in receptor function or metabolic pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a fluorine atom (-F) in the molecule indicates it may have specific interactions with proteins that recognize or bind to fluorine, possibly affecting genes related to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The amide group could potentially interact with enzymes like CYP2D6, which metabolizes many drugs including those containing amide groups, suggesting a possible relationship with this gene.
Step 4: The overall structure includes features that might interact with neurotransmitter receptors, such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and DRD2, given its potential to bind to and modulate receptor activity.
Step 5: Based on the molecule’s structural features, the related genes include: CYP2D6, HTR2A, HTR2B, and DRD2. 
Summary of Related Genes: CYP2D6, HTR2A, HTR2B, DRD2.
