Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CN(C)c1ccc(CN=c2[n-]cc(Br)cc2Br)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with multiple functional groups including a pyridine ring, amide bonds, and aromatic rings. Notably, it contains a nitrogen atom in the central position that is part of an amide group and is also involved in a heterocyclic ring (pyrrole-like). This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for similar chemical motifs.
Step 2: Among the listed genes, those primarily involved in neurotransmitter transport and signaling are most likely to interact with such a molecule due to their functional groups and binding sites. These include HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode for various subtypes of serotonin receptors. Additionally, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which encode dopamine receptors, could be relevant given the presence of nitrogen atoms and amide groups, which are common in ligands for these receptors.
Step 3: Another set of genes related to this molecule includes those involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways, such as HRH1 (histamine H1 receptor), which could interact with the aromatic and nitrogen-containing parts of the molecule. Similarly, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4 (cholinergic receptors) might also bind to this molecule due to their affinity for similar structural motifs.
Step 4: The CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) are also relevant because they metabolize many drugs and xenobiotics, and their activity could be influenced by the presence of specific functional groups in the molecule. However, without more detailed information about the exact functional groups, it's less certain how directly the molecule would interact with these enzymes compared to the receptors mentioned above.
Step 5: Summary of related genes: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HRH1, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4. 
These genes encode proteins that are involved in neurotransmitter signaling and could potentially interact with the described molecular structure based on the presence of nitrogen atoms, amide bonds, and aromatic rings. The interaction would depend on the specific functional groups present in the molecule, but these genes represent the most plausible candidates for direct interaction. Other genes like CYP enzymes may influence the metabolism of the molecule but are not as directly related to its primary function in terms of binding and signaling. 
List of related genes:

The remaining genes do not have a clear structural or functional relationship with the described molecule based on the provided information. They are involved in diverse biological processes such as cell cycle regulation, hormone signaling, and drug metabolism, but their relevance to the molecule is less direct.
