Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc2c(c1)c(CC(=O)[NH+]1CCOCC1)c(C)n2C(=O)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule, which appears to be a derivative of an amide and includes multiple functional groups such as carboxylic acids, amides, and aromatic rings. This structure suggests that the molecule could interact with proteins involved in signaling pathways, transport mechanisms, and enzymatic activities.
Step 2: Analyzing the molecule's structure, it contains a central core with several substituents, including a carboxamide group, which is often found in ligands for receptors and enzymes. The presence of this functional group indicates potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other membrane-bound proteins.
Step 3: Given the presence of a carboxamide and aromatic rings, this molecule might interact with enzymes like CYP2D6, which metabolizes many drugs and endogenous substances through oxidative reactions involving aromatic rings and amide bonds.
Step 4: The molecule also has a structure that could potentially bind to transporters or receptors that are involved in neurotransmitter reuptake or release, such as SLC6A2 (noradrenaline transporter) and SLC6A4 (serotonin transporter), based on its amide and aromatic functionalities.
Step 5: Considering the above points, the molecule may have a relationship with the following genes: CYP2D6, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4. These genes encode proteins that could interact directly or indirectly with the molecule due to their functional roles in metabolism and neurotransmitter regulation.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2D6
- SLC6A2
- SLC6A4
The molecule likely interacts with these genes due to its chemical structure, which includes functional groups that can engage in binding interactions with proteins encoded by these genes. However, the exact nature of these interactions would require further experimental validation.
