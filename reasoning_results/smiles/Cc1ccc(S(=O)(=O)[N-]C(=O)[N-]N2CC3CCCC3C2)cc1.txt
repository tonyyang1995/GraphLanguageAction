Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)[N-]C(=O)[N-]N2CC3CCCC3C2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this might be important.
Step 1: The molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-S(=O)(=O)N-) which is often found in drugs that interact with various receptors and ion channels. This structural feature suggests potential interactions with genes encoding for receptors and ion channels.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group (-C(=O)N-) indicates the molecule could act as an antagonist or agonist for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are encoded by genes like DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These receptors are known to bind small molecules and modulate their activity.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a benzene ring system, which is common in many ligands for nuclear receptors such as PPARγ (encoded by PPARG). This suggests possible interaction with genes involved in lipid metabolism and cellular signaling.
Step 4: Given the presence of multiple aromatic rings and nitrogen-containing heterocycles, the molecule may also interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. These enzymes are responsible for metabolizing many drugs, including this one.
Step 5: The overall structure of the molecule, with its combination of aromatic rings, heterocycles, and functional groups, points towards potential interactions with genes encoding for ion channels and receptors, particularly those involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways.
