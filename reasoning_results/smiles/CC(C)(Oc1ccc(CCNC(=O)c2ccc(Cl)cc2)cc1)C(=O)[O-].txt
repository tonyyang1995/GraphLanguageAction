Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)(Oc1ccc(CCNC(=O)c2ccc(Cl)cc2)cc1)C(=O)[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring with various substituents, including an amide group (N-C=O), a carboxylate group (O-C=O), and a chloride atom. These structural features suggest that the molecule may interact with proteins involved in signal transduction, neurotransmission, and drug metabolism.
Step 2: Among the provided genes, several are known to be involved in neurotransmitter systems and signal transduction pathways, which could potentially interact with this molecule. For instance, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 encode serotonin receptors, which are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that can bind to various ligands, including small molecules like the one described. Additionally, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4 encode dopamine receptors, which are also GPCRs and could interact with the molecule due to its chemical structure.
Step 3: The molecule also has potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. These cytochrome P450 enzymes play crucial roles in metabolizing many drugs and xenobiotics, and their activity can be influenced by structurally similar compounds. The presence of an amide and carboxylate group in the molecule suggests it might act as a substrate for these enzymes or inhibit their function.
Step 4: Furthermore, the molecule's structure indicates it could interact with ion channels, particularly those encoded by genes like KCNH2, which encodes the hERG potassium channel. Ion channels are essential for neuronal signaling, and molecules that modulate their activity can have significant physiological effects.
Step 5: Based on the analysis of the molecule's structure and the functions of the provided genes, the related gene names are: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and KCNH2. These genes are involved in neurotransmission, signal transduction, and drug metabolism, making them potential targets for the described molecule.
