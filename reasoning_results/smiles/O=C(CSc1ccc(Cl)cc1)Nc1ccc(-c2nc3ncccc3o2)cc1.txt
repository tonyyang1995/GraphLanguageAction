Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(CSc1ccc(Cl)cc1)Nc1ccc(-c2nc3ncccc3o2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex molecule that includes an aromatic ring system, a cyano group (-CN), and a nitro group (-NO2). These structural features are often involved in interactions with proteins that have roles in drug metabolism and signaling pathways.
Step 2: Notably, the molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), which is known to be metabolized by CYP enzymes, particularly CYP2E1, though it's not directly listed among the provided genes. However, this feature might suggest potential interaction with other CYP enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are all listed in the provided gene list.
Step 3: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) suggests possible binding to certain receptors or enzymes, including those involved in neurotransmission. Among the provided genes, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are known to be involved in the metabolism of drugs that contain similar functional groups.
Step 4: Given the aromatic nature of the molecule, it could potentially interact with receptors or enzymes that bind to aromatic compounds. Genes such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C (which code for serotonin receptors) and DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4 (which code for dopamine receptors) are involved in neurotransmission and could be relevant targets.
Step 5: The overall structure and functional groups of the molecule indicate potential interactions with multiple systems in the body, but the closest related genes from the provided list are those involved in neurotransmission and metabolism, specifically: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
