Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(C[NH2+]CC2(F)CC[NH+](C(=O)c3ccc(F)c(Cl)c3)CC2)nc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule contains several functional groups such as amine (-NH2), carboxyl (-COOH), and fluorine (F) substituents, indicating it could be an organic compound with potential pharmacological activity.
Step 2: Considering the presence of amine groups and carboxyl groups, this molecule likely interacts with proteins that have binding sites for such functional groups, such as enzymes or receptors. For instance, it might interact with receptors that contain amine-binding sites or enzymes that have carboxylate-binding sites.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a benzene ring system and heteroatoms like nitrogen and fluorine, which are common in ligands that bind to receptors and enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways. This suggests possible interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or other receptors involved in neurotransmission and signaling.
Step 4: Given the structural features, the molecule may have affinity for receptors or enzymes associated with neurotransmitters and their modulation. Notably, receptors such as DRD2 (Dopamine D2 receptor), HTR1A (Serotonin 5-HT1A receptor), HTR2A (Serotonin 5-HT2A receptor), and HTR2B (Serotonin 5-HT2B receptor) are known to have binding sites for compounds with similar functional groups and structures.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions with receptors and enzymes, the related genes include: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B.
Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B Step 5: Summary of related gene names:
- HTR2B
These genes are associated with neurotransmitter receptors that could potentially interact with the given molecule due to its structural features. Specifically, DRD2 and HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR1A are involved in dopamine and serotonin signaling pathways, respectively. The presence of amine and carboxyl groups in the molecule suggests it could bind to these receptors and modulate their function.
