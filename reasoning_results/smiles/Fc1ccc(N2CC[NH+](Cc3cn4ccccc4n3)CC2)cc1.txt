Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Fc1ccc(N2CC[NH+](Cc3cn4ccccc4n3)CC2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure including a fused ring system with a nitrogen atom, a benzene ring, and various substituents such as fluoro (Fc), amino (N), and cyano (CN). The presence of a nitrogen atom suggests potential for hydrogen bonding or basicity, which could interact with proteins that have acidic residues.
Step 2: Notably, the molecule contains a pyrrole ring and a pyridine ring, which are common motifs in drugs that bind to ion channels, receptors, and transporters. These rings are likely to interact with proteins involved in neurotransmission or ion regulation.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a quinoline-like structure, which is often found in drugs targeting enzymes like CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 due to its ability to form stable interactions with these enzymes' active sites through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic effects.
Step 4: Given the presence of these functional groups and structural features, the molecule may interact with genes encoding for enzymes and transporters such as CYP2D6, CYP3A4, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, and possibly ABCB1, which encodes the P-glycoprotein efflux pump.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule might interact with genes involved in neurotransmission pathways, such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and DRD2, given the potential for binding to serotonergic and dopaminergic receptors due to its aromatic and heterocyclic nature.
