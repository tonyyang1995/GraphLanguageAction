Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=S1(=O)CC[NH+](CCc2cn(Cc3ccc(C(F)(F)F)cc3)c3ccccc23)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this relationship might be important.
Step 1: The molecule contains a sulfonamide group (O=S), which is characteristic of many drugs that interact with enzymes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism or receptor function. This structural feature suggests potential interaction with genes encoding proteins involved in neurotransmission or drug metabolism.
Step 2: The molecule also has a benzene ring (CC) connected to a nitrogen atom (N) with a positive charge ([NH+]), indicating it may be a positively charged amine. This type of functional group is often found in molecules that interact with receptors such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The presence of multiple aromatic rings and heteroatoms (such as fluorine atoms F) in the molecule suggests it could be a potent ligand for various receptors or ion channels, given these features are common in ligands that bind to these targets.
Step 4: Given the pattern of aromatic rings and the positive charge, the molecule is likely to interact with genes encoding for GPCRs, ion channels, and enzymes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism, such as those listed under neurotransmitter receptors and transporters.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the following genes are potentially related to the molecule: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, and SLC6A2.
