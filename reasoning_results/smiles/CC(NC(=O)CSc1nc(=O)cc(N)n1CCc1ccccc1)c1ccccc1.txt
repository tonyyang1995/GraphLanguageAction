Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(NC(=O)CSc1nc(=O)cc(N)n1CCc1ccccc1)c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings and functional groups such as amide (N-C=O), phenyl rings, and heterocycles like pyrrolidine and indole. This complexity suggests the molecule could interact with proteins that have similar structural motifs or functional domains.
Step 2: Among the listed genes, several are involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways, which often interact with small molecules through their ligand-binding sites. Notable here are genes encoding for various adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), and serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6). These receptors typically bind to small molecules and modulate cellular responses based on the binding affinity.
Step 3: The presence of an amide group in the molecule could indicate its potential as a ligand for enzymes that require a similar functional group for binding, such as the CYP (cytochrome P450) family of enzymes. Genes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 are all part of this family and are known to metabolize drugs and other xenobiotics.
Step 4: Considering the overall structure and the presence of specific functional groups, the molecule might also be relevant to genes involved in ion channel regulation and neurotransmitter transport, such as KCNH2 (a potassium channel subunit) and SLC6A4 (serotonin transporter). These proteins are crucial for maintaining homeostasis and signal transduction in neurons.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis and the functional implications of the molecule, the genes potentially related to this molecule include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, KCNH2, and SLC6A4. These genes encode proteins that either directly interact with small molecules or play roles in the metabolism and transport of these molecules within the cell.
