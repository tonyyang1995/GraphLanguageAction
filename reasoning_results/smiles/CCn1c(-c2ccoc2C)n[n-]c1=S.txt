Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCn1c(-c2ccoc2C)n[n-]c1=S, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compound, specifically an indole-based amide, which includes a benzene ring, a pyrrole ring, and a sulfone group. This structure suggests potential interactions with receptors or enzymes that are involved in neurotransmission or metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a sulfone group in the molecule could indicate a possible interaction with sulfotransferases (SULTs), such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are known to be involved in the metabolism of various drugs and xenobiotics. This relationship is due to the sulfone moiety being a common target for these enzymes.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a quaternary ammonium group (-[n-]), which might interact with ion channels, particularly those belonging to the CACNA1H family, which encodes calcium channels. This interaction could be significant if the molecule acts as a modulator of calcium channel activity.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a naphthyl group and the overall structure suggest that the molecule may have affinity for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as DRD2, HTR1A, and HTR2A, which are involved in neurotransmitter signaling pathways. These receptors are known to bind various ligands, including neurotransmitters and drugs.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the most likely related genes are CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CACNA1H, DRD2, HTR1A, and HTR2A. These genes encode proteins that are directly involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmission, respectively. The molecule's structure indicates potential interactions with these genes' encoded proteins.
