Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+]1CCC(OC(c2ccccc2)c2ccccc2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains an amine group (-NH+) which is a common functional group in many small molecules that interact with receptors and enzymes. This suggests potential interaction with genes encoding for receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The molecule has multiple aromatic rings and a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH), indicating it could be a substrate for enzymes involved in phase I metabolism, such as cytochrome P450s (CYP). Genes like CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are involved in this process.
Step 3: The presence of a benzene ring and alkyl chains might indicate the molecule could bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), given that these receptors often interact with lipophilic ligands. Genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, and ADRB2 encode for GPCRs.
Step 4: The molecule’s structure does not directly suggest a strong binding affinity for kinases, based on its current pattern. However, some kinases may still be indirectly influenced due to metabolic pathways involving the molecule.
Step 5: Given the molecule’s complex structure, it could potentially influence signaling pathways through various mechanisms, including but not limited to receptor activation or inhibition. Genes like DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, and PTGS1 are involved in neurotransmission and inflammation, respectively.
Summary of Related Genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, PTGS1.
