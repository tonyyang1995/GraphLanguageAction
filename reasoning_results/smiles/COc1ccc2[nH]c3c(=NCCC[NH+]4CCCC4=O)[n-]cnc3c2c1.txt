Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc2[nH]c3c(=NCCC[NH+]4CCCC4=O)[n-]cnc3c2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a quinoline-like structure with a nitrogen atom bearing a positive charge (N+), which is part of an imidazole ring. This structure is common in ligands that interact with ion channels and receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a pyrrole ring fused to the quinoline core suggests potential interaction with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, given the commonality of this structural motif in CYP substrates.
Step 3: The aromatic amine group and the carboxylic acid moiety indicate potential binding to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly those associated with neurotransmitter systems, like adrenergic (ADRA1D, ADRA2B) and dopaminergic (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) receptors.
Step 4: The presence of a nitrile group (-CN) and a carboxamide group (-CONH2) might suggest activity against certain kinases, such as LCK (Lck protein tyrosine kinase).
Step 5: Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, the molecule could potentially interact with multiple targets, including but not limited to CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A). However, the primary focus appears to be on interactions with adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors due to the structural features mentioned.
