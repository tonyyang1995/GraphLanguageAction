Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(CSc1nc2ccccc2s1)N=c1[n-]ccs1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this relationship might be important.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrile (CN) group and a cyano (C#N) group, which are characteristic functional groups that can interact with proteins such as enzymes or receptors. These functional groups are often involved in binding to drug targets like enzymes or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring with substituents (e.g., alkyl chains, heteroatoms) suggests potential interactions with aromatic amino acid residues in protein binding sites, which could include enzymes or receptors. Benzene rings are common in ligands that bind to these types of proteins.
Step 3: The molecule has a quinone-like structure (O=C(CS)), which is known to interact with certain enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP (cytochrome P450) genes. This structure could potentially modulate the activity of enzymes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4.
Step 4: Given the overall complexity and potential for interaction with multiple biological pathways, the molecule may also have effects on neurotransmitter systems, which are regulated by genes like HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, among others.
Step 5: The molecule’s structure includes sulfur atoms and possibly nitrogen atoms, which could form hydrogen bonds or other interactions with amino acid side chains in proteins. This structural feature could lead to interactions with ion channels, such as those encoded by KCNH2, or receptors like GPCRs.
