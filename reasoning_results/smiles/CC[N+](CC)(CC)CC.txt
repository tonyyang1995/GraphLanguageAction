Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC[N+](CC)(CC)CC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string CC[N+](CC)(CC)CC is a positively charged nitrogen-containing compound, which suggests it may interact with receptors that have binding sites for basic or positively charged molecules.
Step 2: The pattern of the molecule includes multiple benzene rings (represented by 'C' in the SMILES string), indicating it could be a potential ligand for receptors involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways, such as those found in the adrenergic and cholinergic systems.
Step 3: Given the presence of the positively charged nitrogen atom, this molecule might also interact with ion channels or transporters, particularly those involved in sodium or calcium currents, which are often modulated by positively charged compounds.
Step 4: Considering the structure and charge of the molecule, it is plausible that it could interact with receptors such as DRD2 (Dopamine D2 receptor), HTR2A (Serotonin 5-HT2A receptor), and CHRM1 (Cholinergic receptor, muscarinic M1), all of which are involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways.
Step 5: The related gene names based on the described interaction are: DRD2, HTR2A, and CHRM1.
Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2
- HTR2A
- CHRM1
These genes encode receptors that are likely to interact with the described molecule due to its structural and charge characteristics. Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string CC[N+](CC)(CC)CC is a positively charged nitrogen-containing compound, which suggests it may interact with receptors that have binding sites for basic or positively charged molecules.
Step 2: The molecule contains multiple benzene rings, which are common in many drug-like molecules and can form stable interactions with protein binding sites through π-π stacking and hydrophobic effects.
Step 3: The positively charged nitrogen atom in the molecule indicates it could interact with anionic sites on proteins, potentially affecting the function of certain receptors.
Step 4: Given the structure, the molecule is likely to interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels, which are known to bind to positively charged ligands and modulate their activity.
Step 5: Based on the above considerations, the molecule is most likely to be related to the following genes: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, as they encode receptors that are involved in neurotransmission and may be affected by positively charged ligands and benzene ring-containing structures.
