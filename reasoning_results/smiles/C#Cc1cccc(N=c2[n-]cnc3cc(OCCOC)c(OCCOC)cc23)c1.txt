Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C#Cc1cccc(N=c2[n-]cnc3cc(OCCOC)c(OCCOC)cc23)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that includes aromatic rings, a cyano group (-CN), amide bonds, and multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH). This structural complexity suggests potential interactions with enzymes or receptors involved in metabolism or signaling pathways.
Step 2: Analyzing the genes listed, those involved in metabolism and drug processing (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) are likely to interact directly with the molecule due to its potential to be metabolized by these enzymes. Additionally, genes encoding for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and HRH1 could also have significant interactions because of the presence of hydroxyl and amide functionalities that might activate or inhibit these receptors.
Step 3: The presence of a cyano group and amide bonds indicates the molecule could potentially act as an inhibitor or activator of certain enzymes, particularly those involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction, which are often targeted by drugs.
Step 4: The molecule's structure also hints at possible interactions with enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of neurotransmitters or other signaling molecules, such as PTGS1 (which encodes cyclooxygenase-1, involved in prostaglandin synthesis).
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis and potential functional roles, the genes most likely to be related to this molecule are those involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and those encoding GPCRs (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1).
