Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1c(C(=O)[N-]N2CCCCC2)nn(-c2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl)c1-c1ccc(Cl)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups including a carboxylate group (-COOH), a nitrile group (-CN), and various aromatic rings. The presence of these groups suggests that the molecule could potentially interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism and transport.
Step 2: The aromatic rings in the molecule, particularly those containing halogens (Cl), indicate potential interactions with receptors and ion channels, which are often targets for drugs due to their roles in signal transduction pathways.
Step 3: The presence of the carboxylate group and the nitrile group might suggest that this molecule could be an inhibitor or substrate for enzymes such as cytochrome P450s (CYPs) like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs.
Step 4: Given the molecular structure and its potential to interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, the molecule may also influence genes related to neurotransmitter systems, such as DRD2, DRD3, and HTR2A, which are involved in dopamine and serotonin signaling respectively.
Step 5: The molecule’s structure also hints at possible interactions with genes involved in inflammation and cell signaling, such as PTGS1 (which encodes COX-2, an enzyme involved in prostaglandin synthesis) and KDR (a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in angiogenesis).
Summary of related gene names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, DRD2, DRD3, HTR2A, PTGS1, KDR. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups including a carboxylate group (-COOH), a nitrile group (-CN), and various aromatic rings.
