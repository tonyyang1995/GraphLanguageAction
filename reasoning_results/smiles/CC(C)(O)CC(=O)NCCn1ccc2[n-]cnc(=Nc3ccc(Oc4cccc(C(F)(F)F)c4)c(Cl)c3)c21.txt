Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)(O)CC(=O)NCCn1ccc2[n-]cnc(=Nc3ccc(Oc4cccc(C(F)(F)F)c4)c(Cl)c3)c21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains several functional groups such as amide (-CONH2), carboxylic acid (-COOH), phenyl ring (Ph), and heterocyclic rings like pyrrole and indole. These structural features suggest potential interactions with proteins involved in signal transduction, receptor binding, and enzyme activity.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) indicates that the molecule could act as an agonist or antagonist for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This aligns with the involvement of several genes in the list, particularly those encoding GPCRs like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, and ADRB2.
Step 3: The heterocyclic ring structures, specifically pyrroles and indoles, are common in ligands for nuclear receptors. Genes such as NR1D1 (related to CNR1) and NR1H2 (related to HCAR2, which is not listed but similar functionality) could be relevant due to their roles in hormone signaling and transcriptional regulation.
Step 4: The presence of fluorine atoms (-F) and chlorine (-Cl) suggests that the molecule may have been designed for selective targeting or pharmacokinetic optimization. This could relate to genes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, which encode enzymes responsible for metabolizing various drugs.
Step 5: Given the diverse functional groups and potential interactions with multiple protein targets, it is likely that this molecule has a broad pharmacological profile. However, based on the provided information, the most closely related genes appear to be those involved in GPCR signaling (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2), nuclear receptor function (CNR1, HCAR2, NR1H2), and drug metabolism (CYP2C19, CYP2D6).
Summary of Related Gene Names:
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- ABL1
- ADRB2
- CNR1
- HCAR2
- NR1H2
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
Note: HCAR2 is not explicitly mentioned in the provided list, but it is similar to CNR1 in terms of functionality and could be considered relevant given the presence of heterocyclic rings in the molecule. Additionally, NR1H2 is used as a proxy for HCAR2 since it is not listed in the provided gene set. The other genes listed are more directly related to the functional groups identified in the molecule. Step 1: The molecule contains several functional groups such as amide (-CONH2), carboxylic acid (-COOH), phenyl ring (Ph), and heterocyclic rings like pyrrole and indole. These structural features suggest potential interactions with proteins involved in signal transduction, receptor binding, and enzyme activity.
