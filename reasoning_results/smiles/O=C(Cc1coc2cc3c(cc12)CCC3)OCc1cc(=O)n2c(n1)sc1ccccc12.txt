Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Cc1coc2cc3c(cc12)CCC3)OCc1cc(=O)n2c(n1)sc1ccccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is common in many drugs that interact with various receptors and enzymes. This suggests potential interactions with genes encoding for receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) and an amide group (-CONH2) indicates the molecule could be a ligand for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as those encoded by ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, as these groups are often found in agonists and antagonists of these receptors.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a pyridine ring, which might interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, as these enzymes often bind to aromatic rings.
Step 4: Given the presence of a quinoline ring and carboxylic acid (-COOH), the molecule could also interact with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as CYP3A4, and possibly affect signaling pathways related to GPCRs, including HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure, the molecule may have potential interactions with multiple genes, including those involved in drug metabolism (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and neurotransmitter signaling (e.g., ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C).
Summary of related gene names:
- ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4
- CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C
These genes encode receptors and enzymes that the molecule may interact with based on its structural features. The interactions could involve binding, modulation of receptor activity, or alteration of enzyme function. However, without experimental data, the exact nature and strength of these interactions cannot be determined.
