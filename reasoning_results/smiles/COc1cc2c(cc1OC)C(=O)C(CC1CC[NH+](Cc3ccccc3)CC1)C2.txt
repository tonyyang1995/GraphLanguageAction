Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc2c(cc1OC)C(=O)C(CC1CC[NH+](Cc3ccccc3)CC1)C2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a complex structure with a benzene ring system, an amide group, and a thiazole ring, which are common features in many drugs that interact with receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring, amide, and thiazole suggests that this molecule might be involved in interactions with genes encoding for receptors and enzymes that recognize aromatic compounds and amides.
Step 3: The molecule also has a quinoline-like structure (C(=O)C(CC1CC[NH+](Cc3ccccc3)CC1)), which is characteristic of molecules that can interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as adrenergic and cholinergic receptors.
Step 4: Given the presence of these specific functional groups and structures, the molecule could potentially interact with genes encoding for receptors like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are known to have binding sites for aromatic compounds, amides, and quinolines.
Step 5: The molecule's structure also indicates potential interaction with genes involved in metabolism, such as CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, due to the presence of substituents that can be metabolized by these cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Summary of related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is often found in drug molecules that interact with various proteins, including receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group suggests potential interactions with enzymes that utilize amide bonds, such as those involved in metabolism or signaling pathways.
Step 3: The thiazole ring is a characteristic feature of molecules that can interact with certain receptor types, particularly G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule, including its aromatic and amide components, points towards possible interactions with genes encoding receptors like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and DRD2, as well as metabolic enzymes like CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
Step 5: Given the complexity and specific functional groups present in the molecule, it is likely to interact with multiple genes, but the primary focus would be on those involved in neurotransmission and metabolism.
Summary of related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring, which is commonly found in drug molecules that interact with various receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group suggests potential interactions with enzymes such as those
