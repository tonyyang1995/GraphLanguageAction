Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCC(CC)C(=O)NCc1ccc2c(c1)cc(C)n2C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule has a benzene ring with an amide group attached, suggesting it may interact with enzymes or receptors involved in neurotransmission or signal transduction. This structure could be related to genes encoding proteins that modulate neurotransmitter function or receptor activity.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and amide group is characteristic of many drugs that act as agonists or antagonists at various receptors, including those encoded by DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), HTR2A (serotonin receptor 5-HT2A), and HTR2B (serotonin receptor 5-HT2B). These genes are involved in regulating neurotransmitter signaling pathways.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a pyrrolidine ring, which might indicate potential interactions with proteins such as those encoded by OPRK1 (opioid receptor kappa 1), which plays a role in pain modulation and other physiological processes.
Step 4: The overall structure suggests the molecule could influence signaling pathways through its interactions with receptors and enzymes, potentially affecting genes like CYP2D6 (cytochrome P450 2D6) and CYP2C19 (cytochrome P450 2C19), which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its likely interactions, the related genes include: DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, OPRK1, CYP2D6, CYP2C19. 
Summary: DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, OPRK1, CYP2D6, CYP2C19. Step 1: The molecule has a benzene ring with an amide group attached, suggesting it may interact with enzymes or receptors involved in neurotransmission or signal transduction.
