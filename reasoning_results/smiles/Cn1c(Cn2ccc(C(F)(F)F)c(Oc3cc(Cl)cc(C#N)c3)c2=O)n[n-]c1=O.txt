Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cn1c(Cn2ccc(C(F)(F)F)c(Oc3cc(Cl)cc(C#N)c3)c2=O)n[n-]c1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups such as a benzene ring, a pyrrole ring, an amide group, and a nitro group. These features suggest that the molecule could be a potential ligand for receptors or enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) is characteristic of certain drugs that act as agonists or antagonists for various receptors. For example, nitro compounds can bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are known to be involved in numerous signaling pathways and are encoded by genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule contains a quinoline-like moiety, which is often found in ligands for cytochrome P450 enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These enzymes are involved in the metabolism of many drugs, and their activity can influence pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.
Step 4: The overall structure also suggests possible interactions with ion channels, given the presence of a carboxylate group and a benzene ring, which are common in molecules that modulate potassium channels. This could relate to genes encoding ion channels such as KCNH2.
Step 5: Based on the structural features identified, the molecule is likely to interact with several genes including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and KCNH2.
