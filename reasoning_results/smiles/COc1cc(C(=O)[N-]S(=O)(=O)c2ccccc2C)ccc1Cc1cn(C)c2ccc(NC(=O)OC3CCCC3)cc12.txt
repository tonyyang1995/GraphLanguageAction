Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc(C(=O)[N-]S(=O)(=O)c2ccccc2C)ccc1Cc1cn(C)c2ccc(NC(=O)OC3CCCC3)cc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule contains several functional groups including an amide (CO), a sulfonamide (S(=O)(=O)), and aromatic rings (c1cc...c1). These functional groups suggest the molecule has potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for similar structures.
Step 2: Analyzing the pattern of the molecule, it includes a core structure that could interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to the presence of nitrogen atoms and aromatic rings, which are common in ligands for these receptors.
Step 3: The presence of an amide group and a sulfonamide group suggests the molecule might interact with enzymes such as those involved in drug metabolism, like CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize drugs containing these functional groups.
Step 4: Given the presence of multiple nitrogen-containing heterocycles and aromatic rings, this molecule could also potentially interact with ion channels and transporters, possibly relating to genes such as KCNH2 (a potassium channel) and SLC6A4 (a serotonin transporter).
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and functional groups, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes involved in neurotransmitter systems, including DRD2, DRD3, and HTR2A, due to its potential to bind to these receptors.
Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2
- DRD3
- HTR2A
- CYP2D6
- CYP2C9
- CYP3A4
- KCNH2
- SLC6A4
These genes are primarily involved in neurotransmission, drug metabolism, and ion channel function, aligning with the structural characteristics of the provided molecule.
