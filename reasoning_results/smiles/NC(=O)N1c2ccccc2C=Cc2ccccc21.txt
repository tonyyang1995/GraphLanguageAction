Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NC(=O)N1c2ccccc2C=Cc2ccccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a structure that includes an amide group (-CONH-), which is characteristic of compounds that can act as inhibitors or modulators of receptors or enzymes. This amide group is part of the core structure of the molecule, suggesting it may interact with proteins containing amine binding sites.
Step 2: The presence of multiple aromatic rings (indicated by the 'c' characters in the SMILES string) suggests the molecule could have a high affinity for binding to receptors that recognize aromatic ligands, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The molecule also contains a quinoline-like moiety, which is often found in drugs targeting ion channels or transporters. This feature might suggest potential interactions with genes encoding ion channels or transporters.
Step 4: Considering the above structural features, the molecule could be related to genes encoding receptors, ion channels, or transporters. Specific examples include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A, KCNH2, LCK, and SLC6A4.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the molecule might be related to ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A, KCNH2, LCK, and SLC6A4. These genes are involved in various physiological processes, including neurotransmission, signal transduction, and drug metabolism. 
Related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A, KCNH2, LCK, SLC6A4.
