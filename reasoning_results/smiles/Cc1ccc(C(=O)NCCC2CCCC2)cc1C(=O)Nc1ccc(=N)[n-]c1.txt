Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(C(=O)NCCC2CCCC2)cc1C(=O)Nc1ccc(=N)[n-]c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a complex structure including a benzene ring system, a carbonyl group (C=O), and a nitro group (-NO2). These functional groups are often involved in binding to proteins and can interact with various receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) suggests potential interactions with enzymes that metabolize drugs, such as those involved in Phase I metabolism, like cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Step 3: The presence of amide groups (N-C=O) and amino groups (N-H) could indicate potential interactions with receptors and ion channels, such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ligand-gated ion channels.
Step 4: Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, this molecule might interact with several genes involved in neurotransmitter systems, including DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode for dopamine and serotonin receptors.
Step 5: The molecule also shows potential for interaction with kinases, such as LCK, due to its size and functional groups that can dock into kinase pockets.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, LCK.
