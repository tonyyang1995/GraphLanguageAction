Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)C1CCC[NH+](C(=O)CSCc2ccccc2)C1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring, an amide group, and several heteroatoms such as oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur. These functional groups are indicative of potential interactions with various receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and amide group suggests that this molecule could interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which often have hydrophobic binding sites for benzene rings and hydrogen bond acceptors like amides. Notable GPCRs include DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are involved in neurotransmitter signaling.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a thioether group (-S-) which might interact with cysteine residues in proteins, potentially affecting enzymes such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of multiple nitrogen atoms, particularly in the form of amine groups, suggests possible interactions with ion channels or transporters. For example, the molecule could bind to potassium channels like KCNH2 or neurotransmitter transporters like SLC6A2 and SLC6A4.
Step 5: Given the diverse structural features of the molecule, it is likely to have multiple modes of interaction with different genes, including but not limited to: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, KCNH2, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4. These genes are primarily involved in neurotransmission, hormone regulation, and drug metabolism. 
Summary of Related Genes: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, KCNH2, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
