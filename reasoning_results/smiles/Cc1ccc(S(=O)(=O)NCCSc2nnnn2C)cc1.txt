Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)NCCSc2nnnn2C)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string describes a molecule with a core benzene ring structure, featuring a sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)) attached to one of the carbon atoms and a nitrogen atom bonded to a second benzene ring. This structure suggests that the molecule could potentially interact with enzymes or receptors that are involved in the metabolism or signaling pathways related to this chemical scaffold.
Step 2: Notably, the sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)N) is commonly found in drugs that inhibit enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are part of the cytochrome P450 family. These enzymes play a significant role in drug metabolism. Therefore, the presence of this functional group in our molecule indicates a possible interaction with these enzymes.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule contains a phenolic group (phenyl ring connected to an oxygen), which might be recognized by receptors like HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A) and DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2). Both of these receptors are known to bind to various ligands and modulators, and the phenolic group could serve as a potential binding site for these receptors.
Step 4: The presence of multiple aromatic rings in the molecule may also suggest interactions with other enzymes or receptors involved in signal transduction pathways, such as PTGS1 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1), which is involved in the biosynthesis of prostaglandins.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure described, the most likely related genes include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, HTR2A, and DRD2.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP3A4
- HTR2A
- DRD2
