Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCc1ccc(C(=O)COC(=O)c2cccc(N3C(=O)c4c(C)nc5ccccc5c4C3=O)c2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with an acetyl group (C(=O)COC(=O)) attached to it. This structural feature suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and acetyl groups also indicates possible receptor interactions, particularly with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are known to be regulated by various factors, including those listed (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Step 3: The molecule's structure includes a quinoline-like motif (quinoline is a common scaffold for many drugs that interact with ion channels and receptors). This could potentially interact with ion channels like KCNH2.
Step 4: Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, the molecule may influence signaling pathways involving kinases and transcription factors. For instance, LCK (a tyrosine kinase) and PPARG (a nuclear receptor) could be relevant.
Step 5: The molecule's structure does not directly suggest strong interactions with other listed genes such as ABL1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CA12, CA2, CA9, CACNA1H, CDK2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CNR1, EGFR, ESR1, FLT1, HRH1, PTGS1, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, or MCL1, based on the provided structural analysis.
