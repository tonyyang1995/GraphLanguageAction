Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(NCc1ccc(F)cc1)c1c2c(nc3ccccc13)CCC2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule, represented by the SMILES string O=C(NCc1ccc(F)cc1)c1c2c(nc3ccccc13)CCC2, contains a benzene ring with a fluorine substituent (F) and a pyrrole ring. This complex structure suggests that the molecule could be involved in interactions with receptors or enzymes that have similar chemical features.
Step 2: The presence of the benzene ring and the fluorine substituent indicates potential binding to proteins that interact with aromatic compounds and possibly modulate their activity. Such proteins include receptors and transporters, which are often associated with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels.
Step 3: Among the listed genes, several are known to encode for GPCRs, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes encode for adrenergic receptors, muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, dopamine receptors, and serotonin receptors, respectively.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule’s structure might also suggest interactions with enzymes such as CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs and xenobiotics. These enzymes are part of the cytochrome P450 family and are crucial for the biotransformation of various compounds.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structural features, it is likely to interact with the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These genes encode for receptors and enzymes that could be directly affected by the molecule's chemical structure.
