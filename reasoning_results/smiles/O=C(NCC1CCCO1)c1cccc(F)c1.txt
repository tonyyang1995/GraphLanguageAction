Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(NCC1CCCO1)c1cccc(F)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyridine ring system, which is common in many drugs that interact with receptors such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels.
Step 2: The presence of fluorine atoms (-F) in the molecule suggests it may have specific interactions with proteins, particularly enzymes or transporters, due to its electronegativity.
Step 3: The overall structure includes a benzene ring and a cyano group (-CN), which are often found in molecules that interact with enzymes like CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, known for their role in drug metabolism.
Step 4: The molecule also has a quinoline-like structure, which could indicate potential interactions with receptors such as HTR2A and HTR2B, involved in serotonin signaling.
Step 5: Given the molecular features, the most likely related genes are CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, and HTR2B.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B.
