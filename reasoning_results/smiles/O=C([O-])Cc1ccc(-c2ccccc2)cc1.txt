Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])Cc1ccc(-c2ccccc2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule with a ketone functional group (O=C), an aromatic ring system (Cc1ccc(-c2ccccc2)cc1), and a negatively charged oxygen atom (-[O-]). The presence of a ketone and an aromatic ring suggests this molecule could be a potential ligand for receptors or enzymes that interact with such structural motifs.
Step 2: Analyzing the molecular structure, we observe that the aromatic ring system contains nitrogen atoms, which are part of amine groups. This structure is characteristic of molecules that can act as agonists or antagonists for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly those containing amines, such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2).
Step 3: The negatively charged oxygen atom (-[O-]) indicates the molecule has a negative charge, which can influence its interaction with positively charged sites on proteins, such as ion channels (CACNA1H, KCNH2) or receptors.
Step 4: Given the complexity of the molecule and its potential to interact with multiple targets, it is likely to have interactions with several genes involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways, including GPCRs (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1) and ion channels (CACNA1H, KCNH2).
Step 5: The molecule may also interact with genes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), and those involved in signal transduction pathways (CDK2, PTGS1).
