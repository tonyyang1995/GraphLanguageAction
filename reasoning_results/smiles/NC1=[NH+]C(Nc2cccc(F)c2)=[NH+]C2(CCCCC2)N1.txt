Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NC1=[NH+]C(Nc2cccc(F)c2)=[NH+]C2(CCCCC2)N1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex molecule containing multiple functional groups such as an amide, a nitrile, and several aromatic rings. This suggests the molecule may interact with proteins that have binding sites for these functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrile group (-CN) and amide (-CONH-) could indicate potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolic pathways. Specifically, this might relate to CYP (Cytochrome P450) enzymes, which are known to metabolize drugs and other xenobiotics. Among the listed genes, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 are all CYP enzymes.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a quinolone-like structure, which is characteristic of some neurotransmitter receptors and antagonists. This structural feature might suggest interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Among the listed genes, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 are serotonin receptors, while DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4 are dopamine receptors.
Step 4: Given the presence of a benzene ring and a nitrile group, the molecule might also interact with ion channels. Among the listed genes, KCNH2 codes for a voltage-gated potassium channel.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and functional groups, the molecule could potentially interact with a variety of genes involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmission. The related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, KCNH2.
Summary of Related Genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, KCNH2.
