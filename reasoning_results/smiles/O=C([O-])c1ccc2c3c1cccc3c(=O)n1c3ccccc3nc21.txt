Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])c1ccc2c3c1cccc3c(=O)n1c3ccccc3nc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule is a complex organic compound, specifically a small molecule with a structure that includes a carbonyl group (C=O), an amide linkage (-CO-NH-), and multiple aromatic rings. The presence of these functional groups suggests the molecule could interact with proteins involved in signaling pathways or metabolic processes.
Step 2: Notably, the molecule contains an amide group (-CONH-) which is characteristic of ligands that can bind to receptors such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This indicates potential interaction with genes encoding for GPCRs, which are known to have amine or amide-containing ligands.
Step 3: Given the presence of multiple aromatic rings, the molecule might also be able to interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism or transport. This suggests possible relevance to genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism or transport, such as those coding for cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP) and ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABCB).
Step 4: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) and a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) further supports the molecule’s potential to interact with enzymes involved in redox reactions and signal transduction pathways, which could be relevant to genes like PTGS1 (encoding cyclooxygenase-1), which plays a role in inflammation and pain.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes including ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, PTGS1, and SLC6A4. These genes encode proteins that could directly interact with or be influenced by the molecule through its pharmacological properties.
