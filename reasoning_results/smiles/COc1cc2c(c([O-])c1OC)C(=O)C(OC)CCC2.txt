Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc2c(c([O-])c1OC)C(=O)C(OC)CCC2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an amide group (-CONH-), suggesting it may interact with enzymes involved in metabolism such as CYP (Cytochrome P450) enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of an ester group (C(=O)O-) indicates potential interaction with receptors that bind fatty acids or similar molecules, such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) like DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2).
Step 3: The molecule has a quinoline-like structure, which could potentially interact with ion channels or transporters, such as SLC6A4 (Monoamine transporter).
Step 4: The presence of multiple aromatic rings and hydrophobic groups suggests the molecule might interact with membrane proteins, including receptors and ion channels.
Step 5: Given the structure and functional groups, the molecule is likely to be related to CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, DRD2, and SLC6A4.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, DRD2, SLC6A4. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an amide group (-CONH-), suggesting it may interact with enzymes involved in metabolism such as CYP (Cytochrome P450) enzymes.
