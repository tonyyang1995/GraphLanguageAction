Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring fused to a benzene ring, which is a common feature in many drugs that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural pattern suggests potential interactions with genes encoding for GPCRs.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a pyridine ring and a carboxamide group (-CONH2), which are known to interact with enzymes such as cytochrome P450s (CYP enzymes). This indicates possible relationships with genes involved in drug metabolism, like CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 3: The presence of an amide group and a quaternary ammonium salt (-N+(CH3)(-)) suggests the molecule could act as an agonist or antagonist for ion channels, which may be related to genes encoding ion channels such as KCNH2.
Step 4: The molecule has multiple aromatic rings and hydrophobic groups, which can facilitate binding to nuclear receptors. Genes like NR1H2 (LXRα) and NR1H3 (FXR) might be involved due to their role in regulating lipid metabolism.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and functional groups, the molecule is likely to interact with several genes, including those encoding GPCRs, CYP enzymes, ion channels, and nuclear receptors.
