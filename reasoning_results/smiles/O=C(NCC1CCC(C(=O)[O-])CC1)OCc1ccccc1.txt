Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(NCC1CCC(C(=O)[O-])CC1)OCc1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings, including an aromatic ring system, a carbonyl group, and several nitrogen atoms. This structure suggests it could be a ligand or inhibitor for receptors that interact with similar functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and a nitro group (-NO2) indicates the molecule might have electrophilic and nucleophilic sites, which are often recognized by enzymes such as CYP enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The molecule contains a benzene ring and a pyridine-like structure, which are common motifs recognized by receptors like ADRB2 (β2-adrenergic receptor) and DRD2 (Dopamine D2 receptor), both of which are involved in signaling pathways mediated by G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 4: The molecule also has a cyclic amide structure, which could potentially interact with enzymes like CYP2D6 and CYP2C9, known for their role in metabolizing various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 5: Given the structural features and the potential for interaction with enzymes and receptors, the related genes include CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, ADRB2, DRD2, and possibly other genes involved in GPCR signaling and drug metabolism pathways.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, ADRB2, DRD2.
