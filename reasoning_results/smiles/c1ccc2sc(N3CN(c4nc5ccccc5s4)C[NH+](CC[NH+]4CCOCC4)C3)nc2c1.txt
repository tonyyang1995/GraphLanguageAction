Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: c1ccc2sc(N3CN(c4nc5ccccc5s4)C[NH+](CC[NH+]4CCOCC4)C3)nc2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups including an amide, a phenol, and a nitro group. It also contains aromatic rings, which are characteristic of many small molecule ligands that interact with receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: Analyzing the genes listed, we look for those involved in drug metabolism, receptor function, and signaling pathways. The molecule’s potential interactions could be with genes encoding enzymes responsible for drug metabolism (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), receptors (e.g., ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HRH1), or signaling proteins (e.g., PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4).
Step 3: Given the presence of a nitro group and aromatic rings, the molecule likely interacts with enzymes involved in Phase I drug metabolism such as CYP enzymes. CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 are known to metabolize drugs containing similar functional groups.
Step 4: The molecule's ability to bind to receptors, particularly G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like adrenergic and serotonergic receptors, is suggested by its structural features. ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HRH1 encode such receptors.
Step 5: Summarizing, the molecule is potentially related to the following genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HRH1.
