Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)(C)n1nc(-c2ccc(Cl)cc2)c2c(=N)[n-]cnc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule in question contains a complex structure with multiple rings, including a pyrrole ring, a furan ring, and several aromatic rings. These structural elements suggest potential interactions with receptors that have similar or complementary binding sites.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule, particularly in a position that could form hydrogen bonds, indicates a possible interaction with receptors that have amino acid residues capable of forming hydrogen bonds. This is relevant for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which often have such binding sites.
Step 3: The molecule also includes chlorine atoms, which can participate in various types of interactions, including hydrophobic interactions and halogen bonding. These types of interactions are important for the binding of many drugs to their target proteins.
Step 4: Considering the presence of the nitrogen-containing heterocycles and the overall shape of the molecule, it is likely to interact with GPCRs, particularly those involved in neurotransmitter signaling pathways. This aligns with the presence of several GPCR-related genes in the provided list, such as DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis and the known functions of the genes, the molecule is most likely to be related to the genes encoding for GPCRs involved in neurotransmitter signaling. The related gene names are: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
