Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(NCc1ccc(Cl)cc1)c1ccc(Cl)cc1[N+](=O)[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure that includes an aromatic ring system, a cyano group (-CN), a nitro group (-NO2), and a guanidine moiety. These structural features suggest potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, particularly those associated with the cytochrome P450 (CYP) family and other drug-metabolizing enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group and a nitro group indicates that the molecule could be a substrate for CYP2E1 and CYP2C9, which are known to metabolize compounds containing these functional groups. Additionally, the guanidine moiety might interact with enzymes like CYP2C19, which is involved in the metabolism of drugs with basic functionalities.
Step 3: Given the structure of the molecule, it is likely to interact with receptors and ion channels. The nitro group and the overall polarity of the molecule suggest it could bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2) and HTR2A (Serotonin receptor 2A), which are involved in neurotransmission.
Step 4: The molecule’s structure also hints at possible interactions with voltage-gated potassium channels, given the presence of a guanidine moiety, which could potentially affect KCNH2 (Voltage-gated potassium channel subfamily H member 2).
Step 5: Considering the potential interactions with enzymes and receptors, the related genes include CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, and OPRL1 (Opioid receptor mu 1).
