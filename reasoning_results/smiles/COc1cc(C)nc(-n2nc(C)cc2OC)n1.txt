Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc(C)nc(-n2nc(C)cc2OC)n1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that contains a benzene ring (C6H6), a pyrrole ring (C4H5N), and several substituents including a cyano group (-CN), an amide group (-CONH2), and an alcohol group (-OH). This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes and receptors involved in signal transduction and metabolism.
Step 2: The molecule's presence of a cyano group (-CN) and amide group (-CONH2) indicates it could interact with enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of various drugs and xenobiotics through oxidation reactions.
Step 3: The presence of an alcohol group (-OH) might allow for binding to receptors or ion channels, such as HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A) and HTR2B (serotonin receptor 2B), which play roles in neurotransmission.
Step 4: The aromatic nature of the molecule could also suggest potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), like DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), which are involved in dopamine signaling pathways.
Step 5: Considering the above structural features, the molecule may be related to the following genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A, HTR2B, and DRD2.
Summary of Related Genes:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- DRD2 Step 5: Summary of Related Genes:
- DRD2
These genes are involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmission, which aligns with the molecular structure described.
