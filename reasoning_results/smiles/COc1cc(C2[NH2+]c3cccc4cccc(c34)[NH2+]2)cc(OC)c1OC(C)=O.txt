Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc(C2[NH2+]c3cccc4cccc(c34)[NH2+]2)cc(OC)c1OC(C)=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that includes several functional groups such as amides, esters, and a benzene ring system. The presence of multiple amide groups (NH2+) suggests the molecule could interact with proteins containing amine binding sites.
Step 2: The benzene ring system and the presence of ester groups suggest the molecule might be able to interact with proteins involved in receptor binding, enzyme activity, or signaling pathways. These types of interactions are common for molecules that target G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or enzymes.
Step 3: Among the given genes, several are known to encode GPCRs or enzymes that could potentially interact with this type of molecule:
- ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, KDR, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, SIGMAR1, and SLC6A2 all encode receptors or enzymes that could interact with the amide and ester groups of the molecule.
Step 4: The CYP (cytochrome P450) family of enzymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism, might also interact with this molecule due to its complex structure.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related gene names are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, KDR, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
