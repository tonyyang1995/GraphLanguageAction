Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])CSc1cc(NS(=O)(=O)c2ccc(Br)cc2)c2ccccc2c1[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains an acetyl group (O=C([O-])) and a carboxylate group (-COO-), which are characteristic functional groups often involved in drug metabolism and receptor binding. These functional groups are likely to interact with enzymes or receptors that play roles in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom bonded to a sulfur atom (NS(=O)(=O)) suggests the molecule may have a pharmacophore capable of interacting with proteins such as ion channels, receptors, or enzymes. This is particularly relevant for genes encoding proteins involved in neurotransmission and signaling.
Step 3: The aromatic ring system and halogen (Br) substitution in the molecule indicate potential interactions with proteins that are known to be involved in various physiological processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. This points towards genes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics and endogenous compounds.
Step 4: The presence of a quinoline-like structure (CSc1cc(NS(=O)(=O)c2ccc(Br)cc2)c2ccccc2c1[O-]) could suggest interactions with proteins that are part of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which includes genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C. These genes encode receptors that are involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release and signal transduction.
Step 5: Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups and structural motifs, the molecule is likely to have a broad range of interactions with several genes, but the most prominent ones appear to be those involved in signal transduction pathways, neurotransmission, and drug metabolism. The related gene names are summarized as follows:
- ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C
- CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4
- HRH1, KDR, LCK, MCL1, OPKR1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4
Note: CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4 are omitted as they primarily relate to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, which do not appear to be directly indicated by the molecular structure described. Similarly, EGFR, PTGS1, and SIGMAR1 are less likely to be directly related based on the provided information.
