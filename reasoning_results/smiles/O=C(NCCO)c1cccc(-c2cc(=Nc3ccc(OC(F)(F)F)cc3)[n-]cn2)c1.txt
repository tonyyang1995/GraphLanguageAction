Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(NCCO)c1cccc(-c2cc(=Nc3ccc(OC(F)(F)F)cc3)[n-]cn2)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that contains several functional groups such as an amide (N-C=O), a benzene ring (c1cccc1), and a nitro group (-NO2). This structure suggests the molecule could be a potential ligand for receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: Analyzing the pattern of the molecule, it includes a benzene ring which is often found in many drug molecules and can interact with various receptors and enzymes. Additionally, the presence of a nitro group (-NO2) can act as a functional group that might interact with proteins through hydrogen bonding or electrostatic interactions.
Step 3: Considering the possible interactions of this molecule with the given genes, the nitro group could potentially interact with receptors like HTR2A (Serotonin receptor 2A) and HTR2B (Serotonin receptor 2B), which are known to have binding sites for small molecules containing aromatic rings and polar functional groups.
Step 4: Furthermore, the benzene ring and other substituents in the molecule could also interact with enzymes such as CYP2D6 (Cytochrome P450 2D6) due to its ability to metabolize aromatic compounds.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related genes for this molecule include: HTR2A, HTR2B, and CYP2D6.
Summary of related gene names:
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- CYP2D6
The molecule may have potential interactions with these genes due to its structural features. However, further experimental validation would be required to confirm these predictions.
