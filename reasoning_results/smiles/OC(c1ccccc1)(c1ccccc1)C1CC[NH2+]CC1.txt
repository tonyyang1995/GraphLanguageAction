Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: OC(c1ccccc1)(c1ccccc1)C1CC[NH2+]CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure including a benzene ring (represented by "c1ccccc1") and an amide group ("[NH2+]"). The benzene rings are often involved in interactions with proteins, particularly those that are membrane-bound or have hydrophobic regions.
Step 2: The presence of the amide group suggests potential for interaction with receptors that have a carboxylate binding site, such as some G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are known to be involved in signaling pathways mediated by various neurotransmitters and hormones.
Step 3: Among the listed genes, several are known to encode GPCRs or enzymes that interact with GPCRs, including DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4. These genes are associated with the production of dopamine receptors and serotonin receptors, which can bind to ligands like the amide group present in the molecule.
Step 4: Additionally, CYP2D6, a cytochrome P450 enzyme involved in drug metabolism, could also potentially interact with this molecule due to its ability to metabolize drugs containing aromatic and amide groups.
Step 5: Summary of related genes: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2D6.

The molecule appears to be related to several genes involved in neurotransmitter and hormone receptor signaling, as well as drug metabolism. This is due to the presence of a benzene ring and an amide group, which are common features in molecules that interact with these types of biological targets. The related genes include dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), as well as the CYP2D6 gene, which is involved in the metabolism of certain drugs. Step 5:
