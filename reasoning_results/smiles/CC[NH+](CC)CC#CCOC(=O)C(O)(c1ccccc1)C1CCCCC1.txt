Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC[NH+](CC)CC#CCOC(=O)C(O)(c1ccccc1)C1CCCCC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure including a pyrrolidine ring, a benzene ring, and several substituents such as methyl groups, a phenyl group, and an acetyl group. These features suggest that the molecule could be a ligand for receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: Among the given genes, several are involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter systems, including HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4. These genes encode for different subtypes of serotonin and dopamine receptors, which are often targeted by small molecules due to their roles in various physiological processes.
Step 3: The molecule also has potential interactions with genes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. These cytochrome P450 enzymes play crucial roles in the metabolism of many drugs, including this molecule.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule may interact with genes related to ion channels and transporters, such as KCNH2 (a potassium channel) and SLC6A4 (a serotonin transporter). These proteins are involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis and could be affected by the molecule's presence.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and potential interactions, the related genes include: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, KCNH2, and SLC6A4. These genes are involved in neurotransmitter systems and drug metabolism, making them relevant to the molecule's potential biological activities. Step 5: Related Genes: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, KCNH2, SLC6A4.
