Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N=c1[n-]cnc2c1c(-c1cnc3[nH]ccc3c1)nn2C1CCCC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure featuring a nitrogen-nitrogen double bond (N=N), a benzene ring with an amine group (-NH), and a series of aromatic rings connected through carbon chains. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes that metabolize drugs, such as those encoded by CYP (Cytochrome P450) family genes.
Step 2: The presence of an amine group (-NH) and the overall aromatic nature of the molecule could indicate it may act as a ligand for receptors, particularly G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Among the listed genes, several are known to encode GPCRs, including HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 3: The benzene ring and nitrogen-containing heterocycles in the molecule might also suggest potential interactions with transporters, such as SLC6A2 and SLC6A4, which are involved in the reuptake of neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine.
Step 4: Considering the structural complexity and functional potential of the molecule, it is likely to interact with multiple targets, but the primary interactions are expected to be with enzymes involved in drug metabolism (CYPs) and receptors (GPCRs and transporters).
Step 5: Based on the analysis, the molecule is most likely to be related to the following genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4.
