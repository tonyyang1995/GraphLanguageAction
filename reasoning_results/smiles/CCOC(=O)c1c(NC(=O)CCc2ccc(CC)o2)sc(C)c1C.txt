Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)c1c(NC(=O)CCc2ccc(CC)o2)sc(C)c1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with an amide group attached, which is common in many ligands that interact with receptors such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature suggests potential interaction with genes encoding GPCRs.
Step 2: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in the molecule is characteristic of compounds that can act as inhibitors or agonists of certain receptors, particularly those involved in neurotransmission and hormone signaling.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a pyrrole ring, which is often found in molecules that modulate the activity of enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYP), indicating possible interactions with genes such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 4: Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, this molecule likely interacts with multiple receptors and enzymes, making it potentially related to several genes including but not limited to DRD2, HTR2A, and CYP2D6.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and functional groups identified, the related genes are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, and CYP3A4. 
Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP3A4. 
Note: HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 were included due to their commonality in the previous step, but they may be redundant in the final list. Adjustments might be needed for precision. 
Final List of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A.
