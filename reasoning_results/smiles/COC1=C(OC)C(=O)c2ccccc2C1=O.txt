Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COC1=C(OC)C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound, which appears to be a derivative of a benzene ring, featuring multiple rings and functional groups such as an amide (CON), a ketone (C=O), and several alkyl chains. This structure suggests it could interact with proteins involved in signaling pathways, transport, and metabolism.
Step 2: Analyzing the structure further, the presence of aromatic rings and functional groups like the amide and ketone could indicate potential interactions with enzymes or receptors that are known to bind to similar chemical structures. For example, CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) are involved in the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics, often through amide and ester hydrolysis reactions.
Step 3: The molecule's overall structure might also suggest interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are known for binding to ligands with similar chemical properties. Specifically, the amide and alkyl chain components could align with the binding pockets of adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 4: Given the presence of a ketone group and the overall complexity of the molecule, it might also engage in interactions with enzymes involved in metabolic pathways, such as those encoded by PTGS1, which codes for cyclooxygenase-1, an enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in prostaglandin synthesis.
Step 5: Based on the chemical structure and its potential interactions with various biological targets, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, PTGS1. 
Summary of related genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, PTGS1.
