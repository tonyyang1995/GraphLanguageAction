Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(-c2cc(=O)c3cc(Cl)ccc3o2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this is relevant.
Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring fused to a pyrrole ring, forming a tricyclic structure. This structure is characteristic of molecules that can interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are proteins involved in signal transduction pathways. The presence of multiple functional groups, such as a carbonyl group and a chlorine atom, suggests potential interactions with these receptors through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions.
Step 2: The pattern of substituents on the benzene ring, including the chlorine atom and the oxygen-containing group, may allow for specific binding to certain GPCRs. The chlorine atom could participate in hydrophobic interactions, while the oxygen-containing group might form hydrogen bonds. These interactions are critical for the recognition and activation of GPCRs.
Step 3: GPCRs are known to be involved in various physiological processes, including neurotransmission and hormone signaling. The genes associated with GPCRs include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes encode for different subtypes of GPCRs that are activated by various neurotransmitters and hormones.
Step 4: Given the structure of the molecule and its potential interactions with GPCRs, it is likely to be related to the genes encoding for these receptors. Specifically, the molecule could potentially interact with adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), and serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6. Step 5: Summary of Related Gene Names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
