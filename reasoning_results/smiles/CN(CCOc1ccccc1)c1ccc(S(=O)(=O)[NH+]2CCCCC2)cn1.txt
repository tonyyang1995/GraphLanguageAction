Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CN(CCOc1ccccc1)c1ccc(S(=O)(=O)[NH+]2CCCCC2)cn1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with multiple substituents, including a cyano group (-CN), an alcohol (-OH), a sulfoxide (-S(=O)-), and amide (-CONH-) functionalities. This complex structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group and amide functionality indicates that the molecule could be metabolized by enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to oxidize these functional groups.
Step 3: The sulfoxide group (-S(=O)-) might be recognized by enzymes such as CYP3A4, which can oxidize sulfur-containing compounds.
Step 4: The overall structure and functional groups suggest the molecule could interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to its size and hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance, potentially affecting genes like HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which encode serotonin receptors.
Step 5: The molecule's potential for interaction with metabolic enzymes and GPCRs implies it may have pharmacological effects related to genes involved in neurotransmission and metabolism, such as CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C.
