Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(N=c1[n-]ccs1)c1sc2cc(Cl)ccc2c1Cl, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this information might be useful.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrile group (-CN), which is typically associated with the metabolism of drugs by enzymes such as CYP2D6 and CYP2C19. These enzymes are involved in the oxidation of various substrates, including nitriles.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a sulfonamide moiety (SO2NH2), which is often metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. This functional group is known to be a common substrate for these enzymes, which catalyze the hydroxylation of the sulfur atom.
Step 3: The presence of a quinone-like structure, indicated by the benzene rings connected by a double bond and the chlorine atoms, suggests potential interactions with genes involved in redox reactions or oxidative stress. For instance, CYP1A2 is known to metabolize compounds containing quinone structures.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule has a pyrimidine ring, which may interact with genes involved in DNA repair or transcriptional regulation. CYP3A4, which is involved in the metabolism of many drugs, could also interact with this part of the molecule.
Step 5: The overall structure of the molecule, particularly its aromatic rings and functional groups, may suggest potential interactions with genes involved in G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathways. For example, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, and CHRM1-4, which encode for adrenergic and cholinergic receptors, might be relevant due to the presence of aromatic rings that can modulate receptor activity.
