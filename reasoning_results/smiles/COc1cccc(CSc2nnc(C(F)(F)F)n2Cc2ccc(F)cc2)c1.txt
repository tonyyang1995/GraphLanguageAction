Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cccc(CSc2nnc(C(F)(F)F)n2Cc2ccc(F)cc2)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains multiple rings, including a benzene ring and a furan ring, which are common in drugs targeting various receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of fluorine atoms (F) in the molecule suggests potential interactions with proteins that recognize or bind to fluorine, such as certain G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The molecule has a structure that could potentially interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2D6 and CYP2C9, due to its complexity and the presence of functional groups that can be metabolized by these enzymes.
Step 4: Given the aromatic nature and the presence of nitrogen-containing heterocycles, the molecule may interact with ion channels like KCNH2, which is part of the hERG potassium channel family.
Step 5: The molecule's overall structure might also influence its binding affinity for neurotransmitter receptors such as HTR2A and HTR2B, which are involved in serotonin signaling.
