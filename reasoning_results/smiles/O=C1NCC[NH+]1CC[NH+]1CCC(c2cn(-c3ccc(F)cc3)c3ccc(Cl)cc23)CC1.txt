Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C1NCC[NH+]1CC[NH+]1CCC(c2cn(-c3ccc(F)cc3)c3ccc(Cl)cc23)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring, which is a cyclic amine structure. This structural feature can interact with receptors that have amine binding sites, such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), cholinergic receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), and dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4). These interactions could modulate the activity of these receptors.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a quinoline moiety, which may suggest potential interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), given their role in metabolizing various compounds including those with quinoline structures. 
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a benzene ring system and functional groups like esters and amides might indicate possible interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP3A4, or with transport proteins like SLC6A2 and SLC6A4, which are involved in the uptake of neurotransmitters and other molecules.
Step 4: The molecule’s overall structure suggests it could be a ligand that interacts with ion channels, such as Cav1.2 (CACNA1H), which is encoded by the CACNA1H gene, potentially affecting calcium influx and cellular signaling.
Step 5: Considering the above structural features and potential interactions, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes involved in neurotransmitter regulation, metabolism, and ion channel function, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CACNA1H, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4. 
Summary of related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CACNA1H, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
