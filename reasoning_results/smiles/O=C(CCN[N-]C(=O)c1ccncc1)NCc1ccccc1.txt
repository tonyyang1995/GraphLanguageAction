Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(CCN[N-]C(=O)c1ccncc1)NCc1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring system and a benzene ring system, which are common in many drugs that interact with receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction. This structural pattern suggests potential interactions with genes encoding for receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom within the molecule indicates the possibility of amine functionality, which is often found in compounds that bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are associated with several of the listed genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a pyridine ring, which is known to be involved in binding to various enzyme systems including those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are all present in the list.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule’s overall structure suggests it may interact with proteins involved in ion channels and transporters, given its aromatic and amine functionalities. Genes like KCNH2, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4 are likely to be involved due to their roles in ion channel function and neurotransmitter reuptake.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is most likely to be related to the genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, KCNH2, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4. These genes encode for receptors and enzymes that could potentially interact with the molecule. 
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, KCNH2, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
