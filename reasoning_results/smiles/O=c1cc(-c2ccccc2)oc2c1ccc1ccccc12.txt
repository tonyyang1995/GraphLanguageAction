Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1cc(-c2ccccc2)oc2c1ccc1ccccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule is a complex aromatic compound containing multiple rings and a carbonyl group, suggesting potential interactions with enzymes or receptors involved in signal transduction or metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of aromatic rings and a carbonyl group could indicate possible binding to cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The molecule's structure might also suggest potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) or serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C).
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure could imply a potential interaction with enzymes like CYP1A2, which metabolizes various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and potential interactions, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C.
Summary of related genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C.
