Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cccc(N2CC[NH+](C(=O)CSCc3c(C)noc3C)CC2)c1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other type of content.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom that is part of an amide group (N2CC[NH+](C(=O)CSCc3c(C)noc3C)CC2), suggesting it could interact with proteins that have amine binding sites, such as receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a thiophene ring (CSCc3c(C)noc3C) and a benzene ring (Cc1cccc) indicates potential for interactions with aromatic amino acid residues, which are common in transmembrane regions of receptors and transporters.
Step 3: The molecule also has a carboxylic acid group (C(=O)C), which might allow it to bind to ion channels or other proteins with acidic residues.
Step 4: Given the complex structure with multiple functional groups, this molecule is likely to interact with a variety of proteins rather than just one or two specific genes.
Step 5: Therefore, the related genes include those encoding for receptors, transporters, and ion channels, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, KCNH2, and LCK. Step 5: Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, KCNH2, LCK.
