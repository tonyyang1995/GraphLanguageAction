Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOc1ccc(-c2ccc(Cn3c(CC(C)(C)C(=O)[O-])c(SC(C)(C)C)c4cc(OCc5ccc(C)cn5)ccc43)cc2)cn1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples.
Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings and functional groups such as hydroxyl (-OH), amine (-NH2), carboxyl (-COOH), and ester (-COOR). These functional groups suggest that the molecule may interact with proteins involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction and metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and a nitrogen atom in the molecule indicates potential interactions with enzymes and receptors that contain similar structures. Benzene rings are often found in ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes, while nitrogen atoms can form hydrogen bonds and participate in catalytic reactions.
Step 3: Considering the functional groups and the overall structure, the molecule could potentially interact with genes encoding proteins involved in neurotransmission, such as GPCRs. This is supported by the presence of amine groups, which are common in the structure of neurotransmitters and their receptors.
Step 4: The genes related to neurotransmission include DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes encode proteins that are involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release and signaling, making them likely targets for the described molecule.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule's structure might also be relevant to genes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These genes encode enzymes that play a crucial role in the biotransformation of xenobiotics, including drugs, and their interaction with the molecule could affect its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

Note: The molecule's structure suggests potential interactions with genes involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism, but the exact mechanism would require further experimental validation. The listed genes represent those most likely to have a significant relationship with the molecule based on its structural features. Other genes not mentioned here might also be relevant depending on the specific biological context.
