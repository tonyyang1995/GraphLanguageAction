Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+](C)CC[NH+]1C(=O)c2cccc3cc(N)cc(c23)C1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains several functional groups including amine (-NH2), amide (-CONH-), and ester (-COOR) functionalities. The presence of amine groups suggests potential interaction with receptors that have amine binding sites.
Step 2: The amide group in the molecule could potentially interact with enzymes that metabolize drugs, such as CYP (Cytochrome P450) enzymes like CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These enzymes are involved in drug metabolism and could influence the pharmacokinetics of the molecule.
Step 3: The ester functionality in the molecule might be recognized by esterases or other enzymes that cleave esters, such as CYP3A4, which is known to metabolize various drugs through hydrolysis of ester bonds.
Step 4: Given the pattern of the molecule, it also has the potential to interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). For example, the structure could bind to adrenergic receptors (like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) or dopaminergic receptors (like DRD2, DRD3, DRD4).
Step 5: The molecule’s structure also includes a benzene ring system, which is common in many drugs that interact with nuclear receptors such as PPAR gamma (PPARG), a target for anti-diabetic drugs.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, PPARG. 
Note: The gene names listed here are based on the potential interactions suggested by the molecule's structure and do not necessarily imply direct causality or functional relevance without further experimental evidence. Step 1: The molecule contains several functional groups including amine (-NH2), amide (-CONH-), and ester (-COOR) functionalities. The presence of amine groups suggests potential interaction with receptors that have amine binding sites.
