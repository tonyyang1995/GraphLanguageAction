Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(CC[NH2+]Cc2ccccc2F)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule in question contains a nitroso group (-NS(=O)(=O)-), which is a functional group known to be involved in various biological processes and can interact with proteins such as enzymes and receptors. This structural feature suggests potential interaction with genes encoding for proteins that have binding sites for nitroso-containing compounds.
Step 2: Additionally, the molecule includes a quinoline ring (c1ccc(CC[NH2+]Cc2ccccc2F)) that is often found in drug molecules due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds and π-π stacking interactions with proteins. This structural motif could indicate a potential interaction with genes encoding proteins that utilize these types of interactions for their function.
Step 3: Notably, the presence of a fluorine atom (F) within the quinoline ring is a common modification in drug design as it can increase lipophilicity, enhance metabolic stability, and improve drug-like properties. This modification might suggest a relationship with genes involved in drug metabolism or transport, such as those encoding for cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and drug transporters like SLC6A4.
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule, particularly the presence of the nitroso group and the quinoline ring, also hints at potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to their propensity to bind to aromatic and polar groups. Genes encoding for GPCRs include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and HTR1A-HTR6, which are involved in neurotransmission and hormone signaling.
Step 5: Based on the above structural and functional considerations, the molecule may be related to several genes, including those involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), GPCR signaling (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A-HTR6), and possibly drug transport (SLC6A4).
