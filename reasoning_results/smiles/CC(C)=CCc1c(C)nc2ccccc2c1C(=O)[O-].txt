Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)=CCc1c(C)nc2ccccc2c1C(=O)[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring with a double bond (C=C), a heterocyclic ring (cyclopentadienyl group), and an amide functional group (-CO-NH2). This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways or neurotransmission.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group could indicate that this molecule may interact with enzymes or receptors involved in the metabolism or signaling of neurotransmitters. For example, it might be a ligand for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as adrenergic (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 3: The cyclopentadienyl ring and overall molecular structure also suggest possible binding to ion channels or transporters. For instance, it could interact with voltage-gated calcium channels (CACNA1H) or GABA transporters (SLC6A2, SLC6A4).
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at one end of the molecule might allow it to act as a substrate for enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). This interaction could influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the molecule.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CACNA1H, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, SLC6A2, SLC6A4. These genes encode proteins that are directly involved in the binding, metabolism, and signaling processes of the molecule. 
Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CACNA1H, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
