Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(CSCc1ccccc1)Nc1cccc(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2C(=O)[O-])c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a cyano group and a nitrile group, which are common features in molecules that interact with ABL1 and CYP2C9. ABL1 is a tyrosine kinase involved in signal transduction pathways, and CYP2C9 is an enzyme that metabolizes various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 2: The presence of a cyclic amide and a phenolic hydroxyl group suggests potential interactions with enzymes like CYP2D6 and PTGS1. CYP2D6 is involved in the metabolism of many drugs, while PTGS1 (also known as COX-1) is an enzyme involved in prostaglandin biosynthesis.
Step 3: The molecule has a quinoline-like structure with a nitrogen-containing heterocycle, which could be relevant for compounds interacting with CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. These enzymes are important in drug metabolism and are known to metabolize a wide range of substrates.
Step 4: The presence of a substituted amide and a carboxamide group indicates possible interactions with enzymes such as CYP2C19 and HTR2A. CYP2C19 is involved in the metabolism of several drugs, and HTR2A is a serotonin receptor involved in neurotransmission.
Step 5: The overall structure and functional groups of the molecule suggest potential interactions with CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. These genes encode enzymes that play significant roles in drug metabolism.
