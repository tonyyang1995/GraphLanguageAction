Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(=O)[N-]N1C(=O)c2ccc(Oc3cccc([N+](=O)[O-])c3)cc2C1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other type of explanation.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a carboxamide group and a nitroimidazole ring, which are characteristic features of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). This suggests potential interaction with serotonin-related genes.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group and an imidazole ring indicates a possible interaction with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), specifically those involved in neurotransmitter signaling.
Step 3: The molecule's structure aligns with known ligands for serotonin receptors (5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C), suggesting it may interact with these receptors.
Step 4: Given the interaction with serotonin receptors, the molecule is likely to be related to genes encoding these receptors: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2C, HTR2B, HTR6.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule's structure might also interact with dopamine receptors, indicated by its potential to bind to D2-like receptors, thus relating to genes DRD2 and DRD3.
Summary of related genes: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3.
