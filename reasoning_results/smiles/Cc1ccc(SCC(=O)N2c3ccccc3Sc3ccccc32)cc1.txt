Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(SCC(=O)N2c3ccccc3Sc3ccccc32)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a sulfur atom attached, suggesting it may interact with proteins that have sulfhydryl groups or are involved in sulfur-containing metabolic pathways.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (SCC(=O)N) indicates potential interaction with enzymes or receptors that have amine or amide binding sites.
Step 3: The aromatic rings and substituents suggest the molecule could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways or ion channels.
Step 4: Given the structural complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, the molecule might interact with enzymes or receptors that are part of drug metabolism pathways, such as those involving cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Step 5: Based on the molecular features, the related genes likely include those involved in drug metabolism and transport, such as CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, and possibly ABCB1 for transport functions.
