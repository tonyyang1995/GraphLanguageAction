Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: OCCn1cc(-c2cnc3nnn(Cc4ccc5ncccc5c4)c3n2)cn1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system and a pyrrole ring, which are common structural motifs in ligands that interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This suggests potential interaction with GPCRs.
Step 2: The presence of multiple nitrogen atoms, particularly in the pyrrole and amide groups, indicates potential for hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, which are important for receptor binding.
Step 3: The molecule has a long alkyl chain and a carboxylic acid group, which could facilitate binding to enzymes involved in drug metabolism such as CYP enzymes.
Step 4: Considering the structural features and potential interactions, the molecule may be related to GPCRs and enzymes involved in drug metabolism. Specific genes like DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and CYP2D6 could be relevant due to their roles in neurotransmission and drug metabolism.
Step 5: Summary of related genes: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2D6. Step 5: Summary of related genes: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2D6.
