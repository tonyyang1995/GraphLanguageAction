Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C=CC(=O)Nc1cccc(Oc2[n-]c(=Nc3ccc(N4CC[NH+](C)CC4)cc3OC)ncc2Cl)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound with a structure that includes a benzene ring system, an amide group, and an amino group. The presence of these functional groups suggests potential interactions with receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmission or metabolism.
Step 2: The benzene ring system and the amide group are common in drugs that target G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are proteins that play crucial roles in signaling pathways involving neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin. This structural similarity could imply a relationship with genes encoding for receptors that interact with these neurotransmitters.
Step 3: The amino group might also indicate a potential interaction with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP (cytochrome P450) family genes, which are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 4: Considering the neurotransmitter-related receptors and metabolic enzymes, the molecule could be related to several genes, including but not limited to: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
Step 5: Summary of related gene names: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
Related Gene Names:
- Dopamine Receptors: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4
- Serotonin Receptors: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptors: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4
- Cytochrome P450 Enzymes: CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4
This summary focuses on the potential interactions based on the molecule's structure and the biological roles of the genes listed. The relationships are inferred from the commonality of the functional groups in the molecule and the biological functions of the target genes. Other genes may also be relevant, depending on further detailed analysis.
