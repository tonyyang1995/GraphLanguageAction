Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COC(=O)CCc1ccc(OCC(O)C[NH2+]C(C)C)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (COOH) and an amide group (C=O), indicating it is likely an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor or modulator. This structural feature suggests potential interactions with cholinergic receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a pyrrolidine ring (NCCN) and an oxazolone group (C1=CN=O) further supports its potential to interact with receptors that have similar functional groups, such as muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.
Step 3: The overall structure and functional groups of the molecule suggest it may be involved in modulating the activity of cholinergic pathways, which are influenced by genes encoding for various cholinergic receptors and enzymes.
Step 4: Given the cholinergic pathway modulation, the molecule could be related to several genes involved in neurotransmission, including CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode for different subtypes of serotonin receptors.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule might interact with the cannabinoid receptor CNR1 and the dopamine receptor DRD2 due to the presence of aromatic rings and potential ligand binding sites.
