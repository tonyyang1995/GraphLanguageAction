Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+](C)CCN(Cc1cccs1)c1ccccn1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with a central nitrogen atom that has a positive charge, forming a quaternary amine. This nitrogen is bonded to two methyl groups and a phenyl ring, indicating potential interactions with proteins involved in receptor binding or transport processes.
Step 2: The presence of a phenyl ring and the overall structure suggest that this molecule could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, particularly those containing hydrophobic binding sites for small molecules. This aligns with the presence of several G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other signaling molecules listed among the genes.
Step 3: The molecule’s basic nature due to the positively charged nitrogen suggests it might interact with ion channels or transporters, which are also represented by some of the listed genes such as KCNH2 (potassium channel subfamily H member 2).
Step 4: Given the complexity and size of the molecule, it is plausible that it could modulate multiple biological pathways involving various neurotransmitters and hormones, aligning with the presence of several receptor genes like DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CNR1, and ESR1.
Step 5: Considering the broad range of potential interactions, the molecule could be related to multiple genes including ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein), CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, PTGS1, and SLC6A4, which are involved in drug metabolism, transport, and signaling.
