Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc(-c2cc(C)c([O-])c(C)c2)cc(C)c1[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a negatively charged oxygen atom (-O-) attached to it. This pattern suggests the molecule may interact with proteins that have specific binding sites for acidic or negatively charged groups.
Step 2: The molecule also has a cyclic structure with multiple carbon atoms and a hydroxyl group (-OH). This type of structure might be recognized by enzymes or receptors that have hydrophobic binding pockets or active sites.
Step 3: Considering the presence of a benzene ring and a hydroxyl group, the molecule could potentially interact with enzymes involved in phase I metabolism such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 4: The molecule's overall structure and charge distribution may also interact with ion channels or receptors, which could involve genes like KCNH2 (hERG potassium channel) and HTR2A (serotonin receptor).
Step 5: Based on the structural features, the related genes include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, KCNH2, HTR2A. Step 5: Related genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, KCNH2, HTR2A.
