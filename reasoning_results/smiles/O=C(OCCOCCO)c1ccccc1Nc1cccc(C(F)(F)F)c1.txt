Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(OCCOCCO)c1ccccc1Nc1cccc(C(F)(F)F)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains multiple functional groups including an amide (-CONH-), esters (-COOR), and a heterocyclic ring (indicated by 'c1ccccc1'). These functional groups suggest potential interactions with proteins involved in various physiological processes.
Step 2: The presence of fluorine atoms (F) in the molecule, specifically trifluoromethyl groups (-CF3), indicates that it may have specific binding affinities for proteins that recognize such substituents, which are common in drug design targeting enzymes or receptors.
Step 3: The molecule's overall structure, particularly the aromatic rings and heterocyclic nitrogen, suggests potential interaction with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This class of receptors includes several of the listed genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and HRH1.
Step 4: The molecule's amide and ester functionalities indicate possible interactions with enzymes that contain catalytic sites for these functional groups, such as CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Step 5: Given the molecule's structure and functional groups, it is most likely to interact with genes encoding for GPCRs and enzymes involved in metabolic pathways. Therefore, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, and CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. 
Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
