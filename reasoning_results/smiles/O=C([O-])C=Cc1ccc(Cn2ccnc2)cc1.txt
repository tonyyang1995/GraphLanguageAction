Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])C=Cc1ccc(Cn2ccnc2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound containing a ketone (O=C), an alcohol (O-), and a benzene ring (c1ccc(Cn2ccnc2)cc1). This structure suggests that it could be a ligand or substrate for enzymes involved in drug metabolism and signaling pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a ketone group and a benzene ring indicates potential interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes, specifically CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. These enzymes are known to metabolize a wide range of drugs and xenobiotics, including those with similar chemical structures.
Step 3: The aromatic ring and nitrogen-containing heterocycle in the molecule suggest possible interactions with receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), which are known to bind to various ligands and modulators.
Step 4: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule could also indicate potential binding to G-protein coupled receptors like HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are involved in neurotransmission and are often targets for psychiatric medications.
Step 5: Given the structural features and potential interactions described, the related genes include: CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C.
