Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)[NH+]1CCC(NC(=O)CCC(=O)N2CCOc3ccccc32)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that includes a benzene ring, an amide group, and a positively charged nitrogen atom. This structural pattern suggests the molecule could be a drug-like compound, potentially interacting with proteins that have similar chemical groups.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-CO-NH-) is particularly notable, as it is a common functional group in many drugs and can form hydrogen bonds, which are important for binding to proteins such as receptors and enzymes. This indicates potential interaction with proteins that have binding sites for amides.
Step 3: The positively charged nitrogen atom within the molecule could suggest it has basic properties, which might allow it to interact with acidic protein binding sites, such as those found in ion channels or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 4: Considering the genes listed, several are involved in neurotransmitter systems or receptor functions, including HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and CNR1. These genes encode for various receptors that could potentially bind to the molecule due to its amide group and possible basic nature.
Step 5: Additionally, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 are involved in drug metabolism, meaning the molecule might be metabolized by these enzymes, suggesting a potential pharmacological interaction.
Summary of Related Genes:
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4
- CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CNR1
- CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4
These genes encode proteins that could interact with the described molecule based on its chemical structure and properties.
