Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: OCCN(CCO)c1nc(N2CCCCC2)c2nc(N(CCO)CCO)nc(N3CCCCC3)c2n1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure featuring multiple rings, including a benzene ring (indicated by the presence of C6 atoms), a pyrrole ring (N3), and a furan ring (O3). The molecule also contains several nitrogen and oxygen atoms that could participate in hydrogen bonding, which is important for interactions with proteins.
Step 2: Analyzing the structure further, we see that the molecule contains a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to a benzene ring, which is a common feature in ligands that interact with receptors like G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and kinases. Additionally, the presence of amide groups (-CONH-) suggests potential binding sites for enzymes such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: Given the structural features of the molecule, it is plausible that it could interact with genes encoding enzymes involved in metabolism, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. These enzymes are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics, and their activity can be influenced by small molecules similar to the given structure.
Step 4: Furthermore, the presence of amine groups (-NH2) and the overall shape of the molecule might allow it to bind to ion channels, such as KCNH2, which encodes the hERG potassium channel. This type of interaction could modulate the function of the channel, leading to changes in cellular signaling pathways.
Step 5: Considering the above points, the molecule is likely to have relationships with genes involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4) and ion channel modulation (KCNH2). Other genes listed may not directly relate to the molecular structure described.
Summary of related gene names: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, KCNH2.
