Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C1NCC[NH+]1c1ncc([N+](=O)[O-])s1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring system with an amide group attached, which is characteristic of many ligands that interact with receptors and enzymes. This structural feature suggests potential interaction with genes encoding receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (N+), along with a carboxylate group (-COOH) and a sulfhydryl group (-SH), indicates the molecule could act as a ligand for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or ion channels. This pattern is relevant to genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, and HRH1, which encode receptors that may interact with this type of ligand.
Step 3: The aromatic ring systems and the overall hydrophobic nature of the molecule suggest it could be a substrate for P-glycoprotein (ABCB1), a membrane protein involved in drug efflux. This property links the molecule to the ABCB1 gene.
Step 4: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) and the overall molecular structure indicate potential interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2D6 and CYP2C9, which are involved in metabolizing various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 5: The overall chemical structure does not strongly suggest direct interactions with neurotransmitter receptors encoded by genes like HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, or HTR6, as the molecule lacks typical neurotransmitter binding motifs.
Summary of related gene names: ABCB1, ABL1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HRH1, CYP2D6, CYP2C9.
