Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(-c2noc(C[NH+](C(=O)C(c3ccccc3)c3ccccc3)C(C)C)n2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound, containing multiple functional groups such as aromatic rings, amine groups, and carboxylate groups. This structure suggests it could interact with proteins that have binding sites for similar functional groups.
Step 2: Upon closer inspection, the molecule contains a quinoline-like structure (Cc1ccc(-c2noc(C[NH+](C(=O)C(c3ccccc3)c3ccccc3)C(C)C)n2)cc1), which often binds to receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmitter signaling and metabolism.
Step 3: The presence of an amide group (C[NH+](C(=O)C) and carboxylate group (C(=O)C) indicates potential interactions with proteins that contain amino acid residues with complementary charges, such as ion channels or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 4: Given the complexity and specific structure of the molecule, it is likely to interact with proteins involved in neurotransmitter systems, such as receptors and transporters. This aligns with several of the listed genes that are known to be involved in neurotransmission, including HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which encode for various serotonin and dopamine receptors.
Step 5: The molecule may also interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, due to its complex structure and potential for substrate or inhibitor activity.
