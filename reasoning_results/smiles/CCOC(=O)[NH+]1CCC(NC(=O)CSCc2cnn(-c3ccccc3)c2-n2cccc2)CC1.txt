Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)[NH+]1CCC(NC(=O)CSCc2cnn(-c3ccccc3)c2-n2cccc2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound with a central carbon atom connected to an oxygen atom via a carbonyl group (CO), and a positively charged nitrogen atom (N+). This structure suggests it could be a derivative of aminoglycosides or similar molecules that interact with receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a cyclic structure (c2cnn(-c3ccccc3)c2-n2cccc2) indicates potential for aromaticity and possibly interaction with aromatic amino acid residues in proteins, which are common in receptor binding sites.
Step 3: The molecule also contains sulfur atoms (S) and chloride ions (-Cl), which could indicate the presence of functional groups such as thioesters or halogenated compounds. These functional groups might interact with specific enzymes like CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: Given the complexity and potential for interactions with multiple biological targets, the molecule might have a broad impact on various signaling pathways and receptors. For instance, it could interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like DRD2 (dopamine D2 receptor), HTR1A (serotonin 1A receptor), and HRH1 (histamine H1 receptor).
Step 5: Considering the diverse pharmacological profiles and potential binding sites, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR1A, HRH1.
