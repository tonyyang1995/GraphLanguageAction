Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCOc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)Nc2cccnc2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with an attached sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)N), which suggests potential interaction with drug transporters and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a pyrrole ring and a quinoline-like structure indicates possible binding to receptors such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The molecule’s hydrophobic core, likely due to the alkyl chains, may facilitate its interaction with membrane-bound proteins like receptors and ion channels.
Step 4: Given the structure, it could interact with genes encoding for drug-metabolizing enzymes (e.g., CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and transporters (e.g., ABCB1).
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule might bind to receptors such as HTR2A (serotonin receptor) and DRD2 (dopamine receptor).
