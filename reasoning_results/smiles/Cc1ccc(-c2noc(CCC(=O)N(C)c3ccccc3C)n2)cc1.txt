Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(-c2noc(CCC(=O)N(C)c3ccccc3C)n2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule, likely a pharmaceutical compound due to its structural complexity and functional groups such as amides, esters, and aromatic rings. This suggests the molecule could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction, receptor binding, or enzyme activity.
Step 2: Analyzing the chemical structure for potential interactions with receptors or enzymes, we notice the presence of an amide group (-CONH-) and an ester group (C(=O)O-), which are common in drugs that target G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYPs).
Step 3: Considering the pattern of the molecule and its potential interactions:
- The amide and ester groups suggest possible interactions with GPCRs, which are often targeted by drugs affecting neurotransmission.
- The presence of aromatic rings indicates potential binding to enzymes or receptors through hydrogen bonding or hydrophobic interactions.
Step 4: Given the molecular features, the most likely targets among the provided genes would be those involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism. These include:
- G-protein coupled receptors (e.g., DRD2, HTR2A, CHRM1)
- Enzymes involved in drug metabolism (e.g., CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4)
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names: DRD2, HTR2A, CHRM1, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. These genes encode proteins that could interact directly with the described molecule or are part of pathways influenced by it.
