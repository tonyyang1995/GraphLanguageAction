Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=S(=O)(Nc1ccc(Cc2ccncc2)cc1)c1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a structure that includes a sulfur-oxygen double bond (S=O) and a nitro group (-NO2). These functional groups are characteristic of certain drugs that interact with enzymes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism and signal transduction.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom bonded to a benzene ring (Nc1...) suggests the molecule may have properties similar to those of ligands that bind to receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 3: The molecule also contains a benzene ring with a chlorine substituent (Cl), which could indicate interactions with proteins that include chloride binding sites, such as the calcium channel subunit CACNA1H.
Step 4: Given the overall structure and functional groups, this molecule might influence the activity of enzymes like CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs, including those that affect serotonin receptors (HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C).
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule could be related to several genes including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CACNA1H, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C.
