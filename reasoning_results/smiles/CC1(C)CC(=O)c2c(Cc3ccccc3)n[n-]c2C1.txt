Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC1(C)CC(=O)c2c(Cc3ccccc3)n[n-]c2C1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple rings and functional groups such as amides, amines, and cyclohexane rings. These structural features suggest that the molecule may interact with proteins involved in signaling pathways or transport mechanisms.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of an amide group (-CONH-) and a cyclic structure could indicate potential interactions with enzymes or receptors involved in neurotransmitter metabolism or signal transduction.
Step 3: Considering the pattern of substituents and the overall shape of the molecule, it might be designed to fit into a receptor site or enzyme active site, potentially modulating their activity. This could relate to genes encoding for receptors or enzymes that are part of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family or cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Step 4: Among the provided genes, those involved in GPCR signaling (e.g., DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4) and those involved in drug metabolism (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) are the most likely candidates for interaction with this molecule due to its structural features.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and the potential for interaction with receptors and metabolic enzymes, the related genes include: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. 
Summary of related gene names: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
