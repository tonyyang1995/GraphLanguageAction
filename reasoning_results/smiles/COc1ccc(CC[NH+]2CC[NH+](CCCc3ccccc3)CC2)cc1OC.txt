Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(CC[NH+]2CC[NH+](CCCc3ccccc3)CC2)cc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with a quinoline moiety attached, which includes nitrogen atoms that can act as basic sites for binding to proteins. This structural feature is relevant to genes involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways, as these receptors often bind to basic molecules.
Step 2: The molecule also has a pyrrolidine and piperazine ring system, which are common in ligands that interact with neurotransmitter receptors. This suggests potential interactions with genes encoding for various neurotransmitter receptors such as adrenergic (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), cholinergic (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), and dopaminergic (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) receptors.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) binding site in the molecule indicates that it may be metabolized by these enzymes, affecting their activity and potentially impacting their associated genes.
Step 4: The molecule's ability to potentially interact with GPCRs and neurotransmitter receptors makes it relevant to genes involved in signaling pathways modulated by these receptors, such as HRH1 (histamine H1 receptor) and HTR1A (serotonin 1A receptor).
Step 5: The summary of related gene names includes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HRH1, HTR1A.
