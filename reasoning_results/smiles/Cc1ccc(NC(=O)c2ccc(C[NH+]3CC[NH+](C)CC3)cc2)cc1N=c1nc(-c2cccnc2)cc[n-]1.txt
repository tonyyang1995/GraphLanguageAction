Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple functional groups such as a benzene ring, amide (-CONH2), and a nitrogen atom with positive charge (N+). These structural features suggest the molecule could interact with proteins that have similar chemical functionalities.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-CONH2) indicates potential binding to enzymes or receptors that recognize this functional group. Additionally, the positively charged nitrogen suggests the molecule might interact with ion channels or transporters that have sites for positively charged molecules.
Step 3: The benzene ring and its substitution pattern, including the presence of a nitrile group (-CN) and an amide, are characteristic of compounds that can interact with various proteins, including enzymes and receptors involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 4: Considering the structure, the molecule may be related to genes encoding proteins involved in neurotransmitter signaling, ion channel function, and drug metabolism. This is because it has characteristics that could interact with receptors and transporters involved in these processes.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure, the following genes are likely to be related: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and SLC6A4. These genes encode proteins involved in neurotransmitter signaling, receptor function, and drug metabolism.
