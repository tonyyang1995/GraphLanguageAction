Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1c(N(C)C)c(=O)n(-c2ccccc2)n1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound with a benzene ring, a pyrrolidine ring, an amide group, and a nitrile group. These structural features suggest that the molecule might interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways or transport functions.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and an amide group is common in many ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). The molecule also contains a nitrile group, which can form hydrogen bonds, potentially interacting with acidic residues in receptor binding sites.
Step 3: Given the pattern of the molecule, it could be a ligand for receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) or dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), which are known to have benzene rings and amide groups in their ligands. The nitrile group may also play a role in interacting with these receptors.
Step 4: The molecule's structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), given the presence of functional groups that are substrates for these enzymes.
Step 5: Considering the detailed structure and functional groups, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. 
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
