Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC1(C)c2nc(-c3ccc(F)cc3)c(Nc3ccc(F)cc3)n2CC[NH+]1C(=O)C[NH3+], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains several functional groups such as amide (C(=O)N), amino (NH2), and fluorine substituents (-F). These features suggest that the molecule could potentially interact with proteins involved in neurotransmission or drug metabolism.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of an amide group (C(=O)N) indicates that this molecule could be a ligand for receptors that recognize amide-containing compounds, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The molecule also includes a pyrrolidine ring system, which is a common structural motif found in many drugs that act on GPCRs. This further supports the possibility of the molecule interacting with GPCRs.
Step 4: Given the potential interaction with GPCRs, the following genes are likely to be related to the molecule: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and DRD2, DRD3, DRD4. These genes encode for various subtypes of GPCRs and enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 5: The related gene names are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4. 
Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4. 
These genes are involved in the regulation of neurotransmission through GPCRs and drug metabolism. The molecule's structure suggests it may interact with these receptors and enzymes.
