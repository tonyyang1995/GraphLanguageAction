Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccccc1OCC(O)COC(N)=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a benzene ring system with an oxygen atom attached to it (phenol group), which is common in many drugs that interact with receptors or enzymes. This suggests potential interactions with genes encoding drug targets such as receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a carbonyl group (-CO-) and an amide (-CONH-), along with the overall molecular complexity, indicates this molecule could be an inhibitor or substrate for various enzymes, particularly those involved in metabolism and signaling pathways. This points towards potential interactions with genes like CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize numerous drugs.
Step 3: The presence of a quinone-like structure (indicated by the double bond in the ring) suggests possible interaction with genes involved in oxidative stress responses or redox regulation, such as PTGS1 (which encodes COX-2, involved in inflammation).
Step 4: Given the presence of multiple functional groups (phenolic, carbonyl, amide) and its overall chemical complexity, this molecule may also interact with neurotransmitter receptors. This could potentially relate to genes like HTR2A (serotonin receptor) and DRD2 (dopamine receptor), which are crucial for neurotransmission.
Step 5: Considering the molecule's structural complexity and the potential for it to act as a ligand for various proteins, it might interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This includes genes like CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4 (muscarinic acetylcholine receptors), which play roles in neurotransmission and ion channel regulation.
