Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(c1ccccc1)c1ccc2n1CCC2C(=O)[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrile group (-CN) attached to a benzene ring, which is characteristic of molecules that may interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 2: The molecule also includes an amide group (-CONH2), which can be metabolized by CYP2D6, another enzyme involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The presence of a carboxylate group (-COO-) suggests potential interaction with genes involved in G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and HRH1, as these often bind ligands containing carboxylate groups.
Step 4: The aromatic nature of the molecule and its potential to form hydrogen bonds might interact with genes encoding ion channels such as KCNH2.
Step 5: Given the structure and functional groups, the molecule could potentially interact with multiple genes involved in neurotransmitter systems, including DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
