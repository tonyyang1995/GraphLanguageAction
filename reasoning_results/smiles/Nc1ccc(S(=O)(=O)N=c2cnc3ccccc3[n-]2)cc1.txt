Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Nc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)N=c2cnc3ccccc3[n-]2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) attached to a benzene ring, which is a common pharmacophore for drugs that interact with certain receptors and enzymes. This structure suggests potential interactions with genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes and receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a quinolone-like moiety (quinoline ring system) in the molecule indicates possible interactions with genes involved in G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathways, particularly those associated with adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors.
Step 3: The aromatic nitro group (-NO2) is present, which could indicate a potential interaction with genes involved in inflammatory responses and neurotransmission, such as those encoding enzymes like CYP2D6 and PTGS1.
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule includes a benzene ring system and heteroatoms (S, O, N), which are typical features of molecules that interact with receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways. This suggests possible interactions with genes encoding neurotransmitter receptors and enzymes, such as HTR2A, DRD2, and CYP2C9.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule may be related to several genes involved in neurotransmission, inflammation, and drug metabolism, including: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, PTGS1, and others.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2D6
- CYP2C9
- CYP3A4
- DRD2
- HTR2A
- PTGS1
- Others (as mentioned in the analysis) To provide a more comprehensive list, you might also consider adding genes related to G-protein coupled receptors and other signaling pathways, but based on the given information, the above list is the most directly relevant. Step 1: The molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) attached to a benzene ring, which is a common pharmacophore for drugs that interact with certain receptors and enzymes. This structure suggests potential interactions with genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes and receptors.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule may be related to several genes involved in neurotransmission, inflammation, and drug metabolism, including: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, PTGS
