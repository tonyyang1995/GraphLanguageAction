Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1[n-]c2cc(C(F)(F)F)ccc2n1-c1cc(C(F)(F)F)ccc1[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a tricyclic core with an aromatic nitro group (-NO2) attached to it. This structural feature suggests that the molecule may be related to neurotransmitter receptors or enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of fluorine atoms (F) in the molecule indicates that it could potentially interact with proteins containing fluoride binding sites, which are often found in certain receptor families like G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are known to be regulated by various signaling pathways and are associated with multiple genes listed here.
Step 3: The aromatic nitro group (-NO2) is a common functional group found in drugs targeting enzymes such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs. Several CYP-related genes are listed (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), suggesting that the molecule might have metabolic effects linked to these genes.
Step 4: Given the overall structure and functional groups, the molecule could also interact with ion channels or transporters, which are encoded by genes like KCNH2 (potassium channel subfamily H member 2) and SLC6A4 (solute carrier family 6 member 4). These genes are involved in the regulation of ion fluxes and neurotransmitter reuptake, respectively.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis and the presence of specific functional groups, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes involved in neurotransmission, metabolism, and ion channel function, including but not limited to: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, and SLC6A4. Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, SLC6A4. Step 5: Based on the structural analysis and the presence of specific functional groups, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes involved in neurotransmission, metabolism, and ion channel function, including but not limited to: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, H
