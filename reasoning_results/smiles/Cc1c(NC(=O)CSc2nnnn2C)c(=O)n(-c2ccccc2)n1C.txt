Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1c(NC(=O)CSc2nnnn2C)c(=O)n(-c2ccccc2)n1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with several functional groups including an amide (N-C=O), a benzene ring, and a heterocyclic structure (cyclopropyl group). This structure suggests potential interactions with receptors or enzymes that have binding sites for similar chemical moieties.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (N-C=O) indicates that the molecule could interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize various drugs through oxidation reactions involving amides.
Step 3: The benzene ring in the molecule might enable it to bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), HTR1A (serotonin receptor 1A), HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A), and HRH1 (histamine receptor H1), which all have aromatic binding pockets.
Step 4: The cyclopropyl group present in the molecule could potentially form hydrogen bonds or other interactions with proteins like KCNH2 (potassium channel subfamily H member 2), which has a hydrophilic cavity that might accommodate such groups.
Step 5: Given the structural features, the most likely related genes from the provided list are: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HRH1, and KCNH2.
