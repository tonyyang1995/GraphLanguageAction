Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NC(=O)N1c2ccccc2CCc2ccccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string NC(=O)N1c2ccccc2CCc2ccccc21 represents a molecule that includes a pyrrolidine ring, an amide group (-CONH-), and a benzene ring. This structure is indicative of a small organic molecule with potential pharmacological activity.
Step 2: Analyzing the structure for potential interaction sites, the amide group could be a site for binding to proteins such as enzymes or receptors, which are often targets for drugs. The benzene ring may also contribute to interactions with aromatic residues in protein binding sites.
Step 3: Considering the gene list provided, several genes encode proteins involved in neurotransmitter signaling (e.g., HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) or receptors (e.g., CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, ADRB2). Given the presence of an amide and a benzene ring, this molecule might interact with these types of proteins.
Step 4: Additionally, some genes encode enzymes involved in drug metabolism (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) which could metabolize this molecule. The presence of an amide and benzene ring is common in substrates for these enzymes.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule could potentially interact with or be metabolized by the following genes: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, ADRB2, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. These genes are primarily associated with neurotransmitter receptors and drug-metabolizing enzymes.
