Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cccc(CNC(=O)C2CC[NH+](Cc3cnn(-c4ccccc4)c3-n3cccc3)CC2)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with a quinoline-like structure attached to it, featuring an amide group (N-C=O). This suggests potential interactions with enzymes that metabolize drugs or other small molecules, such as CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs.
Step 2: Additionally, the presence of a nitrogen atom with positive charge (N+) indicates potential interactions with receptors or transporters that have positively charged binding sites, such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and opioid receptors (OPRK1), which often bind to ligands with basic functional groups.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a pyrrolidine ring, which could interact with proteins containing acidic residues, like ion channels (KCNH2) or receptors (HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Step 4: Furthermore, the presence of aromatic rings and heterocycles may indicate potential interactions with kinases (LCK, MCL1) and G-protein coupled receptors (HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and functional groups present, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, OPRK1, KCNH2, LCK, MCL1, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6. Step 5: Related Gene Names:
