Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC1=CC(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a benzene ring with a ketone group (C=O) attached to one side and a cyano group (C#N) attached to the opposite side. This structure is commonly found in molecules that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are membrane proteins that play a role in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of the cyano group (C#N) is particularly noteworthy as it is known to be an activating substituent for GPCR ligands, enhancing their affinity for the receptor. This feature suggests that the molecule may bind to and activate certain GPCRs.
Step 3: Considering the gene list provided, several genes encode for GPCRs. These include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. The molecule's structure aligns well with the activation of these receptors.
Step 4: The specific pattern of the molecule, including the benzene ring and the cyano group, could potentially interact with the transmembrane domains of these GPCRs, leading to activation of the intracellular signaling cascade.
Step 5: Based on the structure and the interaction potential with GPCRs, the related genes in this context are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
