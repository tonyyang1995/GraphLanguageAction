Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccccc1N1CC[NH+](C(=O)c2cc3c(s2)CCC3)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a benzene ring with multiple substituents, including a nitrogen atom with a positive charge and a cyano group (-CN). This structure suggests that the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors that interact with these functional groups.
Step 2: Among the provided genes, several are known to encode for enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. These enzymes belong to the cytochrome P450 family and are responsible for metabolizing various drugs and xenobiotics. The presence of a benzene ring and a cyano group in the molecule might make it a potential substrate or inhibitor for these enzymes.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule contains a quinoline-like structure (quinoline is a common pharmacophore in many drugs). Genes like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which encode for dopamine receptors, could be affected by this structure. Dopamine receptors are involved in various physiological processes, including reward, motivation, and movement, and their modulation can lead to therapeutic effects in conditions such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia.
Step 4: Furthermore, the presence of a benzene ring and a positively charged nitrogen atom might suggest interactions with ion channels. Genes such as KCNH2, which encodes for the hERG potassium channel, could be influenced by the molecule due to its structural similarity to known channel inhibitors.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis of the molecule and the potential interactions with enzyme and receptor targets, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, and KCNH2.
