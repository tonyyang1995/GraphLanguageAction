Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])CCCc1ccc(N(CCCl)CCCl)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring system and an aromatic amide group, which are characteristic features of many drugs that interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This suggests potential interaction with genes encoding for GPCRs.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrophenyl group and a chloride substituent indicates that the molecule could be an inhibitor or activator of ion channels or transporters. This is relevant to genes involved in ion channel function and drug metabolism.
Step 3: The complex aromatic structure with multiple substituents, including a benzene ring and various alkyl chains, is typical of molecules that can act as agonists or antagonists of receptors, particularly GPCRs. This aligns with genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which encode for various subtypes of GPCRs.
Step 4: Given the presence of a carbonyl group and a carboxylic acid, this molecule may also have properties related to kinase inhibitors or modulators, which could be associated with genes such as CDK2 and LCK, both of which are involved in cell cycle regulation and signaling pathways.
Step 5: Considering the overall complexity and the presence of functional groups that can interact with proteins, this molecule is likely to have interactions with multiple genes, but the primary focus should be on those involved in GPCR function and ion channel modulation. The related gene names include:
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- ADRB2
- HRH1
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- CDK2
- LCK Step 5: Summary of Related Genes:
- LCK
These genes are primarily involved in GPCR function, ion channel modulation, and drug metabolism.
