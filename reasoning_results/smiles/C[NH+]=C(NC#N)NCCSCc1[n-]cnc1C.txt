Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+]=C(NC#N)NCCSCc1[n-]cnc1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups including an amide, a nitrile, and a carboxylic acid. Notably, it contains a pyrrolidine ring and a pyridine ring, which are common in many bioactive molecules.
Step 2: Analyzing the structure further, we see that the molecule has a quaternary ammonium salt (N+) moiety, suggesting potential proton donation and basicity. This could indicate that the molecule might interact with acidic sites on proteins, possibly affecting ion channels or receptors.
Step 3: The presence of a nitrile group (-CN) suggests that the molecule could be metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are known to oxidize nitriles. This implies a possible pharmacokinetic interaction with these enzymes.
Step 4: Given the presence of a carboxylic acid group, the molecule could also interact with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those encoded by PTGS1 (cyclooxygenase), which plays a role in prostaglandin synthesis. Additionally, the molecule might bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to its overall shape and functional groups, potentially interacting with HTR2A (serotonin receptor).
Step 5: Considering the above interactions, the molecule may be related to several genes involved in drug metabolism and receptor signaling, including CYP2C9, CYP2C19, PTGS1, HTR2A, and others listed such as CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and HTR2B.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- PTGS1
- HTR2A
- CYP3A4
- CYP2D6
- HTR2B
Note: Other genes like ABL1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, etc., do not have a direct structural or functional relationship based on the provided information about the molecule's structure. Therefore, they are not considered related to this particular molecule.
