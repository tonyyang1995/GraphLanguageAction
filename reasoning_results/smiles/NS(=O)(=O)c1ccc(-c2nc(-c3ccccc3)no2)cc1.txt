Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this information might be useful.
Step 1: The molecule has a nitro-sulfonamide (NS(=O)(=O)) functional group and a benzene ring system, which are characteristic features of certain drug molecules that interact with various receptors and transporters.
Step 2: The benzene ring and substituents suggest potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly those involved in neurotransmission, due to the presence of aromatic rings and amine groups.
Step 3: The molecule's structure includes a pyridine ring, which is known to bind to several GPCRs and enzymes, including those encoded by DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are dopamine receptors.
Step 4: The presence of a nitrogen atom and hydroxyl groups indicates possible binding to enzymes like CYP2D6, which metabolizes many drugs, and SLC6A4, a sodium-dependent neurotransmitter transporter.
Step 5: Given the structural features and potential binding sites, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2D6, SLC6A4.
Summary of related genes: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2D6, SLC6A4. Step 1: The molecule contains a nitro-sulfonamide (NS(=O)(=O)) group and a benzene ring system, which are common in drugs that interact with various biological targets.
