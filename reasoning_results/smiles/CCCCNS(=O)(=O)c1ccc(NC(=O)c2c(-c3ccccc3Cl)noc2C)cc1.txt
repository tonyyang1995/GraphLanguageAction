Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCNS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(NC(=O)c2c(-c3ccccc3Cl)noc2C)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex structure containing multiple functional groups such as amide (N=O), ester (O=C-O), aromatic rings (aromatic carbons), and a chloride atom. The presence of an amide group suggests that the molecule could be involved in interactions with proteins that have amide-binding sites, such as enzymes.
Step 2: The ester group indicates potential hydrolysis reactions which might influence the metabolism and stability of the molecule. This could relate to enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 3: The presence of aromatic rings and a chloride atom suggests the molecule could interact with ion channels or transporters. For example, CACNA1H encodes a calcium channel, and SLC6A4 encodes a neurotransmitter transporter, both of which could potentially interact with this molecule.
Step 4: Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, the molecule may also interact with receptors, particularly G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This could relate to genes such as HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and CHRM1, which encode serotonin and muscarinic receptors, respectively.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and the potential for interactions with enzymes, transporters, and receptors, the most likely related genes are: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CACNA1H, SLC6A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and CHRM1.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CACNA1H, SLC6A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CHRM1.
