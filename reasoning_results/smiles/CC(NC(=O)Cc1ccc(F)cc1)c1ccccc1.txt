Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(NC(=O)Cc1ccc(F)cc1)c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this information might be useful.
Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring system, a pyrrolidine ring, and a carboxamide group (-CONH-). These structural features suggest it may interact with proteins involved in cellular signaling and transport processes.
Step 2: The presence of a fluorine atom (F) in the molecule indicates potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for halogenated compounds, which could include some G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The carboxamide group (-CONH-) is a common functional group in molecules that bind to enzymes and receptors, particularly those involved in signal transduction pathways and neurotransmission.
Step 4: Given the molecular structure and functional groups, the molecule may interact with genes encoding proteins such as GPCRs, enzymes, and transporters. This includes genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and HTR2A.
Step 5: Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, HTR2A.
Summary of related genes:
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- ABL1
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
- HTR2A Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring system, a pyrrolidine ring, and a carboxamide group (-CONH-). These structural features suggest it may interact with proteins involved in cellular signaling and transport processes.
Step 5: Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, HTR2A. 
- HTR2A
Note: The summary of related genes has been repeated from Step 4 to ensure clarity and completeness. In practice, the summary would be provided once after the reasoning steps. The related genes are listed based on the molecule's structure and potential interactions.
