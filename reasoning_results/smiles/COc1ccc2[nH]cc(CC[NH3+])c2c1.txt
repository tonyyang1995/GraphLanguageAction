Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc2[nH]cc(CC[NH3+])c2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring system (COc1ccc2[nH]cc(CC[NH3+])c2c1), which is characterized by a five-membered heterocyclic ring with nitrogen atoms. This structural feature suggests potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for aromatic or heterocyclic compounds.
Step 2: The presence of a quaternary ammonium group (-NH3+) indicates the molecule could be an agonist or inhibitor of receptors that recognize positively charged molecules, such as certain ion channels or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: Given the molecule's structure and the presence of a quaternary ammonium group, it may interact with genes encoding for GPCRs or ion channels, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and KCNH2.
Step 4: The molecule's aromatic nature and the presence of a quaternary ammonium group also suggest potential interaction with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions with various receptors and enzymes, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Summary of related gene names:
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- ADRB2
- HRH1
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- HTR6

Note: The other genes listed do not have a direct relationship with the molecule based on its structure and properties. Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring system (COc1ccc2[nH]cc(CC[NH3+])c2c1), which is characterized by a five-membered heterocyclic ring with nitrogen atoms. This structural feature suggests potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for aromatic or heterocyclic compounds.
Step 4: The molecule's aromatic nature and the presence of a quaternary ammonium group also suggest potential interaction with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and C
