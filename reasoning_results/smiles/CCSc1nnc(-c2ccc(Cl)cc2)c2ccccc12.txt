Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCSc1nnc(-c2ccc(Cl)cc2)c2ccccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound with a structure that includes aromatic rings, a benzene ring, and several substituents such as chlorine and methyl groups. The presence of these functional groups suggests potential interactions with proteins or receptors involved in signaling pathways.
Step 2: The molecular structure contains a tricyclic core with a fused benzene ring system, which is characteristic of molecules that can interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are known to be involved in various physiological processes and are often targets for drugs due to their role in signal transduction.
Step 3: The substituents, particularly the chlorine atom, can act as lipophilic moieties, allowing the molecule to penetrate cell membranes and potentially bind to intracellular targets. This property is relevant to genes encoding membrane transporters and receptors.
Step 4: Given the potential for interaction with GPCRs and the presence of substituents that could modulate receptor activity, this molecule might be related to genes encoding GPCRs such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are all involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule’s ability to interact with membrane proteins and its structural complexity suggest it could also be related to other genes involved in cellular signaling and response mechanisms, such as PTGS1 (encoding cyclooxygenase-1), CYP2C9, and CYP2C19, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Summary of related gene names:
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- ADRB2
- CHRM1
- CHRM3
- CHRM4
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- HTR6
- PTGS1
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
The molecule's structure and properties suggest potential interactions with these genes, particularly those involved in GPCR signaling and drug metabolism. However, without experimental validation, these relationships are speculative based on the molecular structure alone.
