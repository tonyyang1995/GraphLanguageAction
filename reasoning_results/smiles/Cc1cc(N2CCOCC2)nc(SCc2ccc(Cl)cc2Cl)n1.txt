Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc(N2CCOCC2)nc(SCc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl)n1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule has a complex structure that includes a nitrogen atom within a ring system, suggesting it could be an amine or amide compound. It also contains several functional groups such as a carboxylic acid (COOH), a hydroxyl group (OH), and a sulfonyl group (SO2). These functional groups are often found in ligands that interact with receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The molecule’s presence of a carboxylic acid group (COOH) indicates it might act as a potential ligand for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or other receptors that bind negatively charged molecules. This is particularly relevant for genes encoding GPCRs like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 3: The sulfonyl group (SO2) present in the molecule could indicate the possibility of interaction with enzymes or receptors involved in metabolic pathways. CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) are known to metabolize various compounds, including drugs and xenobiotics, which might have interactions with this molecule.
Step 4: Given the presence of a nitrogen atom and the overall complexity of the molecule, there is a possibility that it could interact with ion channels or transporters. SLC6A2, SLC6A4, and KCNH2 could be relevant here due to their roles in neurotransmitter transport and ion channel function.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and functional groups, the molecule might also interact with enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways, such as kinases. LCK, which encodes a tyrosine kinase, and PTGS1 (which codes for cyclooxygenase-1) are potential targets based on the molecular features of the compound.
Summary of related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, KCNH2, LCK, PTGS1.
