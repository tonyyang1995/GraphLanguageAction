Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC1(O)c2ccccc2C(=O)[NH+]1CCc1ccccc1F, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring system, an amide group, and a pyrrolidine ring. The presence of an amide group suggests it could be an acetylcholine receptor antagonist or modulator due to its similarity to the structure of acetylcholine. This indicates potential interaction with cholinergic receptors.
Step 2: The presence of the pyrrolidine ring and the amide group also suggest that this molecule might interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly those involved in neurotransmission such as dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) and serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Step 3: Given the presence of a benzene ring and the overall structure, the molecule could potentially inhibit enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize a variety of drugs including some that interact with neurotransmitter systems.
Step 4: The fluorine atom attached to the benzene ring could contribute to the molecule’s ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, allowing it to reach targets within the central nervous system where it may affect neurotransmitter systems and receptors.
Step 5: Based on the structural features described, the most likely related genes would be those involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism, specifically: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C19, CYP2D6.
Summary of Related Genes: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C19, CYP2D6.
