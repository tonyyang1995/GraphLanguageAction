Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [O-]c1c(N=Nc2ccccn2)ccc2ccccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with a nitroso group (-N=N-) attached to a benzene ring, which is further connected to an oxygen atom carrying a negative charge (-O-). This structure suggests that the molecule might be involved in interactions with proteins that bind to aromatic compounds or have functional groups like nitroso or charged atoms.
Step 2: The presence of a nitroso group (-N=N-) in the molecule indicates potential redox activity, which could interact with enzymes or receptors involved in signal transduction pathways. This feature points towards the involvement of genes encoding enzymes such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) family members, which are known to metabolize drugs and xenobiotics, including those containing nitroso groups.
Step 3: The negative charge on the oxygen atom (-O-) in the molecule might allow it to interact with positively charged residues on proteins. This characteristic is relevant to genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), which typically have binding sites for negatively charged ligands.
Step 4: Given the complexity of the molecule, its potential interactions could extend to other genes involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways, such as dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), and other receptors like the opioid receptor (OPRK1).
Step 5: Based on the structural features and potential interaction patterns, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, OPRK1. 
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP family genes
- Adrenergic receptors
- Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors
- Dopamine receptors
- Serotonin receptors
- Opioid receptor
These genes are likely to be involved in the biological pathways affected by the molecule due to its structural characteristics and potential interactions.
