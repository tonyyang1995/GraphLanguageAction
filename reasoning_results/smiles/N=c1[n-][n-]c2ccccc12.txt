Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The SMILES string N=c1[n-][n-]c2ccccc12 represents a molecule that contains a nitrogen atom double-bonded to a carbon atom (N=c1), which is part of an aromatic ring system (c1[n-][n-]c2ccccc12). This structure suggests the presence of a heterocyclic compound, specifically an imidazole or pyrimidine derivative.
Step 2: The molecule’s negative nitrogen atoms ([n-]) indicate the presence of negatively charged groups, which could be relevant for interactions with positively charged regions on proteins. This feature might be important for binding to ion channels or receptors with positively charged residues.
Step 3: The aromatic ring system in the molecule could interact with various protein targets, particularly those involved in signal transduction pathways, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or ion channels. These interactions are often mediated through hydrophobic or electrostatic interactions.
Step 4: Considering the potential interactions with proteins, the molecule might be related to genes encoding for neurotransmitter receptors or ion channels. For example, genes like HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 encode for serotonin receptors, while CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4 encode for muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.
Step 5: Given the structure and potential interactions, the molecule could also be related to genes involved in the metabolism and regulation of neurotransmitters, such as CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs and other compounds.
