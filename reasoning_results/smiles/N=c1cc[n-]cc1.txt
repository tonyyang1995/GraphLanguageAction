Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N=c1cc[n-]cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The SMILES string N=c1cc[n-]cc1 represents a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compound with a substituted aziridine ring. This structure suggests the molecule could be an amine or amide derivative, which might interact with proteins that bind or modify such functional groups.
Step 2: Given the presence of a nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring and a negative charge on the nitrogen, this molecule may act as a ligand for receptors that recognize basic or charged amino acid residues. This structural feature aligns well with the characteristics of several G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) listed among the genes provided, such as DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), DRD3 (Dopamine receptor D3), DRD4 (Dopamine receptor D4), HTR1A (Serotonin receptor 1A), HTR2A (Serotonin receptor 2A), HTR2B (Serotonin receptor 2B), HTR2C (Serotonin receptor 2C), and HTR6 (Serotonin receptor 6).
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of an aziridine ring could potentially interact with enzymes or transporters involved in drug metabolism or neurotransmitter reuptake, such as CYP2C9 (Cytochrome P450 2C9), CYP2C19 (Cytochrome P450 2C19), CYP2D6 (Cytochrome P450 2D6), CYP3A4 (Cytochrome P450 3A4), and SLC6A4 (Solute Carrier Family 6 Member 4, also known as the serotonin transporter).
Step 4: The molecule’s basic nature and its ability to form hydrogen bonds due to the nitrogen atom could also make it a potential ligand for ion channels, such as KCNH2 (Potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2), which is a component of cardiac potassium channels.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecules could have interactions with the following genes: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and SLC6A4. These genes are associated with various neurological functions, drug metabolism, and neurotransmission processes.
