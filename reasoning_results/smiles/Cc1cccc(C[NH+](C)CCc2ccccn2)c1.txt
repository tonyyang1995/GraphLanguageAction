Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cccc(C[NH+](C)CCc2ccccn2)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a tricyclic core structure with an amine group, which is characteristic of certain types of ligands that can interact with receptors such as adrenergic and muscarinic receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (N+) suggests the molecule could be a partial agonist or antagonist for certain receptors, particularly those that bind positively charged ligands.
Step 3: The molecule's structure includes substituents like phenyl groups and a pyrrolidine ring, which are common in compounds that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 4: Given the structural features, this molecule might interact with GPCRs such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4, which are all GPCRs involved in neurotransmission and hormone signaling.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule's structure may also relate to enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, which metabolize many drugs including those acting on the above GPCRs.
