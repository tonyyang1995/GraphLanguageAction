Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(Cl)cc1NC(=O)CN(c1ccccc1)S(=O)(=O)[NH+](C)C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure including a benzene ring system, a pyridine ring, and several substituents such as chlorine, a carboxamide group, and a sulfonate ester. This type of molecular structure is often found in drugs that interact with receptors or transporters.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group (N=C=O) suggests the molecule could be an inhibitor or agonist of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are involved in various signaling pathways and are targets for many drugs. GPCRs are known to interact with neurotransmitters and other signaling molecules.
Step 3: The sulfonate ester (-SO3-) group in the molecule indicates it might have affinity for enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). These enzymes are crucial for the biotransformation of drugs and can affect their efficacy and toxicity.
Step 4: Given the pattern of substituents and the overall structure, this molecule may also interact with ion channels or receptors that modulate neuronal activity, such as those targeted by HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A), HTR2B (serotonin receptor 2B), and HRH1 (histamine receptor H1).
Step 5: Considering the potential interactions with metabolic enzymes and receptors involved in neurotransmission, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1. 
Summary of related genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1.
