Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)[NH2+]CC(O)COc1cccc2ccccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system (indicated by the 'C' characters) and a nitrogen atom with a positive charge ('[NH2+]'), which suggests it may be an amine-based compound. This structural feature could potentially interact with proteins that have binding sites for basic amino groups, such as receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of an oxygen atom double-bonded to a carbon atom ('C(O)') indicates a carbonyl group, which is common in drugs that target protein kinases or receptors involved in signal transduction pathways. This feature might suggest a relationship with genes encoding proteins that contain such groups, such as kinases or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The molecule also includes a carboxylic acid group ('CO'), which is known to form hydrogen bonds and can act as a ligand for various proteins, including ion channels and receptors. This characteristic could imply a connection with genes encoding ion channels or receptors that interact with acidic ligands.
Step 4: Considering the specific structure and functional groups present in the molecule, it appears to be most closely related to genes that encode proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, neurotransmitter receptors, and ion channel function. This is because the molecule has features that are commonly found in drugs that modulate these processes.
Step 5: Based on the analysis, the genes most likely to be related to this molecule include those encoding GPCRs (such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), ion channels (like KCNH2, CACNA1H), and kinases (like CDK2, LCK). Additionally, genes involved in signal transduction pathways and neurotransmission, such as PTGS1, ESR1, and CYP enzymes, could also be relevant due to their roles in metabolizing or interacting with the molecule.
