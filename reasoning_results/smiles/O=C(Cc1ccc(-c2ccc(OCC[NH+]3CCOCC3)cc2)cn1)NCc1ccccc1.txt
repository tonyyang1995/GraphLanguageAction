Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule is a complex organic compound with a structure that includes a benzene ring fused to a pyridine ring, connected through a carbonyl group (C=O). This structure is indicative of a quinolone-like compound, which often has pharmacological activity.
Step 2: The molecule also contains a heterocyclic amine moiety (-N+) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which are common functional groups in many bioactive molecules. These functional groups can interact with various proteins and enzymes, potentially affecting their activity.
Step 3: Considering the presence of a carboxylic acid group and the overall structure, this molecule could interact with membrane receptors or ion channels. For instance, it might bind to adrenergic receptors (such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) or dopaminergic receptors (such as DRD2, DRD3, DRD4).
Step 4: The molecule’s structure also suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize many drugs.
Step 5: Given the interaction possibilities with receptors and metabolic enzymes, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
