Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(-c2nc(N3CCOCC3)c3sc(CN(C)c4ncc(C(O)=NO)cn4)cc3n2)cn1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure that includes aromatic rings, heteroatoms such as nitrogen and oxygen, and functional groups like amides and esters. It also contains a cyclic nitro group (-N=O), which is a characteristic feature often found in drugs targeting various receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: Given the presence of a cyclic nitro group and the overall complexity of the molecule, it suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways and receptor activation. This is particularly relevant for genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes that are involved in neurotransmitter metabolism.
Step 3: Among the provided genes, several are known to be involved in neurotransmitter systems and signal transduction. These include HTR1A (5-HT1A receptor), HTR2A (serotonin 5-HT2A receptor), HTR2B (serotonin 5-HT2B receptor), HTR2C (serotonin 5-HT2C receptor), DRD2 (dopamine D2 receptor), DRD3 (dopamine D3 receptor), DRD4 (dopamine D4 receptor), CHRM1 (muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1), CHRM3 (muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3), and CHRM4 (muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M4).
Step 4: The molecule’s structure also indicates possible interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These cytochrome P450 enzymes play a crucial role in the metabolism of many drugs, including those that interact with the above-mentioned receptors.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and the potential for interaction with neurotransmitter receptors and drug-metabolizing enzymes, the related genes are likely to be: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These genes are central to the regulation of neurotransmitter signaling and drug metabolism, making them the most plausible targets for this molecule.
