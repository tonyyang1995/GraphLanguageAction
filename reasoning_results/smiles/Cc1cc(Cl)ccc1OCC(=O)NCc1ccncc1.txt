Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc(Cl)ccc1OCC(=O)NCc1ccncc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure including a benzene ring, a chlorine atom, an oxygen atom, and a nitro group (NO2). These features suggest that the molecule could be involved in interactions with enzymes or receptors that are known to interact with similar chemical moieties.
Step 2: Looking at the genes provided, those involved in drug metabolism like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 are potential candidates due to their role in metabolizing drugs with similar chemical structures. The presence of a nitro group and a benzene ring in the molecule aligns well with the substrate specificity of these cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Step 3: Additionally, genes involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 might also be relevant. The presence of an aromatic ring and hydroxyl groups in the molecule could interact with the ligand-binding domains of these receptors.
Step 4: Furthermore, genes associated with neurotransmitter systems, such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are dopamine receptors, could have a relationship with this molecule due to its possible ability to modulate neurotransmission through binding or affecting receptor function.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and the described relationships, the related genes are: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CNR1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, PPARG, PTGS1, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
