Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)(C)C(=O)C(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)n1ccnc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is a common feature in many drug molecules that interact with receptors and transport proteins. This suggests potential interactions with genes encoding for receptors and transporters.
Step 2: The molecule also has an amide group (-CONH-) and a carboxylate group (-COOH), which are functional groups often involved in binding to enzymes and receptors. This indicates possible interactions with genes encoding for enzymes and receptors.
Step 3: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the amide and the possibility of aromatic rings suggest the molecule could interact with genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels.
Step 4: Given the structural complexity and the presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocycle, the molecule may also interact with genes encoding for cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs), particularly CYP2D6 and CYP2C9, which metabolize many drugs.
Step 5: Based on the above structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to genes such as CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and CYP3A4.
Related genes: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CYP3A4.
