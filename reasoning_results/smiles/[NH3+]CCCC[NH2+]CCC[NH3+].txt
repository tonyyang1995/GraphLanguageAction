Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [NH3+]CCCC[NH2+]CCC[NH3+], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string [NH3+]CCCC[NH2+]CCC[NH3+] has a central carbon chain with amine (-NH2) and positively charged amino groups (-NH3+) attached to it. This structure suggests the molecule could interact with receptors that bind to amine-containing ligands, such as adrenergic and muscarinic receptors.
Step 2: The presence of positively charged amino groups indicates potential interactions with negatively charged sites on cell membranes or proteins, which might be relevant for the function of genes encoding ion channels or receptors that have binding sites for cationic compounds.
Step 3: The molecular structure does not directly suggest interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), as there are no obvious functional groups that would be substrates for these enzymes.
Step 4: Given the pattern of the molecule, it could potentially interact with receptors like those encoded by ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and DRD2, which are all involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways.
Step 5: The molecule may also be relevant to HRH1, as histamine receptors can be activated by certain amines, though this is less direct based on the given structure.
Summary of related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, HRH1. Step 1: The molecule has a central carbon chain with positively charged amino groups (-NH3+) and amine (-NH2) functionalities attached. This structure suggests potential interactions with biological molecules that bind to amines or positively charged groups.
Step 2: The presence of positively charged amino groups implies possible interactions with anionic sites on cell membranes or proteins, which could be relevant for genes encoding ion channels or receptors.
Step 3: The molecular structure does not directly indicate interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) due to the lack of typical substrate functional groups.
Step 4: Given the pattern of the molecule, it could interact with receptors such as those encoded by ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and DRD2, which are involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways.
Step 5: The molecule may also have relevance to HRH1, as histamine receptors can be activated by certain amines, though this is less direct based on the given structure.
