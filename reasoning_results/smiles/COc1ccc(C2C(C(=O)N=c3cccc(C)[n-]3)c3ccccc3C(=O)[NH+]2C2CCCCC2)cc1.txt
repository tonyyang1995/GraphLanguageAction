Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(C2C(C(=O)N=c3cccc(C)[n-]3)c3ccccc3C(=O)[NH+]2C2CCCCC2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a complex structure with multiple rings, including a benzene ring and a pyrrole ring. It also has several functional groups such as amide (-CONH), carboxyl (-COOH), and amino (-NH2) groups. These features suggest that the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors involved in neurotransmission, signal transduction, or metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of the carboxyl group and the amide group indicates potential interactions with enzymes that contain catalytic sites for esterases or amidases, such as CYP (Cytochrome P450) enzymes. CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics, which could be affected by this molecule due to its chemical structure.
Step 3: The molecule also has a quinolone-like structure, which might interact with receptors or ion channels. For instance, it could potentially affect G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2) and HTR2A (Serotonin receptor 5-HT2A). These receptors are involved in neurotransmission and are targets for several psychiatric medications.
Step 4: Given the presence of aromatic rings and heteroatoms (nitrogen and oxygen), the molecule may have affinity for ion channels, particularly voltage-gated sodium channels like KCNH2, which is involved in cardiac function and could be relevant to conditions like long QT syndrome.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and the presence of specific functional groups, the molecule could interact with enzymes or receptors involved in signal transduction pathways. Genes like EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) and PTGS1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase 1) could be relevant if the molecule affects cell signaling or inflammatory responses.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- DRD2
- HTR2A
- KCNH2
- EGFR
- PTGS1
Note: This summary focuses on the most likely interactions based on the molecule's structure. The actual biological activity would need to be experimentally verified. Step 1: The molecule contains a complex structure with multiple rings, indicating it could interact with enzymes or receptors involved in various biological processes.
Step 2: The presence of carboxyl and amide groups suggests potential interactions with enzymes like CYP (Cytochrome P450) enzymes, specifically CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 3: The molecule's structure, particularly the quinolone-like part, might interact with GPCRs such as DRD2 and HTR2A, which play roles in neurotransmission.
Step 4: Aromatic rings and heteroatoms (nitrogen and oxygen) indicate possible interaction with ion channels, such as KCNH2, affecting cardiac function.
Step 5: Overall structure points to potential effects on signal transduction pathways, possibly involving genes like EGFR and PTGS1.
