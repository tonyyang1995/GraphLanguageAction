Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound that contains several functional groups such as amide (N=C=O), ester (O=C-O), phenyl rings (C6H5), and a nitrogen atom with a negative charge (N-). This structure suggests the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors.
Step 2: Looking at the genes listed, several are known to encode for enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. These cytochrome P450 enzymes are responsible for metabolizing various drugs, including those with similar chemical structures to the given molecule.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule has a structure that could interact with receptors like adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), and serotonergic receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6). These receptors play crucial roles in neurotransmission and are often targeted by pharmaceuticals.
Step 4: The presence of an amide group in the molecule might also suggest its potential to act as a ligand for ion channels, such as KCNH2, which encodes for the hERG potassium channel, or voltage-gated calcium channels like CACNA1H.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and potential interactions, the genes related to this molecule include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and KCNH2.
