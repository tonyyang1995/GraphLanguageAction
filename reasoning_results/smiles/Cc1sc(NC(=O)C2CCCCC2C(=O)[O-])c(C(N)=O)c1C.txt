Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1sc(NC(=O)C2CCCCC2C(=O)[O-])c(C(N)=O)c1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring system, which is part of its core structure. This ring is typically involved in interactions with receptors that have hydrophobic binding pockets, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature suggests potential interaction with genes encoding for GPCRs.
Step 2: Among the provided genes, several are known to encode for GPCRs: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6. These receptors are involved in various physiological processes including neurotransmission and hormone signaling.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule includes an amide group (-CONH-) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which are common functional groups found in many ligands that interact with enzymes and transport proteins. Genes encoding for enzymes and transporters might be relevant, but among the listed genes, none directly correspond to these functions.
Step 4: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the amide group and the carboxylate group suggests the molecule could potentially inhibit or activate enzymes that contain catalytic sites with similar functional groups, like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in drug metabolism. However, no direct evidence indicates these specific interactions based on the provided information.
Step 5: Based on the analysis of the molecular structure and the provided genes, the molecule may have the strongest relationship with the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6. These genes encode for GPCRs, which are likely to be the primary targets for the molecule due to its hydrophobic core and functional groups that can interact with receptor binding sites.
