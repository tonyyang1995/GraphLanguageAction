Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cccc(C)c1NC(=O)C1CCCC[NH+]1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure that includes a benzene ring (Cc1cccc(C)c1), an amide group (-NC(=O)-), and a pyrrolidine ring. This structure suggests the molecule could be a drug-like compound or a small molecule with potential biological activity.
Step 2: The presence of the amide group (-NC(=O)-) and the benzene ring (Cc1cccc(C)c1) are characteristic of compounds that might interact with receptors or enzymes. Specifically, the amide group is often found in ligands for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other receptor types, while the benzene ring can serve as a scaffold for binding to various protein targets.
Step 3: Given the presence of the benzene ring and the amide group, this molecule could potentially interact with several genes involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways. For instance, the benzene ring could form part of a structure that binds to a GPCR, and the amide group could participate in hydrogen bonding interactions with the receptor's binding site.
Step 4: Among the provided genes, those related to GPCRs and neurotransmitter systems would be most likely to interact with this molecule. Genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 encode receptors for adrenergic and cholinergic neurotransmitters, as well as serotonin (5-HT).
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule's structure could also be relevant to other genes involved in signaling pathways or drug metabolism. Genes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are involved in the metabolism of many drugs, including those that interact with GPCRs. Therefore, this molecule might also have relevance to these genes.
