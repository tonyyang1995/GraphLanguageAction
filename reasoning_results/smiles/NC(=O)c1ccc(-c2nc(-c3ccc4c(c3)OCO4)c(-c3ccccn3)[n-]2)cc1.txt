Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NC(=O)c1ccc(-c2nc(-c3ccc4c(c3)OCO4)c(-c3ccccn3)[n-]2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring fused to an imidazole ring, which is part of a larger structure known as a pyrrolo[3,2-c]pyrimidine. This structural feature is commonly found in compounds that interact with the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), a class of membrane proteins involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) suggests the molecule could act as a ligand for various receptors, including those associated with the adrenergic and cholinergic systems. These groups are typical for molecules that bind to adrenergic (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and cholinergic (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4) receptors.
Step 3: The molecule also has a quinolone-like structure, which is known to interact with certain enzymes like CYP2D6 and CYP2C9, indicating potential metabolic interactions with these cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Step 4: Given the presence of a benzene ring with a nitro group (-NO2), this could suggest the molecule might have affinity for receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmission, such as serotonin receptors (HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Step 5: The overall structure and functional groups of the molecule indicate it may be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6. Step 1: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
