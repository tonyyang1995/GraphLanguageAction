Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(NC1CC[NH+](Cc2ccccc2)CC1)c1cccc2ccccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups including an amide, a carboxylic acid, and several aromatic rings. This indicates it likely interacts with proteins that have binding sites for these functional groups.
Step 2: One of the key functional groups in the molecule is the amide group (-CONH-), which suggests the molecule may interact with enzymes or receptors that have amide-binding pockets. Additionally, the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) could indicate potential interactions with ion channels or transporters that have acidic residue binding sites.
Step 3: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom that is part of a heterocyclic ring (likely pyrrolidine or similar). This type of nitrogen-containing ring can be recognized by receptors or enzymes that have specific binding pockets for such structures.
Step 4: Given the complexity and the presence of various functional groups, this molecule might interact with a range of proteins, but the primary focus would be on those involved in signaling pathways, drug metabolism, and neurotransmission, given the presence of amide and carboxylic acid groups.
Step 5: Based on the above structural features, the molecule could potentially interact with genes encoding proteins involved in G-protein coupled receptor signaling (e.g., CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1), enzymes involved in drug metabolism (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), and receptors involved in neurotransmission (e.g., HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C).
