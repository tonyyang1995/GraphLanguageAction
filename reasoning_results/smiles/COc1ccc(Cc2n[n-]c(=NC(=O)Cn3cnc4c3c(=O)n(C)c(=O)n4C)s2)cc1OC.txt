Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(Cc2n[n-]c(=NC(=O)Cn3cnc4c3c(=O)n(C)c(=O)n4C)s2)cc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex molecule with a core structure that includes a benzene ring system, a pyridine ring, and several functional groups such as amide, ester, and nitro groups. The presence of these functional groups suggests that the molecule could interact with proteins involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and enzyme activity.
Step 2: The molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) and an amide (-CONH-) linkage, which are common in ligands for receptors and enzymes. Specifically, the nitro group can act as a modulator for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), while the amide group can participate in hydrogen bonding and form part of the binding site for enzymes like cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms.
Step 3: Given the presence of these functional groups and the overall structure, the molecule might interact with genes encoding proteins that are known to be targets for drugs containing similar functional groups. For instance, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 are enzymes involved in drug metabolism and could potentially interact with this molecule due to its amide and possibly its nitro functionality.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of an amide and ester group could indicate potential interactions with other genes encoding receptors, such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are serotonin receptors. These receptors often have binding sites that include amide and ester functionalities.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the genes related to this molecule include those encoding enzymes involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and receptors that may bind to molecules with amide and ester functionalities (HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C).
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP1A2
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
These genes encode proteins that could interact with the described molecular structure based on their known binding sites and functional roles.
