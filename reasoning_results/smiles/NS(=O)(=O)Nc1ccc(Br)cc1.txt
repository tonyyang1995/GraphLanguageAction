Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NS(=O)(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a structure that includes a nitroso group (NS(=O)(=O)) and a benzene ring substituted with a bromine atom (Br). This structure suggests the molecule may be a derivative of an aromatic compound containing a nitroso group.
Step 2: Considering the pattern of the molecule, it resembles certain drug classes such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which often contain a benzene ring and functional groups like nitroso. These compounds are known to interact with various enzymes and receptors involved in pain and inflammation pathways.
Step 3: Among the provided genes, several are associated with neurotransmitter systems and receptors. Notably, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 encode serotonin receptors, which are targets for many NSAIDs due to their role in modulating pain and mood.
Step 4: Additionally, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 are cytochrome P450 enzymes that metabolize many drugs, including NSAIDs. These enzymes could play a role in the metabolism of the given molecule, affecting its pharmacokinetics and efficacy.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes include: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19.
Summary of related gene names:
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- HTR6
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
These genes are involved in serotonin receptor function and drug metabolism, respectively, which are relevant to the molecule's potential biological activities.
