Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(NCCO[N+](=O)[O-])c1cccnc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a structure that includes a pyrrole ring system (indicated by the 'n' notation in the SMILES string) and a pyridine ring system, which are common in many drugs and small molecules. These types of ring systems often interact with proteins involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways, which are mediated by various receptors encoded by the genes listed.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH-) and an amide group (-CONR-) suggests the molecule could be a ligand for enzymes or receptors that bind such functional groups. This is particularly relevant for genes encoding enzymes like CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs, including those that might contain these functional groups.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a nitrile group (-CN), which can interact with metal ions and form hydrogen bonds, potentially affecting the activity of ion channels or other proteins. Genes such as KCNH2 (encoding the hERG potassium channel) and HTR2A (encoding the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor) might be influenced by this feature.
Step 4: Given the complexity of the molecule and its potential to interact with multiple targets, it is likely to have effects on several genes. However, based on the structure, it is more plausible that the molecule interacts with genes involved in drug metabolism (CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19) and those encoding receptors or ion channels (HTR2A, KCNH2).
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the following genes are most likely to be related to the molecule due to their potential interactions based on the molecule's structure: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, HTR2A, and KCNH2. 
Summary of Related Genes:
- CYP2D6

- CYP2C19
- HTR2A
- KCNH2 Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the following genes are most likely to be related to the molecule due to their potential interactions based on the molecule's structure: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, HTR2A, and KCNH2. 
- KCNH2
This summary focuses on the most plausible interactions based on the molecule's structural features. The related genes are primarily involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmitter signaling.
