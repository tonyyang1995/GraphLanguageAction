Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(CCn1c(=O)sc2ccccc21)N=c1[n-]c2ccccc2s1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring system, which is characteristic of many ligands that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature suggests potential interaction with genes encoding GPCRs.
Step 2: The presence of an imidazole ring and a phenyl ring in the molecule indicates it could be a ligand for receptors like D2 dopamine receptors (DRD2), which are known to have imidazole binding sites.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a quinoline-like structure, which might interact with CYP enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2D6 and CYP3A4.
Step 4: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in the molecule could suggest potential interactions with genes involved in inflammatory responses, such as PTGS1, but this is less direct compared to the GPCR and CYP interactions.
Step 5: Given the above structural features, the molecule is likely to be related to DRD2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and PTGS1.
Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
