Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CSc1nn2c(C)cc(C)nc2c1S(=O)(=O)c1cccc(F)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with a sulfonamide group and multiple substituents, suggesting it could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and a sulfonamide group is characteristic of drugs that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Step 3: The molecule's structure aligns with known inhibitors of CYP2D6, a member of the cytochrome P450 family, which is involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: Given the potential interaction with CYP2D6, the molecule may also influence other CYP enzymes such as CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, which are also listed among the provided genes.
Step 5: The molecule's structure suggests possible interactions with GPCRs, specifically DRD2 and HTR2A, both of which are listed among the provided genes.
