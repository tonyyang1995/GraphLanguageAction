Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(N=c2cc(C(=O)NCCC[NH+]3CC[NH+](C)CC3)c3ccccc3[n-]2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule contains several functional groups such as amide (N=C), imine (N=), aromatic rings (c-c-c), and a quaternary ammonium group ([NH+]). These structural features suggest the molecule could interact with proteins that have binding sites for these types of chemical functionalities.
Step 2: Among the listed genes, those involved in neurotransmitter receptors and transporters are particularly relevant due to their binding sites for small molecules and their involvement in signal transduction pathways. Genes like DRD2 (Dopamine Receptor D2), HTR2A (Serotonin Receptor 2A), and SLC6A4 (Solute Carrier Family 6 Member 4) encode proteins that directly interact with neurotransmitters and small molecules.
Step 3: The molecule’s presence of an imine and quaternary ammonium group indicates it might bind to proteins that have corresponding binding sites, which could include G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This makes genes encoding for GPCRs such as ADRA1D (Adrenergic Receptor Alpha 1D) and ADRA2B (Adrenergic Receptor Alpha 2B) potentially relevant.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule’s structure may allow it to interact with enzymes that metabolize drugs or neurotransmitters, such as CYP2D6 (Cytochrome P450 2D6) and CYP2C19 (Cytochrome P450 2C19), which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and potential interactions described, the related genes are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, SLC6A2, SLC6A4. 
Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
