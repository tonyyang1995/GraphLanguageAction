Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CSC(N)=[NH2+], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string CSC(N)=[NH2+] contains a nitrogen atom double-bonded to a carbon atom and a positively charged amino group. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins that have similar functional groups or binding sites.
Step 2: The positively charged amino group could interact with negatively charged residues on protein surfaces, which might be relevant to genes encoding ion channels or receptors involved in neurotransmission. For example, this could potentially affect genes like HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, all of which encode serotonin receptor subtypes.
Step 3: The presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (cyclohexane-1,3-dione) in the molecule could also suggest interactions with enzymes or receptors that bind to such structures. Genes CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which encode cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in drug metabolism, are potential candidates for interaction.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule’s basic nature due to the amino group could lead to interactions with acidic residues in proteins, which might be relevant to genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, all of which encode dopamine receptor subtypes.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes include: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
