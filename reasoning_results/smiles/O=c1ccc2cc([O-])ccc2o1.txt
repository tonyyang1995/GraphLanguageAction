Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1ccc2cc([O-])ccc2o1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a tricyclic compound containing a central carbon atom double-bonded to a nitrogen (N), which is part of a pyrrole ring, and two phenyl rings attached to the other sides. This structure is reminiscent of molecules that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to their ability to fit into the receptor's binding pocket. 
Step 2: GPCRs are involved in signal transduction pathways and are known to be modulated by various ligands, including drugs. Among the listed genes, several are associated with GPCRs: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and HRH1.
Step 3: The molecule's aromatic nature and presence of an amine group (-NH2) suggest it could act as a ligand for receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and cholinergic receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4). Additionally, its potential to bind to serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) and histamine receptors (HRH1) is plausible given the chemical features.
Step 4: Furthermore, the presence of a nitrophenyl group in the molecule might contribute to its affinity for certain GPCRs, particularly those involved in signaling pathways that are modulated by such groups, like the 5-HT2A receptor (HTR2A).
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule may have interactions with the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and HRH1.
