Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc(C)[n-]c(=NC2=[NH+]CCS2)n1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound with a nitrogen atom bearing a positive charge, indicating it is likely an amine or aminium ion. This feature suggests the molecule could interact with proteins that have binding sites for positively charged molecules, such as ion channels or receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a sulfur atom in the molecule, particularly in the context of a thiocarbamate group (SC(N)N), points towards potential interactions with enzymes or proteins that contain thiol groups, which are common in cysteine residues. This could be relevant to enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are known to oxidize thiols.
Step 3: The presence of a nitrile (-CN) group and a carboxamide (-CONH2) group might indicate the molecule has properties similar to ligands that can bind to certain protein targets, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are involved in numerous physiological processes and are often targeted by drugs. This feature is particularly relevant to genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode for various subtypes of GPCRs.
Step 4: The presence of a benzene ring and a phenyl group could suggest the molecule has aromaticity, which may enable it to form hydrogen bonds or π-π stacking interactions with other molecules, potentially affecting the activity of enzymes or receptors. This is relevant to genes encoding enzymes that process aromatic compounds, such as CYP1A2 and CYP2D6.
Step 5: The overall structure of the molecule, with its diverse functional groups, indicates it could be a versatile molecule capable of interacting with multiple targets. This versatility is particularly relevant to genes involved in drug metabolism and transport, such as ABCB1, which encodes P-glycoprotein, a transmembrane transporter that can affect the bioavailability of drugs.
Summary of related gene names:
ABCB1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
The molecule appears to be related to several genes involved in drug metabolism, transport, and receptor function, given its chemical structure and potential interactions with biological targets. The specific genes listed above are those most likely to be influenced by this molecule based on the molecular features described. Step 1: The molecule contains a positively charged nitrogen atom, which suggests it might interact with negatively charged sites on proteins or ions, possibly influencing ion channels or receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a thiocarbamate group (-SC(N)N-) indicates the molecule could interact with thiol-containing proteins, which are common in enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4.
Step 3: The nitrile (-CN) and carboxamide (-CONH2) groups suggest the molecule could bind to G
