Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+](Cc1ccccc1)S(=O)(=O)c1ccc(NS(=O)(=O)Cc2ccccc2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge, indicated by [NH+], which suggests it has basic properties. This functional group is often involved in binding to proteins that have acidic or negatively charged regions, such as certain receptors or ion channels.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a thiosemicarbazone moiety (NS(=O)(=O)) attached to a benzene ring, which can form hydrogen bonds and interact with proteins containing amino acid residues that facilitate such interactions.
Step 3: The presence of multiple aromatic rings and double bonds in the molecule, particularly in the thiophene and benzene rings, indicates potential for π-π stacking interactions with proteins that contain aromatic amino acids, which are common in transmembrane domains of receptors and ion channels.
Step 4: Given the structural features identified, the molecule is likely to interact with proteins that have acidic, basic, and aromatic amino acid residues in their active sites or binding pockets, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule could be related to several genes encoding GPCRs and ion channels, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, PTGS1, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4. These genes encode proteins that are known to interact with ligands having similar chemical properties to the described molecule. 
Summary of related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, PTGS1, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
