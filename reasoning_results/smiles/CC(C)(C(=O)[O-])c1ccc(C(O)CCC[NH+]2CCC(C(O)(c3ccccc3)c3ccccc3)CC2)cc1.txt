Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)(C(=O)[O-])c1ccc(C(O)CCC[NH+]2CCC(C(O)(c3ccccc3)c3ccccc3)CC2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a quinoline ring system, which is characteristic of many drugs that interact with the cytochrome P450 enzyme family (CYP). This includes CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
Step 2: Additionally, the molecule has a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH), which is a common feature in substrates for CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 enzymes, further suggesting its interaction with these enzymes.
Step 3: The presence of a benzene ring with an amide group (C(=O)[O-]) indicates potential interactions with enzymes involved in the metabolism of amide-containing compounds, such as CYP3A4.
Step 4: The overall structure also suggests possible binding to receptors or ion channels, particularly those involved in neurotransmission, such as DRD2, HTR2A, and KCNH2.
Step 5: Considering the pharmacophoric features of the molecule, it is likely to interact with multiple genes involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmission, including CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, and KCNH2.
