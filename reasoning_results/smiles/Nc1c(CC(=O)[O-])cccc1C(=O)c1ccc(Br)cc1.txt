Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Nc1c(CC(=O)[O-])cccc1C(=O)c1ccc(Br)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing several functional groups including an amide (Nc1c(CC(=O)[O-])cccc1), a benzene ring (C(=O)c1ccc(Br)cc1), and a quinoline-like structure (Nc1c). The presence of an amide group suggests this molecule could be an inhibitor or activator of enzymes that interact with amides, such as certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs).
Step 2: The benzene ring with a bromine substituent (C(=O)c1ccc(Br)cc1) indicates the molecule has aromatic properties which can influence its binding to receptors or enzymes that recognize aromatic patterns, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or nuclear receptors.
Step 3: The quinoline-like structure (Nc1c) might indicate potential interactions with proteins that have quinoline-binding domains, such as certain ion channels (e.g., KCNH2) or transporters (e.g., SLC6A4).
Step 4: Given the functional groups and structural features identified, the molecule could potentially interact with genes involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), GPCR signaling pathways (HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HRH1, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), and ion channel regulation (KCNH2).
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and potential interactions, the related genes are: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HRH1, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and KCNH2.
