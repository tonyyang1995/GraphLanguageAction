Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)CC(=O)N=c1[n-][n-]c2c1C[NH+](C(=O)C1CC[NH+](C)CC1)C2(C)C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a benzene ring system, a carboxamide group (-CONH2), and a guanidino group (-NH-C(NH2)2). These structural features are characteristic of molecules that can interact with various receptors and ion channels.
Step 2: The presence of the carboxamide group suggests potential interaction with enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics. The guanidino group could also be relevant for interactions with certain G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The benzene ring system, along with the overall molecular structure, indicates that this compound might interact with receptors like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are dopamine receptors. These receptors are involved in neurotransmission and have been implicated in various neurological and psychiatric disorders.
Step 4: The molecule's structure may also suggest potential binding to adrenergic and cholinergic receptors due to its aromatic and amine groups, which are common in ligands for these types of receptors. This could relate to ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 5: Given the complexity of the molecule and its diverse functional groups, it is likely to have multiple points of interaction with different genes. However, based on the structural analysis, the most relevant genes appear to be those involved in neurotransmission and receptor signaling, such as DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
