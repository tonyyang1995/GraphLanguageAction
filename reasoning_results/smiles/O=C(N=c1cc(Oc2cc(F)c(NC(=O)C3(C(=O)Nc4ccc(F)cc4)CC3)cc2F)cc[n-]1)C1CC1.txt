Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(N=c1cc(Oc2cc(F)c(NC(=O)C3(C(=O)Nc4ccc(F)cc4)CC3)cc2F)cc[n-]1)C1CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this relationship might be clinically relevant.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is a common structural feature in many drugs that interact with receptors and transport proteins. This suggests potential interactions with genes encoding for such proteins.
Step 2: The presence of a pyridine ring (N=c1cc) and a quinoline-like structure (c1cc(Oc2cc(F)c(NC(=O)C3(C(=O)Nc4ccc(F)cc4)CC3)cc2F)) indicates the molecule may have pharmacological activity, possibly through interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The molecule also includes functional groups such as amides (NC(=O)C3), esters (C(=O)Nc4ccc(F)cc4), and carboxylic acids (O=C(N=), C1CC1). These groups are often found in molecules that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other membrane-bound receptors, suggesting possible interactions with genes encoding these receptors.
Step 4: The molecule's overall structure and functional groups suggest it could potentially interact with enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs.
Step 5: Given the potential for the molecule to interact with enzymes and receptors, the related genes include those encoding for drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and GPCRs (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HRH1, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4).
