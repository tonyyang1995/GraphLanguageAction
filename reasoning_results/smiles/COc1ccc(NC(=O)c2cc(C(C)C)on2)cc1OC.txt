Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(NC(=O)c2cc(C(C)C)on2)cc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with a nitro group (-NO2) attached to one of the rings. This structural feature is often involved in interactions with enzymes and receptors that play roles in drug metabolism and signaling.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) and an amide linkage (-CONH-) suggests potential binding to proteins involved in neurotransmission and receptor modulation, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The molecule also includes a thiazole ring, which is known to interact with certain enzyme families, including those involved in cytochrome P450 metabolism, particularly CYP2D6 and CYP2C9.
Step 4: Given the complexity of the molecule, it likely interacts with multiple targets, but the primary focus for gene relationships would be on enzymes and receptors that process or respond to similar functional groups.
Step 5: Genes related to this molecule include: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, and SLC6A4.
