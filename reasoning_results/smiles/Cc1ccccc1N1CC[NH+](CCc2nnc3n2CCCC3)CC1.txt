Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccccc1N1CC[NH+](CCc2nnc3n2CCCC3)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with multiple rings and functional groups including aromatic rings, nitrogen-containing heterocycles, and amide bonds. This structure suggests the molecule could have various biological activities depending on its specific interactions with proteins and receptors.
Step 2: Analyzing the pattern of the molecule, it contains a quinoline ring system (N1CC[NH+](CCc2nnc3n2CCCC3)), which is known to interact with certain G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are often targets for drugs that modulate neurotransmitter signaling pathways, and they are associated with several of the listed genes such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, all of which encode serotonin receptors.
Step 3: The presence of an imidazole group (N1CC[NH+]) in the molecule might indicate potential interactions with ion channels, particularly those containing histidine residues. Among the provided genes, KCNH2 encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel, which could be a target for this molecule due to its imidazole feature.
Step 4: Considering the overall complexity and the presence of amide and aromatic functionalities, the molecule may also interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are part of the cytochrome P450 family.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis and potential interaction sites, the molecule could be related to the following genes: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. These genes are involved in neurotransmission, ion channel regulation, and drug metabolism, respectively.
