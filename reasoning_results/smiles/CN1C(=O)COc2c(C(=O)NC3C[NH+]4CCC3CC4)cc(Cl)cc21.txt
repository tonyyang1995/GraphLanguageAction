Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CN1C(=O)COc2c(C(=O)NC3C[NH+]4CCC3CC4)cc(Cl)cc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups including an amide (N1C(=O)CO), a phenolic ring (c2c(Cl)cc2), and a substituted benzene ring (c2c(C(=O)NC3C[NH+]4CCC3CC4)). These functional groups suggest that the molecule could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction, transport, or enzymatic activity.
Step 2: The presence of a phenolic group (Cl) and a substituted benzene ring suggests potential interactions with enzymes that metabolize drugs or other small molecules, such as those encoded by CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. These enzymes are involved in phase I drug metabolism.
Step 3: The amide group (N1C(=O)CO) and the overall structure of the molecule indicate it may have agonist or antagonist activity towards receptors. Specifically, it could potentially interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are associated with dopamine signaling, or HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are associated with serotonin signaling.
Step 4: The molecule's structure also hints at potential interactions with ion channels. For instance, the presence of a phenolic ring and the overall structure might suggest it could affect KCNH2, a potassium channel protein.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and KCNH2. These genes encode proteins involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmitter signaling, and ion channel function, which are key processes that could be influenced by the molecule's structure.
