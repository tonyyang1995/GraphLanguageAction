Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(C(C)C)cc1[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples.
Step 1: The molecule Cc1ccc(C(C)C)cc1[O-] has a benzene ring with an attached cyclohexane-like structure and a negatively charged oxygen atom. This structure suggests potential interactions with receptors or enzymes that bind to or metabolize molecules with similar structural features.
Step 2: Benzene rings are often involved in binding to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are associated with many of the listed genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. The presence of a benzene ring in the molecule could potentially interact with these receptors.
Step 3: The cyclohexane-like structure and the negatively charged oxygen atom might suggest the molecule could be a substrate for enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are involved in phase I metabolism reactions.
Step 4: The molecule's charge could also indicate it may interact with ion channels, like KCNH2, or with transporters, such as SLC6A2 and SLC6A4, depending on its overall charge and size.
Step 5: Based on the structural features of the molecule, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, KCNH2, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4. 
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, KCNH2, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
