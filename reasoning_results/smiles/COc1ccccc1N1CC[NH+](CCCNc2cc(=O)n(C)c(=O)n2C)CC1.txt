Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccccc1N1CC[NH+](CCCNc2cc(=O)n(C)c(=O)n2C)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple rings and functional groups such as a benzene ring, a pyridine ring, and amide and ester functionalities. This structure suggests potential interactions with receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-CONH-) and an ester group (-COOR), along with a nitrogen atom potentially capable of forming hydrogen bonds, indicates that this molecule could interact with receptors that have similar functional groups for ligand binding. These include G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels.
Step 3: Considering the pattern of the molecule, it may interact with GPCRs such as HTR1A (serotonin 1A receptor), HTR2A (serotonin 2A receptor), HTR2B (serotonin 2B receptor), and HTR2C (serotonin 2C receptor). These receptors are known to bind various ligands and modulators, which can influence their activity and downstream signaling pathways.
Step 4: The molecule might also interact with enzymes like CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs and xenobiotics. These cytochrome P450 enzymes catalyze the oxidation of substrates, and the presence of functional groups in the molecule could make it a substrate for these enzymes.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related genes to this molecule are likely to be those encoding receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism, including HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4.
