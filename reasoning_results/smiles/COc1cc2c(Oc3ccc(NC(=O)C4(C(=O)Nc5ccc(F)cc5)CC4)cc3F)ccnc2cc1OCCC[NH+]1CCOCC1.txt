Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc2c(Oc3ccc(NC(=O)C4(C(=O)Nc5ccc(F)cc5)CC4)cc3F)ccnc2cc1OCCC[NH+]1CCOCC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this relationship matters or its implications.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with multiple substituents including an oxazole ring, a pyrrole ring, and a fluorine atom. This complex aromatic structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism and transport, such as those encoded by CYP (cytochrome P450) family genes and ABC transporters.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) and amide linkages could indicate the molecule may interact with receptors or enzymes that have similar functional groups. For example, the CYP family of genes are known to metabolize compounds containing these functional groups.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a quinoline-like structure and a benzothiazole moiety. These features might suggest potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are often involved in neurotransmission and hormone signaling pathways. Genes such as HTR (serotonin receptors), DRD (dopamine receptors), and HRH (histamine receptors) are examples of GPCRs.
Step 4: Given the presence of a carboxamide group and a nitrophenyl group, the molecule could potentially inhibit or activate enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways. Genes like PTGS1 (COX-1/COX-2), which are involved in prostaglandin synthesis, and ESR1 (estrogen receptor alpha), which is involved in estrogen signaling, could be relevant.
Step 5: The overall structure of the molecule, particularly the presence of multiple functional groups and aromatic rings, suggests it could interact with various cellular targets, including ion channels and kinases. Genes such as KCNH2 (potassium channel subfamily H member 2), LCK (Lck tyrosine kinase), and MCL1 (myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1) are involved in these processes.
