Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(=O)Oc1ccc(C(c2ccc(OC(C)=O)cc2)c2ccccn2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring system, an amide group (-CO-N), and a pyrrole ring. The presence of a benzene ring suggests potential interactions with aromatic amino acids in proteins, which are encoded by genes like CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). These enzymes are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The amide group in the molecule could interact with acidic residues such as carboxyl groups (-COOH) or amine groups (-NH2) in proteins. This interaction might be relevant to genes encoding receptors that have acidic or basic regions, such as DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), HTR1A (serotonin receptor 1A), and HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A).
Step 3: The pyrrole ring in the molecule may contribute to its binding affinity for certain protein targets, potentially interacting with aromatic amino acid residues. This feature is particularly relevant to genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as ADRA1D (adrenergic receptor alpha-1D), ADRA2B (adrenergic receptor alpha-2B), ADRB2 (adrenergic receptor beta-2), CHRM1 (cholinergic receptor muscarinic M1), CHRM3 (cholinergic receptor muscarinic M3), and CHRM4 (cholinergic receptor muscarinic M4).
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule, with its combination of aromatic rings, amide, and pyrrole functionalities, is indicative of a small molecule that could modulate various cellular processes through interaction with multiple protein targets. This broad interaction profile might be associated with genes involved in signaling pathways, such as PTGS1 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1) and SIGMAR1 (sigma receptor 1), which are involved in inflammation and pain modulation.
Step 5: Considering the above structural features and their potential interactions with protein targets, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, PTGS1, and SIGMAR1.
