Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc2c(=Nc3ccc(Br)cc3F)[n-]cnc2cc1OCC1CC[NH+](C)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure containing a pyridine ring fused to a benzene ring, with a quinoline-like substituent attached to the benzene ring. This structure includes a nitrogen atom that forms a ketone group and is part of a heterocyclic system. The presence of a bromine atom and a fluorine atom indicates that the molecule has functional groups that can participate in various biological interactions.
Step 2: The molecule also contains a carboxylic acid group and an amide linkage, which are common in ligands for receptors and transporters involved in neurotransmission and other physiological processes. The presence of these functional groups suggests that the molecule could interact with proteins that have binding sites for such moieties.
Step 3: Given the structure of the molecule, it is plausible that it could interact with receptors that have similar chemical properties, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels. For example, it might bind to adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), or dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4).
Step 4: The molecule's ability to form hydrogen bonds and its hydrophobic core might allow it to interact with enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are known to metabolize drugs and xenobiotics. Additionally, the molecule's structure could potentially affect the activity of kinases such as CDK2 and LCK, which are involved in cell cycle regulation and signal transduction pathways.
Step 5: Considering the above structural and functional characteristics, the molecule may be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CDK2, LCK. These genes encode proteins that are likely to interact with the molecule based on its structure and potential pharmacological activities.
