Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCC(=O)n1[n-]c(=NCc2ccccc2OC)[n-]c1=NCc1ccccc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule containing several functional groups such as amides, imines, and aromatic rings, which are characteristic of many drug-like molecules. This indicates that the molecule likely interacts with biological targets through these functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring system (indicated by the 'n' in the SMILES) suggests potential interactions with receptors that contain binding sites for nitrogen-containing ligands. Such receptors include those associated with neurotransmitters and hormones.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a benzene ring (indicated by 'c' in the SMILES), which is common in many drugs due to its planar structure and ability to form stable interactions with proteins. Benzene rings are often involved in binding to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 4: Considering the presence of amide and ester groups, this molecule could interact with enzymes like CYP2D6, which metabolizes drugs containing these functional groups, or with receptors that have amine-binding pockets, such as those listed under the HTR (serotonin receptor) family.
Step 5: Based on the above structural features, the molecule is most likely to be related to genes encoding GPCRs (e.g., ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) and enzymes involved in drug metabolism (e.g., CYP2D6).
