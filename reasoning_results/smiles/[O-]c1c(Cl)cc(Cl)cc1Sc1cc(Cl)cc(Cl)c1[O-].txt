Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [O-]c1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Sc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex molecule with multiple rings and substituents, including chlorine atoms. This structure suggests potential interactions with various biological processes due to its diverse functional groups.
Step 2: Upon closer inspection, the presence of aromatic rings and halogenated substituents indicates that this molecule could potentially interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP (cytochrome P450) family genes. Specifically, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are known to metabolize drugs containing aromatic and halogenated structures.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a sulfonamide group (-S(=O)(=O)-N-) is characteristic of molecules that can act as inhibitors or agonists for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are involved in signal transduction pathways and are associated with several genes listed here, including DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), HTR1A (serotonin receptor 1A), HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A), HTR2B (serotonin receptor 2B), and HTR2C (serotonin receptor 2C).
Step 4: Furthermore, the overall structure may suggest interactions with ion channels, as it contains a pattern reminiscent of ligands that modulate potassium channels. This is relevant to KCNH2 (hERG potassium channel), which is important for cardiac function.
Step 5: Considering the above points, the molecule appears to be related to several genes involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmission, and ion channel modulation. The related gene names are: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and KCNH2.
Summary of Related Gene Names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- DRD2
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- KCNH2
Note: The other genes listed do not have direct structural or functional evidence from the given molecule's description. However, they might still be relevant in broader contexts not covered by the provided molecular structure.
