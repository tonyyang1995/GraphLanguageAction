Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCC[NH+](CCC)CCNC(=O)C1CCC[NH+](S(=O)(=O)c2ccc3c(c2)oc(=O)n3C)C1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains several aromatic rings, particularly phenyl rings, which are common in many drugs that interact with receptors and transporters. This structural feature suggests potential interactions with genes encoding for receptors or transporters.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (N-C=O) indicates the molecule could act as a ligand for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or ion channels, given that these often have binding sites for small molecules containing such functional groups.
Step 3: The presence of a carboxylic acid ester (O=C-O) and a sulfonate ester (O=S=O) suggests the molecule might interact with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize drugs containing these functional groups.
Step 4: Given the overall structure, the molecule could potentially interact with GPCRs like DRD2, HTR2A, and HRH1, as these receptors typically bind lipophilic molecules and often have binding sites for drugs containing aromatic and amide functionalities.
Step 5: The molecule also has a potential to interact with ion channels and transporters, possibly affecting genes such as KCNH2 and SLC6A4, due to the presence of aromatic rings and amine groups which are characteristic of molecules that interact with these types of proteins.
Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2
- HTR2A
- HRH1
- KCNH2
- SLC6A4
These genes encode for proteins that may directly interact with the described molecular structure. Other genes listed do not have a clear direct relationship based on the provided molecular structure and typical functions of the listed genes. However, this does not exclude the possibility of indirect effects or interactions through signaling pathways.
