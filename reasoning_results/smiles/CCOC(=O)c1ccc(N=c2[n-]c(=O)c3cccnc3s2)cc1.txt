Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N=c2[n-]c(=O)c3cccnc3s2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups including an amide (CO), a carboxylic acid (C=O), and a cyclic amine (N=c). This suggests it could interact with proteins that have binding sites for these functional groups.
Step 2: The cyclic amine group, specifically the one linked to the nitrogen atom, indicates potential interaction with receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4). These receptors often bind to amines and other small molecules.
Step 3: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (C=O) might suggest the molecule could interact with enzymes or transporters that recognize acidic functionalities, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: The amide (CO) group could also indicate potential interaction with proteins like G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HRH1, which often bind to amides and amines.
Step 5: Given the overall structure, the molecule might not directly relate to all listed genes but could potentially influence several receptor and enzyme-related genes due to its functional groups.
