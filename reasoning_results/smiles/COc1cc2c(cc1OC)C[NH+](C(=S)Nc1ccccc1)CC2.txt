Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc2c(cc1OC)C[NH+](C(=S)Nc1ccccc1)CC2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is often involved in drug interactions with various receptors and enzymes. This structural feature suggests potential interactions with genes encoding for proteins that bind or metabolize drugs.
Step 2: The molecule also has a pyridine ring, which can form hydrogen bonds and participate in electron transfer processes. This could indicate potential interactions with genes encoding ion channels or transporters, such as KCNH2 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2).
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a sulfoxide group (-SO-) and a thiazole ring may suggest metabolic pathways involving CYP enzymes. Genes such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 are known to be involved in the metabolism of drugs containing these functional groups.
Step 4: The molecule's overall structure, including its aromatic rings and heteroatoms, could potentially interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Genes like DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), HTR1A (serotonin receptor 1A), and HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A) encode for GPCRs that might be affected by this molecule.
Step 5: Given the presence of a carbamate group (-CONH-) and an amide linkage, the molecule might interact with acetylcholine receptors. Genes such as CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4, which encode for muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, could be relevant in this context.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP1A2
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- DRD2
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- CHRM1
- CHRM3
- CHRM4

Note: The genes SLC6A2 and SLC6A4 are included based on their role in neurotransmitter transport, which might be indirectly related to the molecule's structure. However, their direct interaction with the molecule is less certain compared to the other listed genes. The other genes are more directly linked to the molecule's structural features and potential pharmacological effects.
