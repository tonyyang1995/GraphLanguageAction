Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(C(=O)N=c2nc(-c3ccncc3)[n-][n-]2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a benzene ring with a cyano group (-CN), an amide group (-CONH2), and a pyrrole ring fused to the benzene ring. These structural features suggest that the molecule could be a ligand for receptors or enzymes that interact with such functional groups.
Step 2: Looking at the genes listed, several are involved in neurotransmitter systems (e.g., HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) which are known to bind various ligands, including those with amide and aromatic groups. The presence of the amide and aromatic groups in the molecule makes it plausible that it could interact with these receptors.
Step 3: Additionally, some genes encode enzymes that metabolize drugs or xenobiotics (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). The presence of an amide and an ester group in the molecule indicates it could be a substrate for these enzymes. 
Step 4: The molecule also has a quinoline-like structure, which might be recognized by certain ion channels or transporters (e.g., KCNH2, SLC6A2, SLC6A4). These genes are involved in the regulation of ion fluxes and neurotransmitter reuptake, respectively.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, KCNH2, SLC6A2, SLC6A4. These genes are involved in neurotransmitter signaling, drug metabolism, and ion channel function.
