Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCc1sc(-c2c3c([n-]c(=N)c2C#N)CCCCCC3)cc1[N+](=O)[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound that includes a quinolizidine ring system, which is a key structural feature. This ring system is often found in molecules with pharmacological activity, particularly in compounds that interact with receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrile group (-CN) and an amide group (-CONH-) suggests that the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of certain enzymes or proteins. Nitriles are known to form stable complexes with metal ions and can also act as electrophilic reagents in enzymatic reactions. Amides are common functional groups in drug molecules and can participate in hydrogen bonding and other interactions with biological targets.
Step 3: The aromatic nitro group (NO2) is another significant structural element, as it can contribute to the molecule's ability to interact with various targets through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. Nitro groups are often involved in the regulation of enzyme activity and can serve as substrates for cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Step 4: Given the presence of multiple functional groups and the overall complexity of the molecule, it is likely to have diverse interactions with different proteins and enzymes. For example, it could potentially interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), ion channels, or enzymes involved in metabolism.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and potential interactions, the related genes would likely include those encoding enzymes involved in drug metabolism (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and receptors that might be targeted by this molecule (e.g., HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4). Additionally, genes involved in the regulation of neuronal signaling pathways might be relevant due to the presence of amide and nitrile groups, which could interact with neurotransmitter receptors.

These genes are related to the molecule due to their involvement in metabolic pathways and receptor functions that could be influenced by the molecule's structure. However, without further experimental data, it cannot be conclusively stated that the molecule directly interacts with these genes or their encoded proteins. Further testing would be required to establish any direct relationships. 
Note: The provided SMILES string represents a complex molecule that could potentially interact with multiple biological targets. The related gene list is based on the structural features of the molecule and their possible interactions with biological systems. Additional research would be necessary to confirm any specific interactions. 
The gene names listed are not exhaustive and may vary depending on the exact mechanism of action of the molecule. Other genes related to drug metabolism and receptor function could also be relevant. 
The relationship between the molecule and the related genes is based on the structural features of the molecule and their potential to interact with biological targets. The molecule's structure includes functional groups that are known to interact with enzymes and receptors, suggesting that it could influence the expression or
