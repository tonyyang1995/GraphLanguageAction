Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCC(C)n1ncn(-c2ccc(N3CCN(c4ccc(OCC5COC(Cn6cncn6)(c6ccc(Cl)cc6Cl)O5)cc4)CC3)cc2)c1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings, including a benzene ring, a pyridine ring, and a heterocyclic ring containing nitrogen and oxygen atoms. It also contains hydroxyl (-OH) and amide (-CONH2) functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring, which is common in many drug molecules, suggests that this molecule could interact with proteins that have binding sites for aromatic compounds. One such protein family includes the G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are involved in various signaling pathways and are associated with several of the listed genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule's amide group could potentially form hydrogen bonds, which is important for interactions with enzymes or receptors. This feature is relevant to enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize various drugs.
Step 4: The molecule’s structure also indicates potential for interaction with ion channels, particularly due to its heterocyclic nature. This is relevant to the gene KCNH2, which codes for a voltage-gated potassium channel.
Step 5: Considering the complexity and the presence of functional groups that can participate in various types of molecular interactions, the molecule is likely to be related to several of the listed genes, primarily those involved in receptor binding (GPCRs) and drug metabolism (CYP enzymes).
