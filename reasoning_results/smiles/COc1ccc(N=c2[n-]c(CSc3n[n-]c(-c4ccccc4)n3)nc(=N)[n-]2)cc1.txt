Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(N=c2[n-]c(CSc3n[n-]c(-c4ccccc4)n3)nc(=N)[n-]2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with a heterocyclic core, specifically a pyrrole ring fused to a benzene ring. This structure includes multiple nitrogen atoms that are potentially involved in forming various functional groups such as amine, imine, and nitrile functionalities. The presence of these functional groups suggests potential interactions with proteins that contain amino acid residues, particularly those with basic side chains like lysine.
Step 2: The molecule also contains a tricyclic structure involving aromatic rings (benzene) and a heterocyclic ring (pyrrole), which could indicate the possibility of interaction with receptors or enzymes that have similar structural preferences. This could include G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or other membrane-bound proteins.
Step 3: Considering the presence of amine and imine functionalities, this molecule might interact with enzymes or receptors that have catalytic or binding sites for these functional groups. For example, enzymes like CYP2D6, which metabolizes many drugs and xenobiotics, might be influenced by such functional groups due to their ability to form covalent bonds with substrates.
Step 4: The molecule’s structure may also suggest potential interactions with GPCRs, given the overall shape and presence of basic functional groups. GPCRs are known to bind to ligands with specific shapes and charge distributions, and the molecule's structure aligns well with this requirement. Genes encoding GPCRs include DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HRH1, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule could be related to several genes encoding GPCRs and enzymes involved in drug metabolism. The related gene names are: DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HRH1, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2D6.
Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- HRH1
- CHRM1
- CHRM3
- CHRM4
- CYP2D6
These genes are likely to be involved in the pharmacological effects of the molecule, including receptor binding and metabolism.
