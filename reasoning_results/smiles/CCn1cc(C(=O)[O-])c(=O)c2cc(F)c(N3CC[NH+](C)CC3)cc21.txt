Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCn1cc(C(=O)[O-])c(=O)c2cc(F)c(N3CC[NH+](C)CC3)cc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring (indicated by "n1...c1") which suggests it may interact with receptors that have similar functional groups such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are involved in signal transduction pathways and are known to be modulated by various ligands.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-C(=O)-N-) indicates the potential for interactions with enzymes or receptors that recognize such functional groups. For instance, amides can be recognized by kinases or dehydrogenases, which are associated with several genes listed here, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, all of which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a carboxylate group (-[O-]) and a phenolic hydroxyl group, which could potentially interact with ion channels or transporters. For example, the carboxylate group might bind to proton pumps or other ion channels, while the phenolic group could interact with transporters like SLC6A2 and SLC6A4, both of which are involved in neurotransmitter reuptake.
Step 4: Given the complex structure, the molecule might also interact with receptors or enzymes that are part of signaling pathways, such as HRH1 (histamine H1 receptor), HTR1A (serotonin 1A receptor), HTR2A (serotonin 2A receptor), and HTR2B (serotonin 2B receptor), all of which are involved in various physiological responses including mood regulation and pain perception.
Step 5: Based on the identified structural features, the molecule could be related to the following genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, and HTR2B. These genes are involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmission, respectively.
