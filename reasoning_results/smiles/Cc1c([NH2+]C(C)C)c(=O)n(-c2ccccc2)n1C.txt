Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1c([NH2+]C(C)C)c(=O)n(-c2ccccc2)n1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure containing a pyrrolidine ring, an amide group, and a substituted benzene ring. This structure is characteristic of many ligands that can interact with receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of a primary amine (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group suggests that this molecule could act as both a ligand and a potential substrate for various enzymes. 
Step 3: The amine group could potentially bind to receptor proteins that have a binding site for basic amino groups, such as some G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 4: Given the presence of a benzene ring and amide functionality, this molecule may also be able to interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism like cytochrome P450s (CYP enzymes), particularly CYP2D6, which metabolizes a wide range of drugs including those with aromatic rings and amide bonds.
Step 5: Considering the above structural features, the molecule could be related to several genes encoding drug targets and metabolic enzymes, specifically:
- ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2 - GPCRs that may interact with the amine group
- CYP2D6 - Involved in the metabolism of the molecule
- DRD2, DRD3, DRD4 - Dopamine receptors that could bind the amine
- CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4 - Other CYP enzymes that might metabolize the molecule
- PTGS1 - Encodes COX-1, which could interact with the carboxylic acid group
