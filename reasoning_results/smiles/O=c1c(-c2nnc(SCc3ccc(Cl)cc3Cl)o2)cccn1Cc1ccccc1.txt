Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1c(-c2nnc(SCc3ccc(Cl)cc3Cl)o2)cccn1Cc1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a cyano group (-CN) attached, which is characteristic of many drugs that interact with receptors or transporters. This structural feature may suggest potential interactions with genes encoding for receptors or transporters.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a quinoline ring system, which is known to interact with various enzymes involved in drug metabolism. This indicates possible relationships with genes coding for enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4.
Step 3: The presence of a phenyl ring and a nitrophenyl group suggests potential interactions with genes encoding for ion channels or receptors, such as KCNH2 and DRD2.
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule, including its aromatic rings and functional groups, could indicate potential binding to genes involved in neurotransmitter systems, such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, KCNH2, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C. 
Summary of Related Genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, KCNH2, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C.
