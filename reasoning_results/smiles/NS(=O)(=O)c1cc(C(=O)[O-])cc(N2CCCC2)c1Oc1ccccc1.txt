Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NS(=O)(=O)c1cc(C(=O)[O-])cc(N2CCCC2)c1Oc1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple functional groups such as an amide, ester, and alcohol. This structure suggests that it could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways or metabolic processes.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of an ester group (-COO-) and a carboxylate (-COO-) indicates potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP (cytochrome P450) genes. These enzymes are crucial for drug metabolism and could be directly influenced by the molecule's chemical structure.
Step 3: The molecule also has a quinolone-like structure, which is characteristic of compounds that can interact with ion channels and receptors. This structural feature might relate to genes encoding ion channel proteins or receptors, such as KCNH2 (hERG potassium channel subunit), which is involved in cardiac repolarization and could be affected by the molecule's binding affinity.
Step 4: Given the presence of a benzene ring and various substituents, the molecule may have the potential to bind to nuclear receptors or other transcription factors, which could be influenced by the expression levels of genes like NR1 (nuclear receptor subfamily 1) or NR2 (nuclear receptor subfamily 2). These genes play roles in regulating gene expression and could be modulated by the molecule.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and potential interactions, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, KCNH2, NR1, NR2.
