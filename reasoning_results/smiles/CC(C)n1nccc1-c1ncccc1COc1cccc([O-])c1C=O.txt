Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)n1nccc1-c1ncccc1COc1cccc([O-])c1C=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with multiple substituents, including a nitrile group (-CN), an amide group (-CONH2), and a carboxylate group (-COOH). These functional groups suggest the molecule may be involved in interactions with proteins that have binding sites for such groups.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of a carboxylate group (-COOH) and an amide group (-CONH2) indicates the molecule could potentially interact with enzymes or receptors that recognize acidic or basic functional groups. This suggests possible interactions with genes encoding for enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize compounds with these functional groups.
Step 3: The nitrile group (-CN) might also indicate potential interactions with enzymes or receptors that bind to this functional group. This could suggest a connection to genes such as CYP2D6, which encodes an enzyme that can oxidize nitriles.
Step 4: Given the overall structure, the molecule might interact with ion channels or receptors that have binding pockets capable of accommodating aromatic rings and polar functional groups. This could imply potential interactions with genes like KCNH2 (encoding a potassium channel) and HTR2A (encoding a serotonin receptor).
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes, including CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, KCNH2, and HTR2A. These genes encode enzymes and receptors that could interact with the molecule due to its functional groups and overall structure. 
Summary of Related Genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, KCNH2, HTR2A.
