Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCn1c(=O)c2[n-]c(-c3ccc(S(=O)(=O)[O-])cc3)nc2n(CCC)c1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring, a pyridine ring, a sulfonamide group, and an amide group. These structural features suggest the molecule may interact with proteins involved in signal transduction and receptor binding.
Step 2: The presence of a sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)[O-]) is particularly notable as it is often found in drugs that inhibit enzymes such as CYP2C19 and CYP2C9, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The amide group (-C(=O)n-) and the benzene ring suggest the molecule could potentially bind to receptors like adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B) and dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3), which are known to have amide-containing ligands.
Step 4: Given the presence of a pyridine ring and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), this molecule might also interact with ion channels (CACNA1H, KCNH2) and kinases (CDK2, LCK).
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and potential interactions, the most likely related genes are those involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C19, CYP2C9), adrenergic signaling (ADRA1D, ADRA2B), dopaminergic signaling (DRD2, DRD3), and ion channel function (CACNA1H, KCNH2). 
Summary of Related Genes:
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- DRD2
- DRD3
- CACNA1H
- KCNH2
Note: The exact interaction and specificity would require further detailed analysis, but the listed genes are the most probable based on the molecule's structure. The other genes are less likely to be directly related given the molecule's composition.
