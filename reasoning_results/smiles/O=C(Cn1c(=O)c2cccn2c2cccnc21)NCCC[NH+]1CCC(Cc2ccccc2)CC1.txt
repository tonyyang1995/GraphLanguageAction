Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Cn1c(=O)c2cccn2c2cccnc21)NCCC[NH+]1CCC(Cc2ccccc2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule likely to be an inhibitor of various enzymes and receptors. The molecule contains a pyrrole ring system, which is characteristic of many enzyme inhibitors and receptor ligands. This structural feature suggests that the molecule could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrile group (-CN) and a cyano group (-C#N) indicates potential reactivity with enzymes such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, which are known to metabolize drugs and other xenobiotics. Specifically, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 are known to metabolize compounds containing these functional groups.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a quinoline-like structure, which is common in ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are often targeted by drugs, and the presence of this structure suggests the molecule might interact with GPCRs, particularly those involved in neurotransmission, such as HTR1A (serotonin receptor), HTR2A (serotonin receptor), and DRD2 (dopamine receptor).
Step 4: The molecule's overall structure, including its aromatic rings and heteroatoms, provides a pattern that could potentially bind to ion channels, such as KCNH2 (hERG potassium channel). This interaction could influence the activity of these channels, which are involved in various physiological processes and are targets for therapeutic interventions.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and functional groups present, the molecule is likely to interact with several of the listed genes, primarily those involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C19, CYP2D6), neurotransmission (HTR1A, HTR2A, DRD2), and ion channel function (KCNH2). Additionally, it may have some interactions with genes encoding enzymes like PTGS1 (cyclooxygenase-1) due to its potential to modulate inflammatory pathways.
Summary of Related Gene Names:
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- DRD2
