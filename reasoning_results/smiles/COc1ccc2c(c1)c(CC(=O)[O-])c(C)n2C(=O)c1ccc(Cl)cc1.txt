Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc2c(c1)c(CC(=O)[O-])c(C)n2C(=O)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, specifically a phenol group and a pyridine-like structure, which are common in ligands that interact with certain receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an amide (-CONH-) suggests the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 3: The molecule includes a quinoline-like moiety, which is known to interact with various G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 4: Given the structural features, the molecule may have affinity for receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), and possibly serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule might interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are involved in drug metabolism.
