Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)(Oc1ccc(C(=O)c2ccc(Cl)cc2)cc1)C(=O)[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with an oxygen atom attached (phenol group), which is part of the core structure. This pattern is common in drugs that interact with receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways.
Step 2: The molecule also has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) attached to the benzene ring. Carboxylic acids are known to interact with various proteins, including ion channels and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are encoded by some of the listed genes.
Step 3: The presence of a cyano group (CN) in the molecule suggests potential interactions with enzymes such as CYP2D6, which metabolizes many drugs and xenobiotics. CYP2D6 is included in the list of genes.
Step 4: The overall structure includes a quinoline-like motif, which could potentially interact with DNA-binding proteins or other large molecules, possibly relevant to genes involved in transcriptional regulation or signal transduction pathways, such as PTGS1 (COX-2), which is also present in the list.
Step 5: Given the structural features described, the molecule is likely to interact with several of the listed genes, particularly those involved in neurotransmission, signal transduction, and drug metabolism. These include: CYP2D6, PTGS1, and others not directly mentioned but related through similar mechanisms.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2D6
- PTGS1
- ESR1 (estrogen receptor)
- HRH1 (histamine H1 receptor)
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6 (serotonin receptors)
- DRD2, DRD3, DRD4 (dopamine receptors) To provide a more focused and concise summary:
- ESR1
- HRH1
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- DRD2, DRD3, DRD4 Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with an oxygen atom (phenol group) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), suggesting interactions with receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The cyano group (CN) indicates potential interaction with CYP2D6, an enzyme involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The quinoline-like motif may interact with DNA-binding proteins or other large molecules, potentially relevant to PTGS1 (COX-2).
Step 4: The overall structure suggests interactions with estrogen receptors (ESR1) and histamine receptors (HRH1).
Step 5: Specific serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) and dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) are likely targets due to their common ligand binding sites. Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2, DRD3, DRD
