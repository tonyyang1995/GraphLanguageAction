Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCn1nc(Oc2nc(=NC(C)C)[n-]c(=NCC)[n-]2)ccc1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a tricyclic structure with a nitrogen atom in the center, which is characteristic of imidazolines and imidazoles. This structural feature is relevant to several G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which all have imidazole or similar functional groups in their ligand binding sites.
Step 2: The presence of an oxygen atom attached to the nitrogen in the central ring suggests a possible amine or amide functionality, which could interact with the acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4) and the serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Step 3: The molecule also includes a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH), which can participate in hydrogen bonding and may interact with enzymes like CYP2C19 and CYP2C9, known for their role in metabolizing drugs containing phenolic groups.
Step 4: The overall structure includes a quinoline-like moiety, which might interact with certain GPCRs and ion channels. This is relevant to the calcium channel CACNA1H and the receptor tyrosine kinase LCK, as both contain quinoline or quinoline-like structures in their active sites.
Step 5: The molecule's complex structure with multiple rings and functional groups suggests potential interactions with various receptors and enzymes, including but not limited to the above-mentioned genes.
