Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)c1cc(NC(=O)c2ccc(C)cc2)c(=O)oc1-c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound that includes multiple functional groups such as an amide (N-C=O), a phenol (OH), a lactam (N-C=O within a cyclic structure), and a benzene ring system. These structural features suggest potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for similar functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of a lactam and amide groups could indicate a relationship with genes encoding enzymes involved in metabolism of drugs or other small molecules. For example, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are known to metabolize various drugs, and their involvement could be relevant if the molecule acts as a substrate or inhibitor for these enzymes.
Step 3: The molecule’s structure also hints at possible interaction with receptors or ion channels. The presence of aromatic rings and amine groups might be relevant to genes coding for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are known to interact with ligands containing similar chemical moieties.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a lactam and amide functionalities suggests that the molecule might interact with enzymes or transporters involved in neurotransmitter reuptake or metabolism, such as SLC6A2 and SLC6A4, which are involved in the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine, respectively.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions with various biological targets, the related genes include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4. These genes encode enzymes and receptors that could interact directly or indirectly with the described molecule. 
Summary of Related Genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
