Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCn1cnc2sc(C(=O)Nc3ccccc3OC)c(C)c2c1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples or additional text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a tricyclic core with a pyrrole ring fused to an imidazole ring, which is characteristic of molecules known to interact with receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction. This structural feature suggests potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes that metabolize neurotransmitters or hormones.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-CO-NH-) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) indicates the molecule could act as a ligand or substrate for enzymes such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes, which are involved in drug metabolism. Specifically, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 are known to metabolize many drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: The molecule also has a benzene ring with a substituent that could interact with aromatic amino acids in receptor binding sites, potentially affecting the activity of GPCRs like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are dopamine receptors.
Step 4: The presence of a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a carbonyl group (-C=O) in the molecule suggests it may be a substrate for esterases or other hydrolases, which could modulate its pharmacological activity. This feature is relevant to genes involved in esterase activity, such as PTGS1, which encodes cyclooxygenase-1, an enzyme that can be inhibited by certain drugs.
Step 5: Given the structural complexity and potential for interactions with multiple biological pathways, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes including those encoding GPCRs (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), enzymes involved in drug metabolism (CYP2D6, CYP2C19), and receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmitter signaling (CNR1, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
