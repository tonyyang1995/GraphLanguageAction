Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C1NCC2(CC[NH+](CCc3ccccc3)CC2)O1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a structure that includes a ketone (C=O), a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (N+), and aromatic rings (c3ccccc3). This structure suggests the molecule could be a ligand for receptors or enzymes involved in signal transduction or metabolism.
Step 2: Looking at the gene list provided, we see several genes associated with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are often activated by small molecules. Notably, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4 encode for adrenergic and cholinergic receptors, respectively. These receptors can bind to small molecules like the given molecule due to their ability to recognize various ligands.
Step 3: Additionally, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 are cytochrome P450 enzymes that can metabolize the given molecule. Cytochrome P450 enzymes are known to oxidize drugs and other small molecules, which aligns with the presence of the ketone group in the molecule.
Step 4: The molecule's structure also hints at potential interactions with G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways, as it contains features that could mimic agonists or antagonists for these receptors. For instance, the presence of an amine group (NH+) and aromatic rings could contribute to binding sites for certain GPCRs.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structural features, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. These genes are involved in the synthesis, function, and metabolism of neurotransmitters and hormones, which are key components in the signaling pathways mediated by the aforementioned receptors.
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19.
