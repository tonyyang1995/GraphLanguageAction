Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N=c1[n-]cccc1-c1nc2ccccc2[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a tricyclic compound with a nitrogen atom double-bonded to a carbon, forming a six-membered ring. It also contains two nitrogen atoms that are negatively charged (-) and are connected to benzene rings. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in neurotransmission and receptor binding.
Step 2: The presence of aromatic rings and the overall molecular shape could indicate a possible interaction with receptors that have similar structural features. For example, adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), and serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) all have characteristic shapes that allow them to bind to ligands, including small molecules like the one described.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule's negative charges could be relevant for interactions with ion channels and transporters. For instance, the calcium channel subunit (CACNA1H) and the potassium channel subunit (KCNH2) both have regions that can interact with charged molecules.
Step 4: Furthermore, the presence of a benzene ring system in the molecule might suggest potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). These enzymes are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics, which could include this molecule.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule may be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CACNA1H, KCNH2, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. These genes encode proteins that are involved in neurotransmission, ion channel function, and drug metabolism. The molecule's structure suggests it could potentially interact with these proteins through binding or modulation of their activity. ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CACNA1H, KCNH2, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
