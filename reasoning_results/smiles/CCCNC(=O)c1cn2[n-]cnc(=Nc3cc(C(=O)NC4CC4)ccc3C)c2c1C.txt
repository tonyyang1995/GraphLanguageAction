Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCNC(=O)c1cn2[n-]cnc(=Nc3cc(C(=O)NC4CC4)ccc3C)c2c1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups such as amide (N=C=O), aromatic rings (c1cn2[n-]cnc(=Nc3cc(C(=O)NC4CC4)ccc3C)), and heterocycles (C(=O)NC4CC4). These structural features suggest potential interactions with enzymes and receptors that have similar chemical functionalities.
Step 2: Among the provided genes, several are involved in drug metabolism and transport, including CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are all cytochrome P450 enzymes. The presence of an amide group and aromatic rings in the molecule could indicate it might be metabolized by these enzymes, making them relevant candidates for further investigation.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule contains a nitroimidazole ring (-n-), which is known to interact with various receptors and ion channels. Genes like CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4 (cholinergic receptors) and HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 (serotonin receptors) might be influenced by this structure due to their binding sites' affinity for similar functional groups.
Step 4: The presence of a benzene ring (C4CC4) suggests potential interactions with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4 (dopamine receptors) and HRH1 (histamine receptor). Benzene rings are common ligands for these receptors.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the potential interactions of the molecule with the following genes are noteworthy: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, and HRH1. These genes are involved in various physiological processes including neurotransmission, metabolism, and receptor signaling, indicating the molecule's possible impact on these pathways.
