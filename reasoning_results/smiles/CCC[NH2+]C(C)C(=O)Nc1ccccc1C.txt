Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCC[NH2+]C(C)C(=O)Nc1ccccc1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has an amine group (-NH2) attached to the nitrogen atom of an amide group (-CONH2), forming a primary amine. This functional group is often involved in interactions with proteins that have binding sites for amines, such as receptors or transporters.
Step 2: The molecule also contains a carboxyl group (-COOH) which can form hydrogen bonds with polar amino acid residues in protein structures, potentially influencing the binding affinity of the molecule to those proteins.
Step 3: The presence of a benzene ring (C6H5) in the molecule suggests it could interact with aromatic residues in proteins, possibly affecting its binding to certain receptors or transporters.
Step 4: Given the structure and functional groups, this molecule is likely to interact with proteins involved in neurotransmitter transport and receptor binding, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and transporters.
Step 5: Based on the molecular features, the most relevant genes would be those encoding for GPCRs and transporters, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C.

Note: The molecule's structure does not directly suggest strong relationships with other genes listed such as ABCB1, CYP enzymes, or EGFR, among others, as their functions and binding sites are more specialized and less likely to be influenced by the general structure of the provided molecule. However, further detailed analysis may reveal more specific interactions depending on the exact binding site of the molecule. Step 1: The molecule contains a primary amine group (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which are common functional groups in many small molecules that can interact with biological targets.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring (C6H5) indicates potential aromatic interactions with proteins, particularly those containing aromatic amino acids like tyrosine or phenylalanine.
Step 3: The molecule's linear structure and the combination of amine and carboxylic acid groups suggest it could act as a ligand for various receptors, including G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 4: Considering the molecular structure, the most relevant genes would be those associated with GPCRs and neurotransmitter transporters, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C.
