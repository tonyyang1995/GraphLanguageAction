Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Clc1ccc(N=c2[n-]nc(Cc3ccncc3)c3ccccc23)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this might be important.
Step 1: The molecule contains a tricyclic core with a nitrogen atom involved in a ring system. This pattern suggests potential interactions with receptors that have similar chemical structures, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 2: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) on the molecule could indicate a potential interaction with enzymes involved in metabolism, like CYP2D6 and CYP2C9, which are known to metabolize drugs containing nitro groups.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a pyrrolidine ring, which is a common feature in ligands for various receptors, including dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4). This structural similarity may allow the molecule to interact with these receptors.
Step 4: The molecule has a quinoline-like structure, which is often found in ligands for receptors such as HTR2A and HTR2B, which are serotonin receptors.
Step 5: Based on the above structural features, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR2A, HTR2B. Step 1: The molecule contains a tricyclic core with a nitrogen atom involved in a ring system. This pattern suggests potential interactions with receptors that have similar chemical structures, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 5: Based on the above structural features, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR2A, HTR2B.
