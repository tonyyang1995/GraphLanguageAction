Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: c1ccn(-c2ccc(N3CCOCC3)cc2)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule, represented by the SMILES string c1ccn(-c2ccc(N3CCOCC3)cc2)c1, has a benzene ring with a nitrogen atom attached to it. This nitrogen atom is part of an amide group (-CONH2), which is a functional group that can interact with proteins such as enzymes and receptors. The presence of this amide group suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in signal transduction and metabolism.
Step 2: The molecule contains a heterocyclic structure (the nitrogen-containing ring) and a hydroxyl group (-OH) in the form of an ester (COOC). These structural features are often recognized by drug targets such as enzymes and receptors, particularly those involved in neurotransmission and hormone signaling.
Step 3: Considering the pharmacological profile of the described molecule, it could potentially interact with receptors and enzymes that are involved in neurotransmission and hormonal pathways. For example, it might bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), HTR1A (Serotonin receptor 1A), and HTR2A (Serotonin receptor 2A), which are known to have amide and hydroxyl groups as key binding sites.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule might also interact with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as CYP2D6, which metabolizes many drugs including those that affect neurotransmitter systems. The presence of an amide and an ester group could make the molecule a substrate for CYP2D6, leading to metabolic activation or inactivation.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the genes related to the molecule include: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, CYP2D6.
Summary of related gene names: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, CYP2D6. These genes encode proteins that are likely to interact with the described molecule due to their functional groups and roles in neurotransmission and metabolism.
