Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+]1CCN(C2=[NH+]c3ccccc3Nc3ccccc32)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule has an amide group (-NH-) and a positively charged nitrogen atom, which suggests it could be an agonist or inhibitor for receptors that bind to such functional groups. The presence of a benzene ring and a substituted amine (NH+) indicates this molecule might interact with proteins that have similar structural motifs.
Step 2: Analyzing the structure further, we see a cyclic amine group connected to a benzene ring, which is a common feature in ligands that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are often involved in signaling pathways mediated by neurotransmitters and hormones. This suggests the molecule could potentially interact with receptors like those listed, particularly those related to neurotransmission and hormone binding.
Step 3: The presence of multiple rings and the overall complex structure of the molecule implies it could be a substrate for enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as cytochrome P450s (CYP), which are listed among the genes provided (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). These enzymes play a crucial role in metabolizing drugs and other xenobiotics.
Step 4: Considering the neurotransmitter and hormone receptor interactions, the molecule may also influence genes involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter systems, such as dopamine (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), serotonin (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), and acetylcholine (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CACNA1H, CDK2, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and OPARK1. These genes are related to the potential interaction of the molecule with receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism.
