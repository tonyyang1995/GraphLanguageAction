Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Cc1ccccc1)N=c1[n-]c(=O)c2ccccc2s1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a structure that includes an aromatic ring system (Cc1ccccc1) connected to a nitrile group (-N=c1), a carboxamide group (O=C), and a sulfhydryl group (s1). This structure suggests it may interact with proteins involved in signaling pathways, transport, or metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrile group and a carboxamide group indicates potential for binding to enzymes or receptors that recognize such functional groups, particularly those involved in neurotransmitter signaling, which could relate to genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other neurotransmitter-related genes.
Step 3: The aromatic ring system (Cc1ccccc1) is characteristic of many ligands for GPCRs, which are known to interact with various neurotransmitters and hormones. This feature could be relevant to genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and HRH1, all of which encode GPCRs.
Step 4: The sulfhydryl group (s1) might indicate the molecule could form covalent bonds or have redox-active properties, which could be relevant to genes involved in redox signaling or drug metabolism, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which encode cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Step 5: Given the molecule's structure, it is likely to interact with proteins involved in neurotransmitter signaling, receptor activation, and metabolic processes. Based on this analysis, the related genes are ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.
