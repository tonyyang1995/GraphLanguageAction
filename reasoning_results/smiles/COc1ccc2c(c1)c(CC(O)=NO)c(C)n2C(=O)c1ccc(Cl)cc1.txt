Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc2c(c1)c(CC(O)=NO)c(C)n2C(=O)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring system, which is characteristic of several psychoactive compounds. This structural feature could potentially interact with receptors involved in neurotransmission.
Step 2: The molecule also includes an indole moiety, commonly found in drugs that modulate the activity of enzymes like CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, which are involved in the metabolism of various drugs.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a nitro group and a quinoline ring might suggest potential interactions with enzymes such as CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, known for their role in drug metabolism.
Step 4: The overall structure may also indicate possible binding to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), given its aromatic rings and potential to form hydrogen bonds, which could relate to genes like HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, all encoding serotonin receptors.
Step 5: Considering the above structural features, the molecule is likely to be related to the genes CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C. 
Related genes: CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C.
