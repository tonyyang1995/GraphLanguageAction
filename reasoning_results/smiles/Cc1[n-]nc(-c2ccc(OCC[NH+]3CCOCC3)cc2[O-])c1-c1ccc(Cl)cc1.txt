Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1[n-]nc(-c2ccc(OCC[NH+]3CCOCC3)cc2[O-])c1-c1ccc(Cl)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that includes a heterocyclic ring system with nitrogen and oxygen functionalities. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for similar functional groups, such as nitrogen-containing heterocycles and aromatic rings.
Step 2: The presence of an amine group (-NH+) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in the molecule indicates it could interact with receptors or enzymes that have complementary binding sites. These functional groups are common in ligands that bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are often involved in signaling pathways.
Step 3: The aromatic ring systems in the molecule might also allow for interaction with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP enzymes), which are known to metabolize drugs through oxidation reactions involving aromatic rings. This interaction would be particularly relevant for CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4.
Step 4: Given the presence of a benzene ring and possibly other aromatic structures, the molecule may have affinity for kinases like LCK (Lck) or PTGS1 (COX-1/COX-2), which are involved in various cellular processes including signal transduction and inflammation.
Step 5: The overall structure and functional groups suggest potential interactions with neurotransmitter receptors, such as DRD2 (Dopamine D2 receptor), HTR2A (Serotonin 5-HT2A receptor), and HRH1 (Histamine H1 receptor), which are involved in neuropsychiatric disorders and drug addiction.
