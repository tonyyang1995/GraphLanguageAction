Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc(-c2oc3cc([O-])cc([O-])c3c(=O)c2[O-])ccc1[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure containing a benzene ring, a pyridine ring, and multiple functional groups such as hydroxyl (-OH), carboxyl (-COOH), and amide (-CONH2) groups. This structure suggests that the molecule could be a small organic compound, possibly an inhibitor or activator of enzymes or receptors.
Step 2: The presence of multiple negatively charged groups (-O- and [O-]) indicates that this molecule could act as a ligand for ion channels, receptors, or transporters that have binding sites for negatively charged molecules. This feature points towards potential interactions with genes encoding ion channels and receptors.
Step 3: Among the provided genes, those encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels are particularly relevant due to their involvement in signal transduction pathways and cellular responses. Specific genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and HRH1 encode GPCRs that might interact with this molecule.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule’s structure may also suggest potential interactions with enzymes encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism. These enzymes could metabolize the molecule, affecting its activity and pharmacokinetics.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the following genes are likely to have a direct or indirect relationship with the molecule: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These genes encode receptors and enzymes that could be targets or affected by the molecule's presence.
