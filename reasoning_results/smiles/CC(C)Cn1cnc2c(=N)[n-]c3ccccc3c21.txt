Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)Cn1cnc2c(=N)[n-]c3ccccc3c21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound with multiple functional groups including a benzene ring, a cyano group (-CN), a nitrogen-containing heterocycle, and a nitroso group (-N=O). These structural features suggest potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for aromatic compounds or contain nitrogen atoms.
Step 2: Among the provided genes, those encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are particularly relevant due to their common binding affinity for small molecules containing aromatic rings and heteroatoms like nitrogen. Notable examples include CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are all involved in neurotransmitter signaling.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a nitroso group may indicate a potential interaction with enzymes involved in metabolic pathways. CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are part of the cytochrome P450 superfamily responsible for metabolizing drugs and xenobiotics, could be relevant here.
Step 4: Furthermore, the molecule's structure might interact with ion channels, as suggested by the presence of a benzene ring and possibly a nitrogen-containing heterocycle. This could relate to KCNH2, which encodes an IKr potassium channel, important for cardiac repolarization.
Step 5: Lastly, the molecule's overall structure does not strongly suggest direct interactions with other genes listed, such as those involved in receptor tyrosine kinase activity (e.g., KDR, FLT1) or oncogene expression (e.g., HRH1, PTGS1).
Summary of related gene names: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, KCNH2.
