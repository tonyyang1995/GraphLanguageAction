Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CN=c1[n-]n2c(C)cc(CO)nc2c1S(=O)(=O)c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-S(=O)(=O)-) which is characteristic of drugs that interact with certain receptors and enzymes. This suggests potential interactions with genes involved in receptor signaling and drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a phenyl ring and a carboxylic acid group (CO) indicate the molecule could be an inhibitor or activator of enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The aromatic nitrogen-containing heterocycles (e.g., pyrrole and indole rings) suggest the molecule might interact with receptors like HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are G-protein coupled receptors involved in neurotransmission.
Step 4: The molecule's overall structure, including the presence of multiple functional groups, indicates it could modulate multiple targets, potentially interacting with several genes involved in various pathways, such as ABCB1, which encodes a drug efflux transporter.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, ABCB1.
