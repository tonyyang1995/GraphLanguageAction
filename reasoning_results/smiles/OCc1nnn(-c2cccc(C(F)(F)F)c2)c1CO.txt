Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: OCc1nnn(-c2cccc(C(F)(F)F)c2)c1CO, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule, which appears to be a derivative of morphine (a benzomorphan). This can be inferred from the presence of a benzene ring fused to an oxirane ring (oxirane being a cyclic ether) and the presence of multiple nitrogen atoms, which are characteristic of morphine-like structures.
Step 2: Morphine derivatives typically interact with opioid receptors, such as the mu-opioid receptor (MOR), which is encoded by the OPRK1 gene. The presence of multiple nitrogen atoms suggests that this molecule could potentially bind to and activate MOR, similar to how morphine does.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule contains fluorine atoms (-F), which are often used in drug design to increase lipophilicity and improve pharmacokinetic properties. These features are not directly related to any specific gene but enhance the molecule's ability to interact with receptors like MOR.
Step 4: Given the opioid receptor interaction potential, the related genes would include those involved in opioid signaling and regulation, such as OPRK1, which encodes the mu-opioid receptor. Other related genes might include those involved in downstream signaling pathways, such as HTR2A (serotonin 2A receptor) and HTR2B (serotonin 2B receptor), though their direct interaction with this molecule is less likely than with opioids.
Step 5: The related gene names, based on the described interactions, are:
- OPRK1 (mu-opioid receptor)
- HTR2A (serotonin 2A receptor)
- HTR2B (serotonin 2B receptor)
These genes are relevant due to the potential of the molecule to interact with opioid and serotonergic systems.
