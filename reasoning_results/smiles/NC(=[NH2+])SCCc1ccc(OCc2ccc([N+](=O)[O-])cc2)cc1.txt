Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NC(=[NH2+])SCCc1ccc(OCc2ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitroso group (NC(=[NH2+])) and a sulfide group (SC), which are common in drugs that interact with receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction.
Step 2: The presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group (OCc2ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc2) suggests potential interactions with receptors or enzymes that recognize such functional groups, particularly those involved in G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The overall structure includes aromatic rings and heteroatoms, which can form hydrogen bonds and other non-covalent interactions with proteins, potentially affecting GPCRs and ion channels.
Step 4: Given the molecular features, the molecule may interact with receptors and enzymes related to neurotransmitter signaling pathways, such as adrenergic (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and dopaminergic (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) systems.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule might influence cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) due to its complex structure, which could affect drug metabolism.
