Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccccc1-n1c(SCC(=O)NC2CCCCC2)nc2c(c1=O)SCC2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure that includes a benzene ring system, a thioether group, and a quinolone-like moiety. These structural features suggest that the molecule may interact with proteins involved in neurotransmitter transport or receptor activity.
Step 2: The presence of a quinolone-like moiety (a nitrogen-containing heterocycle with a quinoline backbone) indicates potential interactions with enzymes such as CYP2D6 and CYP2C9, which are involved in the metabolism of various drugs and endogenous compounds.
Step 3: The thioether group in the molecule could potentially interact with cysteine residues in protein targets, which might be relevant for proteins like KCNH2, a potassium channel protein, or SLC6A4, a sodium-dependent neurotransmitter transporter.
Step 4: Given the presence of a quinolone-like moiety and the thioether group, the molecule could influence receptors such as HTR2A, a serotonin receptor, and DRD2, a dopamine receptor, which are known to have quinoline-like ligands and thioether-containing compounds as modulators.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, KCNH2, SLC6A4, HTR2A, and DRD2.
