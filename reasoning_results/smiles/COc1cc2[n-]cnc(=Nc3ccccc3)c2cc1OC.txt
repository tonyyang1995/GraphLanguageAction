Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc2[n-]cnc(=Nc3ccccc3)c2cc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule, which appears to be a substituted benzene derivative containing a pyrrole ring, a phenyl ring, and a nitro group. This structure suggests that the molecule may interact with proteins involved in signal transduction, neurotransmission, and other cellular processes.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule (indicated by [n-]) suggests that it could be an amine or similar functional group, which is often involved in binding to receptors and enzymes. This functional group is particularly relevant for genes encoding receptors and enzymes.
Step 3: Considering the pattern of the molecule, it likely contains a functional group that can interact with protein structures, such as hydrogen bonding sites, hydrophobic patches, or charged regions. This interaction would be particularly important for genes that encode ion channels, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), and enzymes.
Step 4: Among the given genes, those encoding GPCRs and ion channels are most likely to be directly affected by this molecule due to its potential to bind to these proteins. Genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HRH1 encode receptors that could interact with the molecule.
Step 5: Additionally, genes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism and signaling might also be influenced by this molecule. Genes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and SLC6A4 are involved in the metabolism and transport of neurotransmitters and other small molecules, which could be affected by the molecule’s presence.
