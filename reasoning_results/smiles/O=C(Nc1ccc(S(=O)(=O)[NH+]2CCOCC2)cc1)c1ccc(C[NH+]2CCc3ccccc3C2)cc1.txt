Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Nc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)[NH+]2CCOCC2)cc1)c1ccc(C[NH+]2CCc3ccccc3C2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule in question contains multiple functional groups such as amide, ester, and aromatic rings. It also includes a sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)) and a nitrile group (-N=C-), which are characteristic of drug-like molecules often used for therapeutic purposes.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrile group suggests that the molecule could be involved in interactions with enzymes or receptors that are sensitive to such functional groups. Nitriles are known to form stable complexes with certain metal ions, which might affect the activity of metalloenzymes or ion channels.
Step 3: Given the complexity of the molecule, it likely targets multiple biological pathways. However, considering the provided list of genes, we need to identify those that are directly influenced by or interact with similar chemical structures. For instance, CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) are involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics, including drugs, which often contain nitrile, amide, or ester groups.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)) indicates potential interaction with sulfotransferases or other enzymes that process this type of functional group. Genes related to sulfotransferase activities, such as those involved in detoxification and drug metabolism, might be relevant here.
Step 5: Lastly, the molecule's overall structure and functional groups suggest it could have effects on neurotransmitter systems, given the presence of amine groups and potential interactions with receptors. Genes like HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode various subtypes of serotonin receptors, might be influenced by this molecule.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP1A2
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- HTR6 Step 5: Summary of related gene names:
- HTR6
These genes are likely to be affected by or interact with the molecule due to its chemical structure and functional groups.
