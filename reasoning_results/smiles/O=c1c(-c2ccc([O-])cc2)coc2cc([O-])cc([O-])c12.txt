Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1c(-c2ccc([O-])cc2)coc2cc([O-])cc([O-])c12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional analysis or speculation beyond the given information.
Step 1: The molecule has a structure that includes a benzene ring, a cyano group (-CN), and several oxygen-containing functional groups such as hydroxyl (-OH) and carboxyl (-COOH). These structural features suggest potential interactions with enzymes or receptors involved in drug metabolism and transport.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group and carboxyl groups could indicate the molecule is a potential substrate for CYP enzymes (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs. This interaction could influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the molecule.
Step 3: The molecule's structure also suggests it might interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), given the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups that could serve as ligands for such receptors. Notable GPCRs include DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are dopamine receptors, and HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are serotonin receptors.
Step 4: The benzene ring and hydroxyl groups in the molecule may also engage in interactions with ABC transporters like ABCB1, which are known to pump certain drugs out of cells, affecting their intracellular concentration and efficacy.
Step 5: Given the above structural features, the related genes are likely to be those involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), drug transport (ABCB1), and receptor signaling (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
