Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCc1cc2ccccc2c(OCC[NH+](C)C)n1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings and functional groups including an amine group (N), an alcohol group (O), and a carboxylate group (C=O). This type of molecule is often found as an agonist or antagonist for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or ion channels.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (N+) suggests that this molecule could act as an agonist for receptors that have a positively charged binding pocket, such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) or muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 3: The aromatic rings in the molecule might interact with other aromatic amino acid residues in the binding pockets of enzymes or receptors, which could affect the activity of genes involved in signal transduction pathways. For example, the molecule could potentially modulate the activity of kinases like LCK (Src family tyrosine kinase) or CDK2 (cyclin-dependent kinase 2).
Step 4: Given the presence of a carboxylic acid group, this molecule could also interact with ion channels, particularly those that are activated by changes in pH or voltage, such as KCNH2 (hERG potassium channel).
Step 5: The overall structure of the molecule, with its potential to bind to GPCRs, ion channels, and kinases, suggests it could be related to several genes involved in neurotransmission, signaling, and drug metabolism, such as DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and PTGS1 (COX-1/COX-2).
