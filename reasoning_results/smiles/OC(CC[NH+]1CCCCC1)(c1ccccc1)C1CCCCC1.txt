Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: OC(CC[NH+]1CCCCC1)(c1ccccc1)C1CCCCC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) and a benzene ring, which are common features in ligands for various receptors and enzymes. These structural elements suggest potential interactions with genes involved in receptor signaling and metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a pyrrolidine ring (N-H) and amide functionality could indicate a potential interaction with genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism.
Step 3: The alkyl chain and aromatic moieties might suggest binding to genes associated with ion channels and transporters, such as those involved in calcium and sodium ion regulation.
Step 4: The overall structure hints at possible interactions with genes encoding enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, due to the presence of functional groups that could be metabolized by these enzymes.
Step 5: Given the structural complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, the molecule may interact with several genes including ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, PTGS1, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4.
