Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring system and a sulfonamide group, which are common in many drugs that interact with receptors and transporters. This structure suggests potential interactions with genes involved in receptor function and drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a nitroimidazole group and a quinoline ring, along with the overall complex structure, indicates possible interactions with enzymes such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are known to metabolize various drugs including those targeting these enzymes.
Step 3: The molecule's structure also includes a benzene ring with a cyano group, which could indicate potential binding to proteins like CYP2D6, known for its role in drug metabolism.
Step 4: Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, the molecule may interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), suggesting potential interactions with genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, all of which code for GPCRs.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule's structure might influence signaling pathways involving kinases, potentially interacting with genes like LCK and PTGS1.
