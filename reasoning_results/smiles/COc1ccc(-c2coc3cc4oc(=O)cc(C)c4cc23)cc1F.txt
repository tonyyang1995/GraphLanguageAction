Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(-c2coc3cc4oc(=O)cc(C)c4cc23)cc1F, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a phenolic group (-OH) attached to a benzene ring, which is a common feature in many ligands that interact with receptors such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural pattern suggests potential interaction with receptors that have similar binding sites.
Step 2: The presence of an ester functional group (-COO-) indicates that the molecule could act as a ligand for enzymes or receptors that recognize this functional group, such as certain GPCRs or cholinergic receptors.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a fluoro substituent (-F), which can modulate receptor activity through various mechanisms, including allosteric modulation. Fluorine-containing compounds are known to interact with multiple receptor types, particularly GPCRs.
Step 4: Considering the structural features mentioned, the molecule might interact with receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), cholinergic receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), and cannabinoid receptors (CNR1).
Step 5: Additionally, due to the presence of an ester group, the molecule may also interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C19 and CYP2D6.
