Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(N)=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string (CC(N)=O) represents a molecule that is commonly known as Acetaminophen (Paracetamol). This molecule has a benzene ring, an amide group (-CONH2), and a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to it.
Step 2: Acetaminophen is metabolized primarily through the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, specifically CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are involved in Phase I metabolism. These enzymes convert acetaminophen into its toxic metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI).
Step 3: The toxicity of NAPQI is managed by conjugation with glutathione (GSH), a process mediated by the enzyme glutathione S-transferase (GST). GSTs are encoded by various genes, including those for GSTM1, GSTP1, and GSTT1, although none of the listed genes in the prompt directly correspond to GST enzymes.
Step 4: Among the listed genes, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 are closely related to the metabolism of acetaminophen. CYP2C9 is particularly relevant due to its role in the conversion of acetaminophen to NAPQI. Additionally, CYP2D6, another cytochrome P450 enzyme, may also play a minor role in the metabolism of acetaminophen, although it is not as significant as CYP2C9.
Step 5: The related gene names are CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These genes encode enzymes that are directly involved in the metabolic processes of acetaminophen, highlighting their relevance to the molecule's interaction with the body.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6 Step 5: Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2D6
These genes are involved in the metabolism of acetaminophen, specifically through the cytochrome P450 pathway. CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 are particularly important as they catalyze the initial steps in converting acetaminophen into its toxic metabolites. CYP2D6 also plays a role, albeit less significant, in the metabolism of this drug. The other listed genes do not have a direct relationship with the given molecule based on the provided information. Step 5: Summary of related gene names:
These genes are involved in the metabolism of acetaminophen, specifically through the cytochrome P450 pathway. CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 are particularly important as they catalyze the initial steps in converting acetaminophen into its toxic metabolites. CYP2D6 also plays a role, albeit less significant, in the metabolism of this drug. The other listed genes do
