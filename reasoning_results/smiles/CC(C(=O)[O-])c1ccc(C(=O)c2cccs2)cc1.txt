Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C(=O)[O-])c1ccc(C(=O)c2cccs2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a structure that includes a carboxyl group (-COOH), an amide group (-CONH2), and a negatively charged oxygen atom (-O-). This structure suggests the molecule could be an inhibitor or activator of enzymes that interact with these functional groups, such as kinases, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), or other proteins involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The molecule also contains a benzene ring with a sulfonyl group (-SO2NH2), which is characteristic of sulfonamides. Sulfonamides are known to inhibit certain enzymes, particularly dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), but not directly related to the listed genes. However, some of the listed genes are involved in signaling pathways that might be indirectly affected by this type of molecule.
Step 3: Among the listed genes, those involved in GPCR signaling pathways and neurotransmitter receptors may be more relevant due to the presence of aromatic rings and amine groups in the molecule. For example, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, and HTR2C encode for dopamine receptors and serotonin receptors, respectively, which are often targeted by drugs with similar chemical structures.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's ability to form hydrogen bonds and its overall shape might allow it to bind to and modulate the activity of kinases like CDK2, which is listed among the genes. Kinases are enzymes that transfer a phosphate group from a donor to a substrate, and they play crucial roles in cellular processes regulated by the listed genes.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structural features and potential interactions, the related genes are likely to be those involved in GPCR signaling pathways (e.g., DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C) and kinase regulation (e.g., CDK2).
Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- CDK2 Step 5: The molecule's structure and properties suggest potential interactions with several genes involved in GPCR signaling pathways and kinase regulation. Therefore, the related genes include DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and CDK2. These genes are highlighted due to their relevance to the molecule's possible mechanisms of action.
