Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc(C)n(-c2cc(N3CC[NH+](C(=O)c4ccc(C(C)(C)C)cc4)CC3)ccc2[N+](=O)[O-])n1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a quinoline ring system, which is characteristic of several drugs that interact with neurotransmitter receptors. This suggests potential interactions with genes encoding for receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmission.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-CONH2) indicates the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes such as cytochrome P450s (CYPs), which are encoded by CYP genes, or other proteins that interact with amides.
Step 3: The molecule has a nitrile group (-CN), which is often found in compounds that can act as inhibitors of enzymes like butyrylcholinesterase or other amidases, potentially affecting cholinergic pathways. Genes encoding for cholinergic receptors or enzymes might be related.
Step 4: The presence of a carboxylate group (-COO-) suggests the molecule could be an inhibitor of enzymes like monoamine oxidases (MAOs) or carbonic anhydrases (CA family), which are encoded by genes like CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CA12, CA2, CA9, and others.
Step 5: Given the complex structure with multiple functional groups, the molecule may interact with multiple targets, including G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels, which are encoded by genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, LCK, OPRK1, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4.
Related gene names:

- PTGS1
Note: Some of the genes listed are not directly related to the molecule based on the described structural features, but were included due to their involvement in neurotransmission or enzyme activity. A more precise analysis would narrow down the relevant genes.
