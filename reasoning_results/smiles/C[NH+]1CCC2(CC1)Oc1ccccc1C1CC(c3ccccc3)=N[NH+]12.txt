Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+]1CCC2(CC1)Oc1ccccc1C1CC(c3ccccc3)=N[NH+]12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring system, which is a common structural feature in many ligands that interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This pattern suggests potential interaction with receptors that have similar binding sites.
Step 2: The presence of a quaternary ammonium group (+NH3) indicates the molecule could act as an agonist or antagonist for certain receptors, particularly those that bind small cationic molecules. This feature points towards possible interactions with adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), cholinergic receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), and dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4).
Step 3: The molecule also includes a benzene ring system and a ketone group, which are often found in compounds that can modulate the activity of enzymes such as CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. These enzymes are involved in the metabolism of many drugs, suggesting the molecule might influence their function.
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule, including its aromatic and heterocyclic components, may allow it to form hydrogen bonds and other non-covalent interactions with proteins, which could lead to effects on various signaling pathways and receptors.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. These genes encode receptors and enzymes that could potentially interact directly or indirectly with the described molecular structure. 
Summary of related genes:
- ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2 (adrenergic receptors)
- CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4 (cholinergic receptors)
- DRD2, DRD3, DRD4 (dopaminergic receptors)
- CYP2D6, CYP3A4 (cytochrome P450 enzymes) Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring system, which is a common structural feature in many ligands that interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This pattern suggests potential interaction with receptors that have similar binding sites.
