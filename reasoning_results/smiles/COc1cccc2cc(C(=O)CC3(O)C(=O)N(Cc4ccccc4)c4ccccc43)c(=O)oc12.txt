Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cccc2cc(C(=O)CC3(O)C(=O)N(Cc4ccccc4)c4ccccc43)c(=O)oc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure containing aromatic rings, a pyrrole ring, and a carboxamide group. Notably, the presence of a carboxamide group suggests that this molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: Considering the potential for drug metabolism inhibition, we can narrow our focus to genes encoding enzymes involved in the cytochrome P450 (CYP) family, which are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics. Among the provided genes, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 are directly related to the CYP family.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule contains a quinolone-like structure, which is often found in ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This feature points towards potential interactions with genes encoding GPCRs. Among the provided genes, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which encode dopamine receptors, might be relevant due to their involvement in neurotransmission and drug response.
Step 4: The presence of a benzene ring and a pyrrole ring in the molecule also suggests possible interactions with other receptors, such as those encoded by HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are serotonin receptors. These receptors play crucial roles in mood regulation and are targets for several psychiatric medications.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the following genes are potentially related to the molecule: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C. These genes are involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmission, and receptor signaling pathways. 
Summary of Related Genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C.
