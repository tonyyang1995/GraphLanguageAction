Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1cc(-c2ccccc2)oc2cc([O-])cc([O-])c12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule has a core structure consisting of an oxo group (O=) connected to a benzene ring, with multiple substituents including another benzene ring, a lactone ring, and two negatively charged oxygen atoms (-O-). This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in signal transduction and receptor binding.
Step 2: The presence of aromatic rings and functional groups like the lactone ring indicate that the molecule could interact with receptors such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are often involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 3: The negatively charged oxygen atoms may suggest ion channel modulation, which could relate to genes encoding ion channels or transporters. This is supported by the presence of genes like KCNH2 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2).
Step 4: Given the complex structure and potential for receptor binding, genes involved in neurotransmitter signaling and receptor activity might be relevant. This includes genes such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which encode serotonin receptors.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and potential interactions, the molecule is likely related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, and SLC6A4. These genes are involved in receptor binding, signal transduction, and neurotransmitter metabolism.
