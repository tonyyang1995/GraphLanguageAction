Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc(OCCn2cc(C(N)=[NH+]O)c3ccccc32)ccc1Cl, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule has several functional groups including an amine group (-NH2), an alcohol group (-OH), a ketone group (C=O), and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The presence of these functional groups suggests that the molecule could potentially interact with proteins that have binding sites for such groups.
Step 2: Among the given genes, several are involved in neurotransmitter receptors and transporters, which often have binding sites for small molecules. Notably, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 are serotonin receptor genes. Serotonin receptors typically bind to small molecules, making them potential targets for the described functional groups in the molecule.
Step 3: Additionally, CYP2D6, which encodes a cytochrome P450 enzyme involved in drug metabolism, might be relevant if the molecule is a substrate or inhibitor of this enzyme. The presence of aromatic rings and nitrogen-containing heterocycles in the molecule could suggest it may interact with enzymes like CYP2D6.
Step 4: Given the complexity of the molecule and its various functional groups, it is also possible that the molecule could interact with ion channels. For instance, KCNH2 encodes a potassium channel subunit, which could interact with molecules that modulate ion channel activity.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the related genes include: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2D6, and KCNH2.
Summary of related gene names: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2D6, KCNH2.
