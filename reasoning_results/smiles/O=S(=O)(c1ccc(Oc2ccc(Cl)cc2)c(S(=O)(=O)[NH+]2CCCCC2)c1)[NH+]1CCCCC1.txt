Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=S(=O)(c1ccc(Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2)c(S(=O)(=O)[NH+]2CCCCC2)c1)[NH+]1CCCCC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) and a pyridine ring, which are common in many drugs that interact with enzymes and receptors involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a pyridine ring suggests potential interactions with enzymes like CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs including those containing this functional group.
Step 3: The molecule also has a quinoline-like structure, which could indicate potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, known to be involved in neurotransmission.
Step 4: The overall structure, including the presence of a carboxylic acid group and aromatic rings, might suggest potential interactions with ion channels or transporters, possibly involving SLC6A2 and SLC6A4, which are known for their roles in the reuptake of neurotransmitters.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and potential interactions, the related genes include: CYP2D6, CYP2C19, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, SLC6A2, SLC6A4. These genes are involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmission, and ion transport. 
Related Genes: CYP2D6, CYP2C19, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
