Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=[N+]([O-])c1ccc2c(c1[NH2+]C1CCCCC1)=NC1(CCCCC1)[N+]=2O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains several functional groups such as an amide (-CONH2), a nitrile (CN), and a carbonyl (C=O) group. These functional groups are often involved in interactions with proteins that have specific binding sites for these structures. Notably, the presence of a nitrile and amide group suggests potential interaction with enzymes or receptors that recognize these motifs.
Step 2: Among the listed genes, those involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmitter systems, and receptor signaling are likely to interact with this molecule due to its chemical structure. Specifically, genes encoding enzymes like CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4, which are involved in phase I metabolism of drugs, could potentially metabolize or be affected by this molecule.
Step 3: Genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are also relevant because the molecule’s structure might fit into their binding pockets. For example, DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2) and HTR2A (serotonin receptor 5-HT2A) could have potential interactions with this molecule as they both contain ligand-binding domains that can accommodate various small molecules.
Step 4: Additionally, genes encoding ion channels such as KCNH2 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2) might be related if the molecule interacts with these channels through its chemical structure. This interaction could modulate the function of the channel, affecting ion flow across the cell membrane.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and the potential interactions with specific functional groups, the related genes include: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, and KCNH2.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, KCNH2.
