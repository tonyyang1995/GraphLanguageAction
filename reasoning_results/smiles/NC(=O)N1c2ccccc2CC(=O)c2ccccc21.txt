Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NC(=O)N1c2ccccc2CC(=O)c2ccccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule has a core structure consisting of a benzene ring with a carboxamide group (-CONH-) attached to it, and another benzene ring connected through a carbon chain with an amide group (-CONH-). This structure is reminiscent of certain ligands that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: GPCRs are known to be activated by small molecules and ions, and their function is crucial for various physiological processes, including neurotransmission, hormone action, and sensory perception. The presence of multiple amide groups suggests potential binding to GPCRs, particularly those that recognize similar functional groups.
Step 3: Among the listed genes, several are associated with GPCRs. These include CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, all of which encode for different subtypes of GPCRs that respond to acetylcholine, adrenergic agonists, and serotonin, respectively.
Step 4: The molecule’s pattern of having multiple amide groups could potentially allow it to bind to these GPCRs, modulating their activity. For example, it might act as an agonist or antagonist depending on its chemical properties and the specific receptor it binds to.
Step 5: Therefore, the related genes to this molecule are: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6. 
Summary of related gene names: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
