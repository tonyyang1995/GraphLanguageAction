Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1nnc2sc(C(=O)NCc3ccc(S(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F)cc3)c(N)c2c1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups such as a nitro group (N), sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)), and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). These functional groups suggest that the molecule may have pharmacological activity, particularly related to interactions with receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: Upon closer inspection, the presence of the sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)) and the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) indicates that this molecule could be a ligand for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) or an inhibitor of certain enzymes. This is because sulfonyl groups are often found in ligands for GPCRs, while carboxylic acids can act as inhibitors of enzymes like cytochrome P450s.
Step 3: Given the potential for interaction with GPCRs, we can consider genes encoding for receptors that belong to the GPCR family. From the provided list, several GPCRs are present: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These receptors are known to interact with various ligands and modulators, making them potential targets for the described molecule.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of the carboxylic acid group suggests that the molecule might interact with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These enzymes are part of the cytochrome P450 family and play crucial roles in drug metabolism.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These genes encode for receptors and enzymes that could potentially interact with the described molecule based on its structural features.
