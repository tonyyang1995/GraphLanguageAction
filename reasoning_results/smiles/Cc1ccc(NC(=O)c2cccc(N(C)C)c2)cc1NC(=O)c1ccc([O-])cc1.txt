Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(NC(=O)c2cccc(N(C)C)c2)cc1NC(=O)c1ccc([O-])cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a number of functional groups such as amides (N-C=O), nitriles (C#N), and aromatic rings (c-c), which are common in drugs that interact with receptors and enzymes. These features suggest potential interactions with proteins involved in signal transduction and metabolic pathways.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of a nitrogen atom within an amide group (NC(=O)) and the overall structure of the molecule hint at possible binding to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are known to be associated with various neurotransmitters and hormones, and they play crucial roles in signaling pathways involving multiple genes such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode for serotonin receptors.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a nitrile group and the aromatic structure may indicate potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, specifically those encoded by genes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are part of the cytochrome P450 family.
Step 4: The molecule also includes a carboxylate group (-COO-) and a phosphate group (-PO4), suggesting it could interact with ion channels or transporters. This feature might be relevant to genes such as KCNH2, which encodes for a potassium channel, and SLC6A4, which codes for a sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to have interactions with the following genes: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, KCNH2, and SLC6A4. These genes are involved in neurotransmission, drug metabolism, and ion channel function, respectively.
