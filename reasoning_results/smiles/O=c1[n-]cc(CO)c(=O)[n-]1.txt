Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1[n-]cc(CO)c(=O)[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The SMILES string provided (O=c1[n-]cc(CO)c(=O)[n-]1) represents a molecule that is a derivative of nicotine, specifically a cyclic nitrosamine compound. This structure contains a nitrogen-nitrogen double bond (N=N), indicating it is a potent and well-known tobacco-specific carcinogen.
Step 2: The molecule's structure suggests potential interactions with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which are ligand-gated ion channels activated by acetylcholine but also by nicotine. These receptors are involved in various physiological processes including muscle contraction, neurotransmission, and behavior. Given the structural similarity to nicotine, this molecule could interact with nAChRs.
Step 3: Among the listed genes, several are directly related to nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits. Specifically, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4 encode for different subunits of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, which are distinct from nAChRs. However, the primary focus should be on the nAChR-related genes due to the structural similarity to nicotine.
Step 4: The molecule may also interact with DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which encode dopamine receptors. Dopamine receptors are known to interact with various ligands, and while nicotine primarily activates nAChRs, there is some evidence of cross-talk between nAChRs and dopamine systems.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the molecule is likely to have significant interactions with CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4. These genes are involved in the regulation of neurotransmission and may be affected by the presence of the cyclic nitrosamine compound.
