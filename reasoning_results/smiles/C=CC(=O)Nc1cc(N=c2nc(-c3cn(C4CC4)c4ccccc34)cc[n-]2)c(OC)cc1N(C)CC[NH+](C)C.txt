Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C=CC(=O)Nc1cc(N=c2nc(-c3cn(C4CC4)c4ccccc34)cc[n-]2)c(OC)cc1N(C)CC[NH+](C)C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a carboxamide group (-CO-NH-) and a nitrogen atom with a positive charge. This structure is characteristic of certain inhibitors of CYP enzymes, particularly CYP2D6.
Step 2: CYP2D6 is an enzyme involved in the metabolism of various drugs, including some that interact with neurotransmitter systems such as dopamine. The presence of a positively charged nitrogen and a carboxamide group suggests potential interaction with this enzyme.
Step 3: The molecule also has a quinoline ring system, which is known to interact with certain receptors, notably D2-like dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4). These receptors are involved in multiple physiological processes, including reward and motivation.
Step 4: The presence of a benzene ring with substituents like the quinoline and the carboxamide group indicates potential interactions with other G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as adrenergic (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic cholinergic receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 5: The molecule's overall structure and functional groups suggest it could be a ligand for several receptors and enzymes, including those involved in the dopaminergic pathway (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) and the cytochrome P450 family (CYP2D6).
