Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)[O-] appears to be a linear alkane chain with a carboxylate group attached at one end. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins that bind to or metabolize fatty acids or lipids.
Step 2: Given the presence of a carboxylate group, this molecule could interact with genes involved in lipid metabolism and signaling pathways. For example, genes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are known to be involved in the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics, which often include carboxylated compounds.
Step 3: The linear nature of the alkane chain might also suggest potential interactions with genes encoding for receptors or transporters that recognize and bind to long-chain fatty acids or similar molecules. Genes such as SLC6A4 (norepinephrine transporter) and CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4 (muscarinic acetylcholine receptors) could be relevant here due to their involvement in neurotransmitter transport and signaling.
Step 4: Considering the potential for interaction with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, genes like CYP3A4, CYP1A2, and CYP2D6 are likely candidates. These genes encode enzymes that play a crucial role in the biotransformation of many pharmaceuticals and xenobiotics.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the related genes are: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP1A2, SLC6A4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4.
