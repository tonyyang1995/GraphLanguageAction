Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc2ncc(-c3ccccc3)nc2cc1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with multiple nitrogen atoms, indicating it could be an amine or amide derivative. This structural feature is relevant to enzymes involved in drug metabolism such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 2: The presence of a tricyclic structure and a pyrrole ring suggests potential interactions with receptors like adrenergic (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and dopaminergic (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) receptors.
Step 3: The molecule's aromatic nature and possible basicity due to nitrogen atoms may influence its binding to ion channels, particularly calcium channels (CACNA1H) and potassium channels (KCNH2).
Step 4: The presence of a quinoline-like structure indicates potential interactions with enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways, such as EGFR and PTGS1.
Step 5: Given the complexity and specific functional groups, this molecule might interact with multiple genes, including CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, EGFR, PTGS1, and KCNH2.
