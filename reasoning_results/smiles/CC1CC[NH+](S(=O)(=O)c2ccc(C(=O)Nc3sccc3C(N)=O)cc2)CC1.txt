Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC1CC[NH+](S(=O)(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)Nc3sccc3C(N)=O)cc2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule, which includes an amide group (-NH-COO), a sulfonate ester group (S(=O)(=O)), and several aromatic rings. The presence of these functional groups suggests that the molecule could be involved in interactions with proteins that have binding sites for similar functional groups.
Step 2: Considering the presence of the sulfonate ester group, this molecule might interact with proteins that contain binding sites for sulfonate esters. One such protein is CYP2C9, which is involved in the metabolism of various drugs and has a sulfonamide-binding site.
Step 3: Additionally, the amide group in the molecule may interact with proteins that have amide-binding sites. CYP2D6, which metabolizes numerous drugs including amides, is a potential candidate.
Step 4: Given the complexity of the molecule and its functional groups, it is likely to interact with multiple proteins rather than just one. However, based on the specific features identified, CYP2C9 and CYP2D6 are the most relevant genes due to their involvement in drug metabolism and their structural compatibility with the molecule’s functional groups.
Step 5: Therefore, the related genes are CYP2C9 and CYP2D6.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6 Step 5: Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2D6
These genes are directly related to the molecule due to their involvement in drug metabolism and structural compatibility with the molecule's functional groups. Other genes listed do not have a direct or clear relationship with the specific features of this molecule.
