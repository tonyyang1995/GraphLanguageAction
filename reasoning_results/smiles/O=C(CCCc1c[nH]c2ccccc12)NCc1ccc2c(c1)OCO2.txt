Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(CCCc1c[nH]c2ccccc12)NCc1ccc2c(c1)OCO2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound with a structure that includes a benzene ring (represented by "c1c[nH]c2ccccc12"), a carboxylic acid group (O=C), and an amine group (NC). The presence of these functional groups suggests that the molecule could interact with proteins that have similar chemical moieties, such as receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The benzene ring in the molecule is characteristic of many drug-like molecules, which often bind to protein targets through interactions with aromatic residues. This feature might allow the molecule to interact with membrane-bound receptors, particularly G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that typically have hydrophobic binding pockets.
Step 3: The carboxylic acid group (O=C) and the amine group (NC) are both common in ligands for ion channels and transporters. The carboxylic acid group can form hydrogen bonds, while the amine group can participate in both hydrogen bonding and salt-bridge formation. These interactions suggest potential binding sites for various membrane proteins, including ion channels and transporters.
Step 4: Given the potential interactions with GPCRs and ion channels/transporters, we can infer that the molecule might be related to genes encoding for these types of proteins. Specific examples include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, and SIGMAR1, all of which are involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related gene names are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, and SIGMAR1. These genes encode proteins that are involved in the modulation of neurotransmitter activity and signaling, which is consistent with the proposed interactions of the molecule with these proteins.
