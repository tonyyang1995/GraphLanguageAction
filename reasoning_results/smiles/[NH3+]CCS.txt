Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [NH3+]CCS, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string [NH3+]CCS represents a molecule that consists of a positively charged nitrogen atom (indicated by [NH3+]) attached to a benzene ring (CC) and a thiophene ring (S). This molecular structure suggests the presence of both aromatic and heteroaromatic functionalities.
Step 2: The positively charged nitrogen and the presence of aromatic rings can indicate potential interactions with proteins involved in ion transport, receptor binding, and signaling pathways. These functional groups are common in molecules that interact with receptors or ion channels, which are encoded by several genes listed.
Step 3: The thiophene ring in the molecule may suggest a relationship with genes involved in drug metabolism or transport, as thiophene derivatives are known to be metabolized by enzymes such as CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, which are listed among the genes.
Step 4: Considering the aromatic nature of the molecule and its possible interactions with receptors or ion channels, it could be related to genes encoding for receptors such as DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, CHRM1, etc., which are involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction.
Step 5: The molecule’s potential for metabolic interactions and receptor binding implies a connection to genes involved in drug metabolism (like CYP2C19, CYP2D6) and neurotransmission (like DRD2, HTR2A).
