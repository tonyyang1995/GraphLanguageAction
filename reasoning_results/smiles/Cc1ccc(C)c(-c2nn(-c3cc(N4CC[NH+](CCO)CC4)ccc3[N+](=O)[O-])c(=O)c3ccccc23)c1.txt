Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(C)c(-c2nn(-c3cc(N4CC[NH+](CCO)CC4)ccc3[N+](=O)[O-])c(=O)c3ccccc23)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule, which appears to be a benzodiazepine derivative. This type of compound typically interacts with GABA-A receptors, which are encoded by several genes including GABRA1 (which encodes the alpha subunit), GABRB1 (beta subunit), and GABRG1 (gamma subunit). However, none of the provided genes directly encode for GABA-A receptors.
Step 2: The molecule contains a quinoline ring system, which is often found in drugs that interact with adrenergic receptors. Specifically, it has substituents like methyl and amide groups, which could potentially bind to adrenergic receptors such as those encoded by ADRA1D, ADRA2B, and ADRB2.
Step 3: The presence of a pyridine ring with nitrogen and oxygen functionalities suggests potential interactions with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which are encoded by CHRNA and CHRNB genes. However, the provided list does not include any of these specific genes.
Step 4: The molecule also contains a pyrazole ring, which is characteristic of certain inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes, specifically CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. These enzymes are involved in drug metabolism and are listed in the provided gene list.
Step 5: Given the structural features and the potential interactions with known pharmacophores, the most likely related genes from the provided list are CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 due to their involvement in drug metabolism and the presence of functional groups typical of CYP substrates.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19.
