Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccccc1CN1C(=O)C2=C(CC[NH+](Cc3ccccc3)C2)N2CC[NH+]=C12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex molecule that contains several functional groups such as aromatic rings, amide, and amine functionalities. Notably, the molecule has a quinoline-like core with a nitrogen atom that forms an amide bond with a carboxamide group. This structural feature suggests potential interactions with proteins that have similar binding sites or pharmacophores.
Step 2: The presence of an amine group (NH+) and a carboxamide group in the molecule could indicate it is an agonist or inhibitor of receptors or enzymes that have these functional groups as binding sites. For instance, some neurotransmitter receptors, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), and ion channels might interact with this molecule due to the presence of these groups.
Step 3: Considering the neurotransmitter receptor family, the molecule might interact with receptors that have amine or amide binding sites, such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6). These receptors are involved in various physiological processes including mood regulation, pain perception, and cardiovascular functions.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule’s structure could also suggest potential interactions with enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are known to metabolize many drugs. Interactions with these enzymes could affect drug efficacy and metabolism.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. These genes encode proteins that are potential targets for the molecule due to their binding sites and functional roles in the body.
