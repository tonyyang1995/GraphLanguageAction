Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[N+](C)(C)CC#CC[NH+]1CCCC1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this relationship matters.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with positive charge, which is part of a pyrrolidine ring (N+). This positively charged nitrogen could interact with negatively charged residues in protein binding sites.
Step 2: The molecule has a benzene ring (C6H6) with a positive charge attached to it, indicating potential for aromatic interactions and hydrogen bonding.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a quinoline-like structure (C8H7N), which may allow for hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions.
Step 4: Given the presence of aromatic rings and the overall structure, the molecule could potentially bind to receptors such as GPCRs (G protein-coupled receptors) and ion channels, which are often involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and potential binding sites, the molecule might be related to genes encoding receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2D6, and CYP2C9.
