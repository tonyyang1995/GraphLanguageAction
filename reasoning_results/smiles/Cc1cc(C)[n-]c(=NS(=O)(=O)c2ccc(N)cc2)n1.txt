Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc(C)[n-]c(=NS(=O)(=O)c2ccc(N)cc2)n1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples or extra instructions.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring, which is part of the nitrile group (-CN) attached to a sulfur atom that is double-bonded to an oxygen atom (S(=O)(=O)). This structure is characteristic of molecules that can interact with certain G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrile group and the overall structure suggest potential interactions with adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), as these receptors often bind small molecules with similar functional groups.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a thiosemicarbazone moiety, which is known to inhibit certain cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2D6. This indicates a possible interaction with the CYP2D6 gene, which encodes a key enzyme in drug metabolism.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH-) suggests potential interactions with serine/threonine kinases like CDK2, which are involved in cell cycle regulation, or with GPCRs like HTR2A and HTR2C, which are involved in neurotransmission.
Step 5: The overall structure does not strongly suggest direct interactions with other genes listed, such as ABCB1, ABL1, or EGFR, but it could potentially modulate signaling pathways involving these proteins indirectly through receptor activation or inhibition.
Summary of related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2D6, CDK2, HTR2A, HTR2C.
