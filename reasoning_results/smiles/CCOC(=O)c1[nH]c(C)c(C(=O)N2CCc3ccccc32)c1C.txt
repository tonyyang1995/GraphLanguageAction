Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)c1[nH]c(C)c(C(=O)N2CCc3ccccc32)c1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure that includes an aromatic ring system, a carboxylic acid group, and a heterocyclic amine moiety. This structure suggests the molecule may have potential interactions with proteins involved in signaling pathways or enzymatic activities.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (COOH) indicates the molecule could be an inhibitor or substrate for enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics. These enzymes are listed in the provided gene list.
Step 3: The aromatic ring system and heterocyclic amine moiety might interact with receptors such as adrenergic (ADRA1D, ADRA2B) and dopaminergic (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) receptors, which are also present in the gene list. These receptors are involved in neurotransmission and can be modulated by molecules with similar structures.
Step 4: The molecule's structure also hints at potential interactions with ion channels and transporters. For instance, the heterocyclic amine could potentially interact with voltage-gated sodium channels like KCNH2, which is listed among the genes. Additionally, the carboxylic acid group might influence the activity of transporters such as SLC6A2 and SLC6A4, which are also included in the gene list.
Step 5: Given the structure and potential interactions described, the related genes include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, KCNH2, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4.
