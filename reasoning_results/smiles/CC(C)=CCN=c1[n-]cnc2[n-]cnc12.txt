Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)=CCN=c1[n-]cnc2[n-]cnc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a benzene ring system with a double bond (C=C) and a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic group (N-cyclopropyl). This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as cytochrome P450s (CYP enzymes), which are known to metabolize drugs and other xenobiotics.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the heterocyclic group could indicate the possibility of interaction with receptors that bind to nitrogen-containing ligands, such as adrenergic and cholinergic receptors. This is supported by the presence of adrenergic (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and cholinergic (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4) receptor genes in the list.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a nitrile group (-CN), which might interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize nitriles and other electrophilic compounds.
Step 4: Given the overall structure and functional groups, this molecule could potentially interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to its size and hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance. GPCRs are involved in various signaling pathways and are associated with several genes like HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, all of which are present in the provided list.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule may be related to the metabolism and signaling pathways regulated by the following genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
