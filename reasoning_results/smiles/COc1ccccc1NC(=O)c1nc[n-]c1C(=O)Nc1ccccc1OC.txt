Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccccc1NC(=O)c1nc[n-]c1C(=O)Nc1ccccc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure including aromatic rings, amide groups, and a pyrrole ring. Notably, it contains a benzene ring, an amide group (-CONH-), and a nitrogen atom in a pyrrole ring.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in cell signaling pathways, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs often bind to small molecules that contain aromatic rings.
Step 3: The amide group could interact with enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYPs) due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds and participate in conjugation reactions. CYP enzymes are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 4: The nitrogen in the pyrrole ring might contribute to the molecule's interaction with ion channels or receptors that have basic binding sites. For instance, the pyrrole ring could be involved in forming hydrogen bonds or stacking interactions with protein residues.
Step 5: Based on these structural features, the molecule may be related to several genes involved in drug metabolism and receptor interactions, including CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
