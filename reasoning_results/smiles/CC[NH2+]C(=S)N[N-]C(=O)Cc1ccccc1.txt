Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC[NH2+]C(=S)N[N-]C(=O)Cc1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this might be clinically relevant.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring (N-H) and a sulfonamide group (-S=), which are common in ligands that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes. This suggests potential interaction with genes encoding GPCRs and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH2) and a carbonyl group (-C=O) indicates the molecule could be a modulator of ion channels or kinases, which are encoded by genes such as KCNH2 and CDK2.
Step 3: The aromatic ring system and the presence of a benzene ring (c1ccccc1) suggest the molecule may interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4.
Step 4: The presence of a quinoline-like structure (as seen in the representation of CYP2D6) and a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (NH2+) indicate potential interactions with neurotransmitter receptors like DRD2, HTR2A, and HTR2B.
Step 5: Given the complexity and functional groups present, the molecule likely interacts with multiple targets, including those encoded by genes such as ABL1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CNR1, ESR1, FLT1, HRH1, KDR, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, PTGS1, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4.
