Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC[NH+](CC)CC[NH+](Cc1ccc(-c2ccc(C(F)(F)F)cc2)cc1)C(=O)Cn1c(SCc2ccc(F)cc2)nc(=O)c2c1CCC2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains multiple amide groups (-NHCO-) and a positively charged nitrogen atom, suggesting it may act as an agonist or modulator of receptors that bind to these functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of fluorine atoms (F) and a phenolic group (C(=O)O-) indicates potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 3: The molecule includes a quinoline-like structure (quinoline ring), which could interact with proteins involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways, potentially affecting ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C.
Step 4: The presence of a benzene ring and carboxylic acid group might suggest interactions with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, possibly affecting EGFR, PTGS1, and KDR.
Step 5: The overall structure suggests potential binding to ion channels, such as KCNH2, which could be related to HRH1 and LCK through their roles in neuronal signaling.
