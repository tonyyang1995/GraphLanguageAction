Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)[NH+]1CC[NH+](S(=O)(=O)Cc2ccccc2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a structure that includes a benzene ring, an amide group (-CONH2), and a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2). This indicates the molecule likely interacts with proteins involved in signal transduction, transport, and metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and a sulfonamide group suggests potential interactions with enzymes such as CYP (Cytochrome P450) enzymes, which are known to metabolize drugs and other xenobiotics. CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 are particularly relevant due to their role in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The amide group in the molecule could indicate potential interactions with receptors or ion channels. For example, CYP enzymes and certain G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like HTR2A (serotonin receptor) and DRD2 (dopamine receptor) have amide groups in their structures.
Step 4: The presence of a quinoline-like structure (indicated by the pattern [NH+]1CC[NH+]) suggests possible interactions with enzymes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism, such as CYP1A2, which is involved in the metabolism of various neurotransmitters and psychoactive substances.
Step 5: Given the complexity of the molecule and its potential to interact with multiple targets, it is likely to influence several pathways involving neurotransmission, receptor signaling, and metabolic processes. Genes directly related to these functions include CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, and PTGS1 (COX-2).
