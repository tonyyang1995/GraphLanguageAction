Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(NC(=O)c2ccc(C(=[NH2+])N(C)C)cc2)c(C(=O)N=c2ccc(Cl)c[n-]2)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings, including a pyrrole ring (N), a benzene ring (c), and a pyridine ring (c). Additionally, it contains functional groups such as an amide (-CONH), ester (-COO), and a nitrile group (-CN). These features suggest the molecule may be involved in interactions with proteins that have binding sites for similar functional groups.
Step 2: Considering the presence of a nitrile group (-CN) and the overall complexity of the molecule, it is likely to interact with enzymes or receptors that have known binding sites for nitriles or similar chemical functionalities. One such enzyme is CYP2D6, which is known to metabolize drugs containing nitrile groups. 
Step 3: The presence of an amide (-CONH) and ester (-COO) suggests the molecule could potentially interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that have binding sites for amides and esters. GPCRs are involved in various signaling pathways and are targets for many drugs. Examples of relevant GPCRs include DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), HTR1A (Serotonin receptor 1A), and HTR2A (Serotonin receptor 2A).
Step 4: Given the complexity and potential pharmacological activity of the molecule, it may also interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP enzymes. This includes CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize a wide range of drugs.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR1A, and HTR2A.
