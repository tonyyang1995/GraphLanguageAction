Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Nc1[n-]c(=Nc2ccccc2)sc1C(=O)c1ccc(F)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a pyrrole ring system, which is part of the core structure. This is relevant to the CYP (cytochrome P450) family of enzymes, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs, including those that might interact with CYP enzymes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a phenyl ring with a fluorine substituent, which could potentially interact with receptors such as the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (MChRs), specifically M3 (CHRM3) and M4 (CHRM4). These receptors are known to be modulated by various drugs and ligands.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a nitrile group (-CN) and a carboxamide group (-CONH2) suggests potential interactions with enzymes or receptors involved in neurotransmission, such as the G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like HTR2A and HTR2B, which are involved in serotonin signaling.
Step 4: The molecule's overall structure, particularly the presence of aromatic rings and polar functional groups, indicates it may have affinity for ion channels or transporters. For instance, it could interact with voltage-gated sodium channels like KCNH2, or with GPCRs like HTR6, which is another serotonin receptor.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule appears to have potential interactions with several genes involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6), neurotransmission (HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR6), and ion channel function (KCNH2).
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP1A2
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR6
- KCNH2 Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring, which is a common feature in substrates for cytochrome P450 enzymes. This suggests potential interactions with CYP enzymes.
Step 2: The phenyl ring with a fluorine substituent is a characteristic that can interact with muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, particularly M3 (CHRM3) and M4 (CHRM4).
Step 3: The presence of a nitrile group and a carboxamide group indicates the molecule may affect G-protein coupled receptors, such as HTR2A and HTR2B, which are involved in serotonin signaling.
Step 4: The aromatic rings and polar functional groups suggest possible interactions with ion channels, like KCNH2, which is a voltage-gated potassium channel.
Step 5: Based on these structural features, the molecule is likely to interact with CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR2A, HTR2B, and KCNH2. Summary of related gene names:
