Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)c1ccc(Cn2ccc3c4c(=N)[n-]c(=NC5CC5)[n-]c4ccc32)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this information may be useful.
Step 1: The molecule contains a complex structure with multiple rings, including benzene rings and a heterocyclic ring (indicated by 'n' in the SMILES string). This complexity suggests potential interactions with various biological targets.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom within a ring system, along with the presence of a nitro group (-N=), indicates possible binding to proteins involved in neurotransmission or receptor modulation. This could relate to genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a quinolone-like structure, which is known to interact with enzymes such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms. This suggests a potential interaction with genes involved in drug metabolism, specifically CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 4: The presence of a benzothiazole ring and a pyridine ring in the molecule may indicate interactions with receptors or enzymes that are part of the adrenergic and dopaminergic systems. This could be relevant to genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
Step 5: Given the overall structure and functional groups present, the molecule is likely to have interactions with genes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism and signaling, as well as genes related to drug metabolism. Therefore, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4. Step 5: Summary of related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
