Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: c1ccc2c(CC3=[NH+]CCN3)cccc2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is characteristic of many drugs that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This suggests potential interactions with genes encoding for such receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the benzene ring system, possibly forming an amide or an imine, indicates a potential interaction with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP enzymes.
Step 3: The molecule has a cyclic amine group (-N=), which is a common functional group found in ligands for receptors like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are dopamine receptors.
Step 4: The overall structure includes a quinoline-like motif, which could be recognized by certain metabolic enzymes like CYP2D6.
Step 5: Based on the structural features identified, the molecule is likely to be related to genes involved in dopamine signaling (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) and drug metabolism (CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19).
