Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with multiple rings and functional groups, including aromatic rings, amine groups, and a nitro group. This structure suggests the molecule could have various biological activities depending on its interactions with different proteins and enzymes.
Step 2: Analyzing the molecular structure, it contains potential sites for binding to receptors and enzymes that are often involved in signal transduction pathways and metabolism. For instance, the presence of amine groups and aromatic rings might allow for interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are encoded by genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule's structure may also interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics. This interaction is relevant to genes encoding these enzymes.
Step 4: Given the complexity and specific functional groups present in the molecule, it could also potentially interact with ion channels and transporters, such as KCNH2 and SLC6A4, respectively. These interactions would be pertinent to the genes KCNH2 and SLC6A4.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related genes to this molecule include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, KCNH2, and SLC6A4.
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, KCNH2, SLC6A4.
