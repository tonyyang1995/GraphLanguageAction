Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule has a thioether group (-S-) and a positively charged amine group ([NH3+]), which suggests it could interact with proteins that have binding sites for such functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring (CCc1cc) indicates potential for aromatic interactions, which are common in ligand-receptor binding sites.
Step 3: The nitrogen atom in the amine group could form hydrogen bonds, which might be important for binding to proteins like receptors or enzymes.
Step 4: Given the molecular structure, this compound may interact with proteins involved in neurotransmitter signaling, given its possible binding to receptors and enzymes.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and interactions described, the molecule is likely to be related to genes encoding neurotransmitter receptors and enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, and CYP2D6.
