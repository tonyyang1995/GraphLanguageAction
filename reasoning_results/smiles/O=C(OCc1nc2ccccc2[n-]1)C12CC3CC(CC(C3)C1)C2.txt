Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(OCc1nc2ccccc2[n-]1)C12CC3CC(CC(C3)C1)C2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that includes functional groups such as carbonyl (C=O), amide (C-N), and aromatic rings (c1ccccc1). The presence of a carbonyl group suggests potential interactions with proteins containing carboxylate binding sites, which could be relevant for certain receptor proteins.
Step 2: Analyzing the molecular structure further, we see the presence of nitrogen atoms within aromatic rings, indicating basicity and possible interactions with acidic residues in protein binding sites. This is particularly relevant for receptors that have acidic patches or pockets where basic molecules can bind.
Step 3: Considering the pattern of functional groups and the overall shape of the molecule, it resembles ligands that can interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are known to be involved in signal transduction pathways and are regulated by various neurotransmitters and hormones. The molecule’s structure aligns well with the binding sites of several GPCRs listed among the genes provided.
Step 4: Given the similarity in structure to GPCR ligands, the molecule could potentially interact with receptors like HTR1A (serotonin 1A receptor), HTR2A (serotonin 2A receptor), and HTR2B (serotonin 2B receptor), all of which are part of the provided list of genes. These receptors play crucial roles in neurotransmission and mood regulation.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related genes are likely to be those encoding for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways. Therefore, the list of related genes includes: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
Summary of related genes:
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- HTR6 Step 5: Summary of related genes:
- HTR6
These genes encode serotonin receptors, which are involved in various physiological processes including mood regulation, pain perception, and cognition. The molecule's structure appears to be compatible with binding to these receptors based on its functional groups and overall shape. Therefore, the focus is on the serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6). No other genes from the provided list show a clear structural or functional relationship with the given molecule. 
These genes encode serotonin receptors, which are directly related to the molecule's potential interaction due to its structural characteristics. The other genes listed do not have a clear direct relationship with the molecule based on the provided information.
