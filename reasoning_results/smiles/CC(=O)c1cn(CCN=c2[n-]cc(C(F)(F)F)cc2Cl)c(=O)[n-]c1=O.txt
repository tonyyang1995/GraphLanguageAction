Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(=O)c1cn(CCN=c2[n-]cc(C(F)(F)F)cc2Cl)c(=O)[n-]c1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a cyano group (-CN) and a phenylacetyl moiety (C(=O)c1cn), which suggests it may interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C19 and CYP2D6.
Step 2: The molecule also has fluorine substituents (F(F)(F)F) attached to a benzene ring, which might influence its pharmacokinetic properties and could potentially interact with transporters like SLC6A4.
Step 3: The presence of an amide group (C(=O)[n-]c1=O) indicates that the molecule could be an agonist or antagonist for receptors, possibly affecting G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 4: The overall structure includes a quinolone-like scaffold, which is known to interact with enzymes like CYP3A4 and may have effects on neurotransmitter receptors such as HTR2A and HTR2B.
Step 5: Given the complex structure and potential interactions with multiple systems, the most likely related genes are CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, SLC6A4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR2A, and HTR2B. 
Summary: Related genes include CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, SLC6A4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR2A, and HTR2B.
