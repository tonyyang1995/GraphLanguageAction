Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule, represented by the SMILES string NC(=O)OCC(COC(N)=O)c1ccccc1, is a complex organic compound containing a central carbon atom (C) surrounded by various functional groups such as an amide group (-CONH-), a phenyl ring (c1ccccc1), and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This structure suggests that it could be involved in interactions with proteins that bind to or are influenced by these functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-CONH-) in the molecule indicates potential interactions with enzymes or receptors that recognize or are activated by amides. This feature might relate to genes encoding proteins with amide-binding sites, such as certain G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) which are known to interact with small molecules and peptides.
Step 3: The phenyl ring (c1ccccc1) in the molecule could suggest interactions with proteins that have aromatic binding pockets. Genes such as those encoding GPCRs, ion channels, and transporters often have regions that specifically bind to aromatic compounds. For instance, genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, and CACNA1H encode proteins with such binding sites.
Step 4: The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) might indicate the molecule could interact with proteins that have acidic binding sites, such as certain ion channels or transporters. Genes like SLC6A2, SLC6A4, and KCNH2 could be relevant here, as they encode proteins that interact with acidic compounds.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and the functional groups present, the molecule is likely to be related to the genes that encode proteins involved in neurotransmitter signaling and metabolism, as well as those that regulate cellular responses to chemical stimuli. Therefore, the related gene names include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, CACNA1H, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, KCNH2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, LCK, and OPRL1 (OPRK1).
