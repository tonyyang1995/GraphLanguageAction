Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC1=CC(=O)[N-]S(=O)(=O)O1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a benzene ring system with a double bond, an amide group, a sulfonate ester, and an oxygen atom attached to it. This complex structure suggests that the molecule could interact with proteins involved in various biological processes such as signal transduction, metabolism, and receptor binding.
Step 2: The presence of a sulfonate ester (-SO3-) and an amide (-CONH-) group in the molecule indicates potential interactions with enzymes that metabolize these functional groups, such as those involved in phase I and II drug metabolism pathways. CYP (Cytochrome P450) enzymes, particularly CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, are known to be involved in the metabolism of sulfonates and amides.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a nitrogen atom with a negative charge, which might allow for interaction with ion channels or receptors that have positively charged binding sites. For example, the molecule could potentially bind to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) like HTR2A (serotonin 5-HT2A receptor), HTR2B (serotonin 5-HT2B receptor), and HTR2C (serotonin 5-HT2C receptor).
Step 4: Given the presence of multiple functional groups, the molecule may also interact with kinases and other proteins involved in signal transduction pathways. For instance, it could bind to kinases like CDK2 (cyclin-dependent kinase 2) or LCK (lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase).
Step 5: Considering the overall complexity and functional groups present in the molecule, it is most likely to have relationships with genes involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmission, and signaling pathways. The related gene names include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KDR, MCL1, OPRK1, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, and possibly others depending on the exact mechanism of action of the molecule.
