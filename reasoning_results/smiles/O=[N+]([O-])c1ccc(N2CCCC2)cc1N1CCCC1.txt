Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=[N+]([O-])c1ccc(N2CCCC2)cc1N1CCCC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule has a complex structure that includes a nitroso group (O=[N+]), an aromatic ring system, and several heteroatoms such as oxygen and nitrogen. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes or receptors that contain similar functional groups or are involved in metabolism.
Step 2: Analyzing the gene list, we find several genes related to drug metabolism and receptor function. For instance, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 are known for their role in metabolizing various drugs, including those with similar chemical structures to the given molecule. These genes encode enzymes that could interact directly with the molecule.
Step 3: Additionally, genes like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4 encode dopamine receptors, which are known to bind small molecules with similar functional groups. The presence of a nitroso group and heteroatoms in the molecule could potentially make it a ligand for these receptors.
Step 4: The molecule's structure also suggests possible interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), as seen in genes such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which encode serotonin receptors. The aromatic rings and heteroatoms could be key in binding to these receptors.
Step 5: Given the structure of the molecule and its potential to interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C), the related genes include:
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- DRD2
- DRD3
- DRD4
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
These genes play critical roles in the metabolism and signaling pathways that could be affected by the molecule's structure.
