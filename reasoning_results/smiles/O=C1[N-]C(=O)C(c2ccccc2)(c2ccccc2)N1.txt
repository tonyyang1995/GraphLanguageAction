Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C1[N-]C(=O)C(c2ccccc2)(c2ccccc2)N1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a structure that includes an amide group (-CONH), a cyano group (-CN), and aromatic rings (c2ccccc2). This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of the cyano group and aromatic rings could indicate a molecule designed to inhibit or interact with enzymes such as CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are known for their role in metabolizing various drugs.
Step 3: CYP2D6 is associated with genes like CYP2D6 itself, and CYP3A4 is linked to CYP3A4 gene. These enzymes play crucial roles in the metabolism of many drugs, including those that might interact with neurotransmitter receptors.
Step 4: Given the interaction potential with CYP enzymes, the molecule might also affect genes related to neurotransmitter systems. For instance, it could potentially influence DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), HTR2A (Serotonin receptor 2A), and HTR2B (Serotonin receptor 2B), which are all involved in regulating neurotransmission.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and the potential for interaction with metabolic enzymes and neurotransmitter systems, the molecule could be related to the following genes: CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, and HTR2B.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- DRD2
- HTR2A
- HTR2B Step 1: The molecule contains an amide group (-CONH), a cyano group (-CN), and aromatic rings (c2ccccc2). These features suggest potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The cyano group and aromatic rings indicate a molecule designed to inhibit or interact with enzymes such as CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are known for metabolizing various drugs.
Step 3: CYP2D6 is associated with the CYP2D6 gene, and CYP3A4 is linked to the CYP3A4 gene. These enzymes play significant roles in drug metabolism.
Step 4: The interaction potential with CYP enzymes suggests the molecule might also affect genes related to neurotransmitter systems, such as DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), HTR2A (Serotonin receptor 2A), and HTR2B (Serotonin receptor 2B).
Step 5: Based on the structural features and potential interactions, the molecule is likely related to the following genes: CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, and HTR2B.
- HTR2B
Note: The remaining genes listed in the prompt do not have a direct structural or functional connection to the molecule based on the provided SMILES string. They may be relevant in other contexts but are not directly related to this molecule's structure. Step 1: The molecule contains an amide group (-CONH), a cyano group (-CN), and aromatic rings (c2ccccc2). These features suggest potential interactions with enzymes
