Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc2[n-]c(-c3ccc(NC(=O)Cc4cccs4)cc3)nc2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings and heteroatoms, including nitrogen and sulfur. Notably, it contains a nitrile group (-CN) and a carboxamide group (-CONH2). This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes that metabolize drugs or xenobiotics.
Step 2: The presence of the carboxamide group (-CONH2) could indicate the molecule might be an inhibitor or substrate for enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP (Cytochrome P450) enzymes. Specifically, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 are known to metabolize molecules containing amide groups.
Step 3: The nitrile group (-CN) in the molecule might also suggest it could interact with enzymes involved in nitrile metabolism. While there are no direct genes listed for this function, CYP4 families are sometimes involved in the metabolism of nitriles.
Step 4: Given the presence of a carboxamide group and a nitrile group, the molecule may have affinity for receptors that bind small molecules with similar functional groups. Genes like DRD2, HTR2A, and HTR2B encode dopamine and serotonin receptors, respectively, which could interact with the molecule due to their binding sites.
Step 5: The molecule's structure does not directly suggest interactions with other genes listed, such as ABCB1, FLT1, or PTGS1, which are associated with transport, angiogenesis, and inflammation, respectively. 
Summary of Related Gene Names:
- CYP2D6
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
