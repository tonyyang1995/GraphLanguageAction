Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cccc(N2CC[NH+](C(=O)c3cc(S(=O)(=O)[NH+](C)C)ccc3N3CCCC3)CC2)c1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with multiple functional groups and rings. The molecule contains a nitrogen atom that is part of a cyclic amine group, which suggests potential interactions with proteins containing binding sites for amine-containing molecules.
Step 2: The presence of a sulfur atom linked to an oxygen atom (S(=O)(=O)) indicates the presence of a sulfone group, which could interact with proteins containing sulfone-binding sites or influence protein conformation through hydrogen bonding or hydrophobic interactions.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a quinolone-like structure, which might interact with enzymes or receptors that have specific binding pockets for this type of chemical moiety.
Step 4: Considering the molecular structure, it is likely that the molecule could interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to its size and the presence of amine and aromatic groups, which are common in GPCR ligands. This interaction could be relevant to several of the listed genes, such as DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode for different subtypes of serotonin receptors.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule may have some affinity for enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, given the presence of functional groups that could be metabolized by these enzymes.
Summary of related gene names: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
