Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+]1CC[NH+]2c3ncccc3Cc3ccccc3C2C1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure containing multiple functional groups such as amine (NH+) and aromatic rings. The presence of these functional groups suggests that the molecule could be involved in interactions with receptors or enzymes that have similar chemical properties.
Step 2: Looking at the gene list provided, several genes encode for receptors or enzymes that might interact with molecules containing amine groups and aromatic rings. For example, DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2) and HTR2A (Serotonin receptor 2A) both have amine binding sites, which could potentially interact with the amine group of the molecule.
Step 3: Additionally, CYP2D6 (Cytochrome P450 2D6) and CYP2C19 (Cytochrome P450 2C19) are enzymes that metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics, including those with aromatic rings. The molecule’s aromatic structure may make it a substrate for these enzymes, leading to potential pharmacokinetic interactions.
Step 4: The presence of multiple nitrogen-containing functional groups (amines) in the molecule suggests it could also interact with other receptors like CHRM1 (Cholinergic receptor muscarinic M1), which binds acetylcholine, a compound with an amine group.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names: DRD2, HTR2A, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CHRM1.
The related gene names are DRD2, HTR2A, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CHRM1. These genes encode proteins that may interact with the molecule due to their specific binding sites or metabolic functions.
