Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(OCC(=O)[NH+]2CCN(c3ccc([N+](=O)[O-])c(N4CCOCC4)c3)CC2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure containing several functional groups such as an amide (N=C=O), an ester (O-C-O), a ketone (C=O), a carboxylic acid (O-COOH), and a cyclic amine (N+). These functional groups are characteristic of small molecules that can interact with receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The cyclic amine group, specifically the positively charged N+ center, suggests that this molecule could be a ligand for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are known to bind to and activate through their intracellular domains. This is supported by the presence of multiple cholinergic and adrenergic receptor genes in the provided list, indicating potential interactions with these receptors.
Step 3: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (O-COOH) and an ester group (O-C-O) indicates that this molecule could also interact with enzymes such as cytochrome P450s (CYP), which metabolize various compounds including drugs and xenobiotics. The CYP family of genes listed (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) are directly relevant to this interaction.
Step 4: The cyclic amine and amide functionalities suggest potential binding to ion channels and transporters. For example, the gene KCNH2 codes for a potassium channel, and SLC6A2 and SLC6A4 code for neurotransmitter transporters, all of which might interact with this molecule due to its functional groups.
Step 5: Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, it is likely that this molecule interacts with multiple genes from different categories. However, based on the structural analysis, the most probable genes include those involved in neurotransmission (e.g., HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), GPCR signaling pathways (e.g., CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), and drug metabolism (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Summary of Related Gene Names:
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4
- CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2
- CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4
- KCNH2, SLC6A2, SLC6A4
These genes are involved in neurotransmission, GPCR signaling, and drug metabolism, which align with the structural characteristics of the molecule.
