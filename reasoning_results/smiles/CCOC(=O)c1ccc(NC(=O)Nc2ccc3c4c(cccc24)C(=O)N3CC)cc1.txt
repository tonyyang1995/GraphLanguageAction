Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)c1ccc(NC(=O)Nc2ccc3c4c(cccc24)C(=O)N3CC)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule has a complex structure with several functional groups such as amide (N-C=O), aromatic rings, and a cyclic amine group. These structural elements suggest the molecule could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways or enzymatic activities.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of an amide group and a cyclic amine could indicate the molecule might be an agonist or antagonist for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are encoded by genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These receptors are known to have amide or cyclic amine ligands.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is common in many drugs that inhibit enzymes like cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, specifically CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These enzymes are crucial in drug metabolism and can affect the efficacy and toxicity of many medications.
Step 4: Furthermore, the cyclic amine group in the molecule may also suggest potential interactions with ion channels, such as KCNH2, which encodes the hERG potassium channel. This type of interaction is important for understanding the pharmacological effects of the molecule on cardiac function.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and KCNH2. These genes encode receptors and enzymes that are likely to interact directly or indirectly with the described molecule due to its structural characteristics.
