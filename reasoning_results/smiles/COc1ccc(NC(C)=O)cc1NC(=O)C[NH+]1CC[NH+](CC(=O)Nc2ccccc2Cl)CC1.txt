Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(NC(C)=O)cc1NC(=O)C[NH+]1CC[NH+](CC(=O)Nc2ccccc2Cl)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring system and an amide group, which are common in many ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This suggests potential interactions with receptors that have these functional groups in their binding sites.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) and an ester group (C(=O)O-) indicates the molecule could interact with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a benzene ring with a chloride substituent, which may suggest potential interactions with ion channels or transporters. This could be relevant to genes like KCNH2, which encodes a potassium channel, or SLC6A4, which encodes a neurotransmitter transporter.
Step 4: The overall structure hints at possible interactions with receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmission or signal transduction pathways, which might relate to genes such as DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR6, which encode dopamine and serotonin receptors.
Step 5: Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, the molecule might interact with multiple targets, including enzymes and receptors, potentially affecting several signaling pathways. This broad interaction profile could involve genes such as EGFR, PTGS1, and CYP1A2, which are involved in various cellular processes.
