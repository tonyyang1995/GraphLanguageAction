Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)[NH+]2Cc3ccccc3CC2C(=O)N=c2[n-]ccs2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure containing a benzene ring system, an oxazolone moiety, and a sulfonamide group attached to a nitrogen atom. The presence of a sulfonamide and a nitrogen atom suggests the molecule may have potential as an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes that metabolize drugs or neurotransmitters.
Step 2: Among the given genes, several are involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmitter signaling. For example, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are cytochrome P450 enzymes that play key roles in the metabolism of various drugs, including those that might interact with this molecule.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a quinoline-like structure, which could potentially interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Genes like DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C are all associated with serotonin receptors, while DRD3 and DRD4 are dopamine receptors. These receptors are known to be targets for various psychoactive substances.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a nitrophenyl group in the molecule might allow it to interact with ion channels or transporters. Genes such as KCNH2 (encoding the hERG potassium channel) and SLC6A4 (encoding the serotonin transporter) are relevant here.
Step 5: Based on the structure and functional groups present in the molecule, the most likely related genes are those involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6), neurotransmitter signaling (DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD3, DRD4), and ion channel/transporter activity (KCNH2, SLC6A4).
