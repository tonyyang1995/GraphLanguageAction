Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N=c1[n-]c(=O)[n-]cc1F, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a quinoline-like structure, which is characterized by a benzene ring fused to an imidazole ring. This structural feature suggests that it may interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a fluorine atom (-F) attached to the nitrogen atom in the molecule indicates potential interactions with receptors or transporters that have a preference for fluorinated ligands. This could be relevant to genes involved in neurotransmitter systems, such as adrenergic and cholinergic receptors.
Step 3: The molecule contains a nitrile group (-CN), which can form hydrogen bonds and may contribute to its binding affinity for proteins with hydrogen bond acceptor sites. This could be relevant to genes encoding ion channels or receptors that have hydrogen bonding capabilities.
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule, including the nitrile group and the amide group, suggests potential interactions with enzymes or receptors that are involved in signal transduction pathways. This could be relevant to genes like CYP2D6, which encodes a CYP enzyme involved in the metabolism of many drugs.
Step 5: Based on the above structural features, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmission, and signal transduction pathways. Specifically, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
