Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])c1ccc[n-]c1=Nc1cccc(C(F)(F)F)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring fused to an imidazole ring, which is characteristic of compounds that can interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature may suggest potential interactions with genes encoding for GPCRs.
Step 2: The molecule also has a quinoline moiety, which is known to be involved in interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs). This indicates possible metabolic pathways involving CYP enzymes encoded by genes such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
Step 3: The presence of fluorine atoms in the molecule suggests potential interaction with voltage-gated calcium channels, which are encoded by genes like CACNA1H. These channels are involved in neurotransmitter release and ion channel function.
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule includes elements that could modulate neurotransmission, given its complexity and functional groups. This may indicate interactions with genes involved in neurotransmitter signaling, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 5: Given the diverse structural features and potential interactions with multiple biological processes, the molecule may have relationships with several genes including GPCRs, CYP enzymes, calcium channels, and neurotransmitter receptors. 
Summary of related gene names: ADRB2, CACNA1H, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
