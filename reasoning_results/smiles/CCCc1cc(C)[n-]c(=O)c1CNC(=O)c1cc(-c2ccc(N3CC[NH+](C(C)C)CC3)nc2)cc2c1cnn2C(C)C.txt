Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCc1cc(C)[n-]c(=O)c1CNC(=O)c1cc(-c2ccc(N3CC[NH+](C(C)C)CC3)nc2)cc2c1cnn2C(C)C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a complex structure including a benzene ring, a pyrrolidine ring, and various substituents such as alkyl chains, a carboxamide group, and a nitrile group. This structure suggests the molecule could be a small molecule drug or a ligand for receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH2) indicates the molecule might act as an antagonist or agonist for receptors that bind to this functional group. Receptors like adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) often have binding sites for carboxamide-containing ligands.
Step 3: The nitrile group (-CN) is typically found in ligands that interact with enzymes or receptors. It can form hydrogen bonds or participate in other intermolecular interactions. CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) are known to metabolize compounds containing nitrile groups.
Step 4: Given the complexity and the presence of functional groups that can interact with various proteins, the molecule likely interacts with multiple targets. However, based on the provided genes, the most relevant ones would be those involved in signal transduction pathways, receptor binding, and metabolism.
Step 5: Therefore, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. These genes encode proteins that could potentially interact directly with the molecule or be affected by its metabolic products.
