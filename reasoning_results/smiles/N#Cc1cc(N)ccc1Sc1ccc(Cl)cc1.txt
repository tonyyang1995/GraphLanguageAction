Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N#Cc1cc(N)ccc1Sc1ccc(Cl)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom double-bonded to a carbon (N#C), indicating it likely interacts with proteins involved in signaling pathways, such as receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a phenolic group (-OH) and a carboxyl group (-COOH) suggests potential interactions with enzymes or transporters that metabolize or transport molecules containing these functional groups.
Step 3: The molecule includes a substituted benzene ring, which may interact with proteins that bind aromatic compounds, such as certain receptors or transporters.
Step 4: Given the presence of a sulfur atom and chlorine atoms, the molecule could potentially interact with proteins involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling or transport processes.
Step 5: Based on the structural features, the molecule may be related to genes encoding for GPCRs, enzymes, and transporters such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KDR, LCK, and SLC6A4.
