Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: FC(F)(F)c1ccc(CN=c2ccc(Cc3c[nH]c4ncc(Cl)cc34)c[n-]2)cn1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this is relevant.
Step 1: The molecule contains multiple fluorine atoms (F) and nitro groups (-NO2), which are typically involved in interactions with proteins such as enzymes and receptors. These functional groups may bind to specific sites on certain genes' encoded proteins.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) and a nitrogen atom in the molecule suggests potential interaction with proteins that contain nitrogenous bases or amino acids, which could be relevant to genes encoding neurotransmitter receptors or transporters.
Step 3: The cyclic structure with a nitrogen atom and a phenyl ring indicates possible binding to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly those containing aromatic residues and basic patches, such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 4: The molecule also includes a benzene ring with a cyano group, which might interact with enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). These enzymes are involved in drug metabolism and could potentially be influenced by the molecule's chemical structure.
Step 5: Given the diverse functional groups and the presence of aromatic rings, the molecule could interact with several genes involved in neurotransmission and receptor signaling, including DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
