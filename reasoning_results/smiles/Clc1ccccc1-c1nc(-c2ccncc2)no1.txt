Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Clc1ccccc1-c1nc(-c2ccncc2)no1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure containing aromatic rings (cyclohexene), a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (imidazole), and a chloride ion. This structure suggests it could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors that interact with such functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the heterocyclic ring (-c2ccncc2) indicates potential for interaction with proteins containing amine-binding sites, such as receptors or transporters. This is relevant to genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and transporters.
Step 3: The imidazole ring and overall hydrophobic nature of the molecule suggest it might have affinity for enzymes involved in phase I metabolism (e.g., cytochrome P450s) or GPCRs. This aligns with several genes listed, including CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and DRD2 (a GPCR).
Step 4: Given the aromatic rings and nitrogen-containing heterocycles, this molecule could potentially bind to ion channels or receptors that are sensitive to such structures. This is relevant to genes like KCNH2 (a potassium channel) and HTR2A (a serotonin receptor).
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and functional groups, the molecule might influence signaling pathways involving GPCRs and enzymes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism. Genes directly involved include those encoding GPCRs (e.g., HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C) and enzymes (e.g., CYP2C9, CYP3A4).
