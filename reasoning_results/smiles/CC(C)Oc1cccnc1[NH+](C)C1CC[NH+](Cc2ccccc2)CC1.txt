Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)Oc1cccnc1[NH+](C)C1CC[NH+](Cc2ccccc2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is common in many drugs that interact with receptors and transporters. This structure is often involved in interactions with genes encoding for drug targets such as receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule, specifically in the form of [NH+] (ammonium), suggests potential interactions with genes encoding for receptors that have positively charged binding sites, such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 3: The aromatic amine group in the molecule might also indicate a possible interaction with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are known to metabolize many drugs including those with aromatic amines.
Step 4: The overall structure includes multiple functional groups like amide and ester, which could potentially interact with genes encoding for G-protein coupled receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1) and ion channels (KCNH2), given their diverse ligand-binding capacities.
Step 5: Considering the detailed chemical structure and its potential interactions with various biological targets, the most likely related genes from the provided list include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, KCNH2. 
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, KCNH2.
