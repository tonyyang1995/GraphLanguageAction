Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Cn1c(SCc2ccccc2)nc2ccccc21)[NH+]1CCOCC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring, which is a cyclic amine structure that can interact with receptors such as adrenergic and cholinergic receptors. This structure is relevant to genes encoding for these receptors.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a benzene ring with a cyano group (-CN), which could potentially interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP (cytochrome P450) genes.
Step 3: The presence of an imidazole ring and a quinoline-like structure suggests potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly those involved in neurotransmission and hormone signaling, such as HTR (serotonin receptor) and HRH1 (histamine receptor).
Step 4: The molecule has a carboxamide group, which can form hydrogen bonds and may interact with enzymes or receptors involved in signal transduction pathways, such as those encoded by PTGS1 (COX-1) and SLC6A4 (norepinephrine transporter).
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and functional groups, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, PTGS1, SLC6A4.
