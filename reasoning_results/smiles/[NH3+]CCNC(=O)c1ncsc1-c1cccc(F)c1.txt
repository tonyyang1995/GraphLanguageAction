Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [NH3+]CCNC(=O)c1ncsc1-c1cccc(F)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that contains an amine group (-NH3+), a benzene ring (CC), a pyrrolidine ring (Nc1ncsc1), and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The presence of an amine and a carboxylic acid suggests that this molecule could be an amide or a derivative thereof.
Step 2: The molecular structure includes a fluorine atom (F) attached to the benzene ring, which indicates that the molecule might have some specific pharmacological properties due to its substituent.
Step 3: Considering the pattern of the molecule and its functional groups, it is likely to interact with proteins that have binding sites for amides or similar molecules. One such protein is the CYP2D6 enzyme, which metabolizes many drugs through oxidative reactions involving amides.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure might also interact with receptors that bind to amides, such as the dopamine receptor DRD2, which is involved in various neurological processes.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the related genes are CYP2D6 and DRD2.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2D6
- DRD2 Step 1: The given molecule has an amine group (-NH3+) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), suggesting it could be an amide or a derivative thereof.
Step 2: The molecule also contains a benzene ring (CC) and a pyrrolidine ring (Nc1ncsc1), which are common in drug molecules.
Step 3: The presence of a fluorine atom (F) on the benzene ring could indicate specific interactions with proteins or receptors that recognize halogenated compounds.
Step 4: Given the amide structure, the molecule might interact with enzymes like CYP2D6, which metabolizes amides, and receptors like DRD2, which binds amides.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure, the related genes are CYP2D6 and DRD2.
- DRD2
Note: While the molecule's structure suggests interactions with these two genes, other genes listed may not have a direct relationship based on the provided information. Further detailed analysis would be required to confirm any additional gene relationships.
