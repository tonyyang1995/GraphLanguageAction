Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC[NH+]1CC[NH+](C(=O)C2c3cc(OC)c(OC)cc3C(=O)[NH+]3CCc4ccccc4C23)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains multiple aromatic rings and amine groups, which are common in ligands that interact with receptors. This suggests potential interaction with receptor proteins.
Step 2: The presence of a pyrrolidine ring (indicated by the nitrogen with an acetyl group and methyl substituents) and a benzene ring with carboxylic acid substituutes indicates a structure similar to known ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors.
Step 3: The molecule's structure also includes a benzene ring with a carbonyl group and an amide linkage, which could indicate it may be an inhibitor or activator of enzymes like CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: Given the presence of amine groups and carboxylic acids, the molecule might interact with ion channels or transporters, potentially affecting genes like KCNH2 (a potassium channel) or SLC6A4 (a serotonin transporter).
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is most likely related to genes encoding GPCRs, enzymes involved in drug metabolism, and ion channels/transporters. Therefore, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, and SLC6A4.
