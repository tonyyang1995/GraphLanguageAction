Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C1C2CC[NH+](CC2)C1(CO)CO, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is an organic compound with a complex structure, including a benzene ring, amide group, and multiple alkyl chains. The presence of a benzene ring and an amide group suggests it could be an aromatic amide, which often interacts with proteins involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways.
Step 2: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (N+), indicating it may act as a cationic compound. Cationic molecules can interact with various ion channels and receptors, particularly those that are sensitive to charged species.
Step 3: Given the presence of an amine group (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), the molecule likely has amphipathic properties. This amphipathicity can allow the molecule to interact with cell membranes and potentially affect membrane-bound receptors and ion channels.
Step 4: Considering the structure and potential interactions, the molecule might have affinity for receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4). These receptors are known to interact with various ligands and modulators, and the molecule's structure could fit into their binding sites.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule's ability to interact with ion channels (e.g., KCNH2) and enzymes (e.g., CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) due to its complex structure and functional groups makes it relevant to these genes. These enzymes are involved in drug metabolism and could be affected by the molecule's presence.
