Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cccc(Nc2ccccc2C(=O)[O-])c1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with a benzene ring containing a nitrogen atom and an amide group (Nc2ccccc2C(=O)). This suggests that the molecule could be a ligand or inhibitor for proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the ring structure and the amide group indicates that this molecule may interact with receptors or enzymes that have binding sites for small molecules containing these functional groups. For example, it could potentially bind to GPCRs like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, or HTR1A, which all have similar binding sites.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of an amide group and a benzene ring also suggests that this molecule might inhibit enzymes like CYP2C19, CYP2C9, or CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 4: The overall structure does not suggest direct interaction with enzymes or receptors listed for genes such as ABCB1, ABL1, CDK2, CACNA1H, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, ESR1, FLT1, HRH1, KDR, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, PPARG, PTGS1, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2, or SLC6A4, based on their typical protein structures.
Step 5: Therefore, the related genes to the molecule are ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6.
