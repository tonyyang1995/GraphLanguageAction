Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(CNC(=O)c2cc(-c3cncc(Cl)c3)cnc2-c2ccccn2)nc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule, likely an inhibitor or modulator of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This is indicated by the presence of a benzene ring system and a nitrogen atom that could form part of a binding pocket for a receptor.
Step 2: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring and a quinoline moiety, which are common features in ligands for various GPCRs. Specifically, the quinoline group could interact with the orthosteric binding site of certain GPCRs, suggesting potential interaction with receptors that have this pharmacophore.
Step 3: Given the structure, the molecule might be designed to target GPCRs involved in neurotransmission or hormonal signaling pathways, which aligns with several of the listed genes known to encode such receptors. For example, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4 are all GPCRs that could potentially bind to this type of ligand.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH-) suggests the molecule may act as a reversible inhibitor or agonist, which is characteristic of some drugs targeting GPCRs like those encoded by HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are serotonin receptors.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is most likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C. These genes encode G-protein coupled receptors that are known to interact with small molecules similar to the described structure.
