Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples.
Step 1: The molecule [NH3+]CCSSCC[NH3+] is an amine-containing compound with two positively charged nitrogen atoms, suggesting it could interact with ion channels or receptors that have binding sites for basic amino groups. The presence of multiple sulfur atoms (S) indicates potential thioether or sulfide functionalities which can form covalent bonds or hydrogen bonds.
Step 2: The sulfur-containing functionalities in the molecule may be relevant to genes involved in signal transduction pathways, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which often contain cysteine residues that can participate in disulfide bridges or form hydrogen bonds. This suggests potential interactions with genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and HRH1, which encode various types of GPCRs.
Step 3: The positively charged nitrogen atoms in the molecule may interact with acidic residues in proteins, such as glutamic acid or aspartic acid, which are common in ion channel proteins. This interaction could be relevant to genes encoding ion channels, such as CACNA1H and KCNH2, which encode voltage-gated calcium and potassium channels, respectively.
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule does not strongly suggest direct interactions with enzymes or metabolic pathways. However, some of the genes listed, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which encode cytochrome P450 enzymes, might indirectly be influenced by the molecule if it were to affect the expression or function of these enzymes through its interactions with other proteins.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule [NH3+]CCSSCC[NH3+] is most likely to be related to genes encoding GPCRs and ion channels due to the presence of basic amino groups and sulfur-containing functionalities. The related gene names include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and HRH1, as well as CACNA1H and KCNH2. Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, CACNA1H, KCNH2.
