Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NC(=[NH2+])SCCc1cccc(CCSC(N)=[NH2+])c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule has a complex structure featuring multiple amine groups, sulfur atoms, and aromatic rings. The presence of these functional groups suggests potential interactions with proteins that have similar chemical properties, such as receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: Analyzing the genes listed, many are associated with neurotransmitter receptors (e.g., DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A), ion channels (e.g., KCNH2), and metabolic enzymes (e.g., CYP2C19, CYP2D6). Given the molecule’s structure, it is likely to interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 3: The molecule contains a quinoline-like structure, which is often found in ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs like those encoded by genes such as DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2) and HTR2A (serotonin receptor 5-HT2A) could potentially bind this molecule.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of amine groups and aromatic rings suggests possible interaction with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs), such as CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, which metabolize many drugs and endogenous substances.
Step 5: Based on the molecule’s structure and potential interactions, the related genes include: DRD2, HTR2A, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and possibly other GPCRs and metabolic enzymes.
Summary of Related Genes:
- DRD2
- HTR2A
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- Other GPCRs and metabolic enzymes (based on structural similarity)
