Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccccc1OCC[NH2+]CC(O)COc1cccc2[nH]c3ccccc3c12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains multiple aromatic rings, specifically benzene rings, which are common in many drug molecules due to their stability and ability to form hydrogen bonds. This structural feature suggests that the molecule could interact with proteins that have binding sites for aromatic compounds, such as receptors or transporters.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-CONH2) indicates that this molecule might be involved in interactions with proteins containing amine groups, such as certain receptors or enzymes. This is particularly relevant for genes encoding receptors like CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which all contain amine groups in their structures.
Step 3: The molecule also has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which could potentially interact with proteins that have ion channels or transporters, such as CACNA1H and KCNH2. These genes encode calcium channels and potassium channels, respectively, both of which can interact with acidic molecules.
Step 4: Given the complexity and diverse functional groups present in the molecule, it is likely to interact with a variety of proteins rather than being specifically related to just one or two genes. However, based on the identified structural features, it could have potential interactions with genes encoding receptors (like CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) and ion channels (like CACNA1H, KCNH2).
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the molecule may be related to the following genes: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CACNA1H, KCNH2. These genes are involved in neurotransmission and ion channel function, which aligns with the structural features observed in the molecule. 
Related Gene Names:
- CHRM1
- CHRM3
- CHRM4
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- HTR6
- CACNA1H

These genes are involved in neurotransmission and ion channel function, aligning with the structural features of the molecule. Further experimental validation would be needed to confirm these potential interactions.
