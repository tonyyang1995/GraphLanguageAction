Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc(-c2nn(CC[NH+]3CCC([NH+](C)C)CC3)c3[n-]cnc(=N)c23)ccc1NC(=O)OC(C)(C)C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a complex structure including a pyrrole ring system, a benzene ring, and several functional groups such as amine, carbonyl, and ester. These structural features suggest potential interactions with receptors that have similar chemical properties, particularly those involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of an amine group (-NH+) and a carbonyl group (-CO-) could indicate a potential interaction with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which often bind to molecules containing these functional groups. Specifically, this might relate to adrenergic and cholinergic receptors, given the presence of multiple amines and the overall size and shape of the molecule.
Step 3: The molecule's size and shape, along with its functional groups, suggest it could interact with receptors involved in the regulation of neurotransmitters. For example, it may interact with dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 4: The presence of a benzene ring and a carbonyl group also indicates possible interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). These enzymes are crucial for the metabolism of many drugs and endogenous substances.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and functional groups, it is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. 
Summary: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
