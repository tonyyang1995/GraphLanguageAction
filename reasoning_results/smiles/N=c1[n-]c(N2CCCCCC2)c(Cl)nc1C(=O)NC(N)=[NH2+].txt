Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N=c1[n-]c(N2CCCCCC2)c(Cl)nc1C(=O)NC(N)=[NH2+], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with a central nitrogen atom that forms a triple bond (N=c1), indicating the presence of a potentially reactive electrophilic site. This feature is significant because it could interact with enzymes or receptors that have specific binding sites for such functional groups.
Step 2: The molecule also contains a nitrogen atom with a negative charge (-[n-]), which suggests it might be involved in hydrogen bonding or other types of electrostatic interactions. This could be relevant to proteins that have positively charged residues or binding pockets.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule includes a cyclic structure (c1) connected to a benzene ring (C(=O)NC(N)=), which may indicate potential binding to aromatic amino acids or other aromatic residues in proteins. Such structures are often found in ligands that interact with receptors or enzymes.
Step 4: The presence of multiple functional groups (e.g., amine, carboxyl, and halogen) could suggest that the molecule might interact with various proteins, including those involved in signal transduction pathways, ion channels, or metabolic enzymes. These functional groups could bind to different sites on the proteins, affecting their activity.
Step 5: Given the complexity and the presence of specific functional groups, the molecule could be related to several genes involved in neurotransmission, receptor function, and metabolic pathways. Specifically, the molecule may interact with genes encoding receptors like adrenergic (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), dopaminergic (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), and serotonergic (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) receptors, as well as genes involved in the metabolism of neurotransmitters (CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
