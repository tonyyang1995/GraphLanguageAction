Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C=CC(=O)Nc1cc2c(=Nc3ccc(F)c(Cl)c3)[n-]cnc2cc1OCCC[NH+]1CCOCC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring system (C=CC(=O)N), which is characteristic of many drugs that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structure suggests potential interactions with genes encoding GPCRs.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-CONH-) and a hydroxyl group (-OH) indicates the molecule could be an agonist or antagonist for receptors such as muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (MChRs), which are encoded by genes like CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 3: The molecule also has a benzene ring system and a phenolic group (-OC(=O)CH3), which might suggest interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 4: The presence of a quinolone-like structure (OCCC[NH+]) points towards possible interactions with enzymes like HTR2A, which encodes the serotonin receptor 2A.
Step 5: Given the multiple functional groups and the overall structure, the molecule is likely to interact with several genes including CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and HTR2A.
