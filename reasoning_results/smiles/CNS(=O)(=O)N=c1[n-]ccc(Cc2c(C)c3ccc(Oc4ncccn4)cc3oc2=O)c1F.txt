Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CNS(=O)(=O)N=c1[n-]ccc(Cc2c(C)c3ccc(Oc4ncccn4)cc3oc2=O)c1F, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this might be important.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with a nitro group (-NO2) attached, which is part of the CNS (Cyanuric Sulfamate) fragment. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes that metabolize nitrogen-containing compounds, such as CYP2E1, but this enzyme is not listed in the provided gene list.
Step 2: The molecule also has a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to a benzene ring, which could indicate potential interactions with enzymes involved in the metabolism of phenolic compounds, like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Both CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 are present in the provided gene list.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule contains a quinone moiety (quinone structure), which might interact with enzymes involved in redox reactions, such as NQO1 (NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1). However, NQO1 is not included in the provided gene list.
Step 4: The presence of a fluorine atom (-F) on the molecule indicates it may have steric and electronic effects that could influence interactions with receptors or transporters, particularly those involved in G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathways. Genes like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4 (dopamine receptors) and HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C (serotonin receptors) are relevant here. All these genes are present in the provided list.
Step 5: The molecule's complex structure, including the nitro group, phenolic hydroxyl group, and quinone moiety, suggests potential interactions with multiple drug targets. Among the listed genes, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C are directly related due to their involvement in metabolism and neurotransmission.
Summary of Related Genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with a nitro group (-NO2) attached, which is part of the CNS (Cyanuric Sulfamate) fragment. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes that metabolize nitrogen-containing compounds, such as CYP2E1, but this enzyme is not listed in the provided gene list.
Step 3: The molecule contains a quinone moiety, which might interact with enzymes involved in redox reactions, such as NQO1 (NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1
