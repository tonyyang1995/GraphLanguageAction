Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(=O)c1ccc(NC(=O)CSc2nnc(-c3ccco3)c(-c3ccco3)n2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that contains a benzene ring system with a carboxamide group attached to it, along with several nitrogen-containing heterocycles and a naphthylamine moiety. This structural pattern suggests the molecule could be a potential ligand for receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmission, signal transduction, or drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group (N-C(=O)-) and the overall structure of the molecule indicate it might interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are often involved in signal transduction pathways. This structural feature aligns with the presence of several GPCR-related genes in the provided list, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a naphthylamine moiety, which is known to have potential interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs). This is relevant to the CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 genes, which encode enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: Additionally, the complex aromatic structure and the presence of multiple functional groups suggest the molecule could potentially modulate ion channels, which is relevant to KCNH2, a gene encoding the hERG potassium channel.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and KCNH2. These genes are associated with neurotransmission, signal transduction, and drug metabolism pathways. 
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, KCNH2.
