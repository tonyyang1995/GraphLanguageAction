Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COC(=O)c1cc(-c2ccc(C)o2)nc2ccccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a structure that includes a benzene ring with an acetyl group (CO) attached to it, which is part of a larger complex structure involving multiple rings and functional groups. This type of structure is often found in molecules that interact with receptors or enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of an acetyl group and the overall complex structure suggest that this molecule could potentially act as a ligand for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are known to be involved in many physiological processes and are targeted by various drugs.
Step 3: Given the molecular structure, the molecule might interact with receptors such as adrenergic receptors (e.g., ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and serotonin receptors (e.g., HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6). These receptors are known to have diverse ligands and are involved in various neurotransmission processes.
Step 4: The molecule's structure also suggests potential interactions with enzymes like cytochrome P450s (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are important in drug metabolism and could affect the pharmacokinetics of the molecule.
Step 5: Based on the above structural analysis, the related genes to this molecule are likely to be those encoding receptors and enzymes involved in signal transduction and drug metabolism. The related gene names include:
- Adrenergic receptors: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2
- Serotonin receptors: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- Cytochrome P450 enzymes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4
These genes encode proteins that could directly interact with or be influenced by the described molecular structure.
