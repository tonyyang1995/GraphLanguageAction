Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: OCc1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The SMILES string "OCc1ccccc1" represents a molecule with a benzene ring system and an oxygen atom attached to it. This structure is characteristic of a class of molecules known as phenols or aromatic compounds.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring suggests that this molecule could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, such as receptors and kinases, which are encoded by some of the listed genes.
Step 3: Notably, the molecule's aromatic nature might allow for binding to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like those encoded by ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, as these receptors typically have binding sites for ligands with similar aromatic structures.
Step 4: Furthermore, the oxygen functionality might enable the molecule to act as a substrate for enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are involved in phase I drug metabolism.
Step 5: Based on the structural characteristics of the molecule, the genes that are most likely to be directly or indirectly related to its function include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These genes encode proteins that could potentially interact with or metabolize the described molecule.
