Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC[NH+](CC)S(=O)(=O)c1ccc(C(=O)N=c2ncn(Cc3ccccc3)[n-]2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (NH+), indicating it may act as an ion channel modulator or interact with receptors that have positively charged sites.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a sulfonate group (S(=O)(=O)), which can form hydrogen bonds and interact with proteins containing acidic residues.
Step 3: The presence of a benzene ring (CC) and a carbonyl group (C(=O)) suggests potential interactions with enzymes or receptors that have hydrophobic binding pockets or active sites.
Step 4: The cyclic structure with nitrogen and carbon atoms (c1ccc(C(=O)N=c2ncn(Cc3ccccc3)[n-]2)cc1) indicates possible interaction with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or ion channels.
Step 5: Based on the structural features, the molecule may be related to genes involved in neurotransmission and receptor signaling, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
Related genes: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
