Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc(N)c(Cl)cc1C(=O)NC1CC[NH+](Cc2ccccc2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a benzene ring with a nitrogen atom (N), which is substituted by a chlorine atom (Cl). This pattern suggests potential interactions with proteins that have similar functional groups or binding sites, such as receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an amide group (-CONH-), which are common in many ligands and substrates for enzymes and receptors. These functional groups can form hydrogen bonds and other interactions with amino acid residues in proteins.
Step 3: The presence of a quinoline-like structure (quinoline is a heterocyclic aromatic compound) and a pyridine ring in the molecule might indicate potential interactions with proteins that contain these motifs or have similar structures.
Step 4: Considering the molecular structure and functional groups, the molecule could potentially interact with receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmission, drug metabolism, and cell signaling pathways. For example, it may interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or enzymes involved in the biosynthesis or metabolism of neurotransmitters.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule is most likely related to genes encoding GPCRs, enzymes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism, and genes associated with cell signaling pathways. The related gene names include:
- ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4
- PTGS1
- SIGMAR1
- SLC6A2, SLC6A4
Note: This is a simplified summary based on the provided information and does not represent a comprehensive analysis of all possible interactions. The actual relationships may be more complex and require further investigation. The gene list focuses on those most likely to interact directly with the molecule's structural features. Step 5: Summary of Related Gene Names:
- ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2 (Adrenergic receptors)
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6 (Serotonin receptors)
- CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 (Cytochrome P450 enzymes)
- PTGS1 (Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1)
- SIGMAR1 (Sigma-1 receptor)
- SLC6A2, SLC6A4 (Solute carrier family 6 members)
