Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(O)=NO, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples or extra context.
Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string CC(O)=NO has a pyrrole ring system with an amide group attached to the nitrogen atom. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins that have similar functional groups or binding sites.
Step 2: The amide group (CON) can form hydrogen bonds and can interact with charged amino acid residues such as glutamate or aspartate, which are common in receptor proteins like G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels.
Step 3: Several of the listed genes encode for GPCRs, including HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are known to bind to various ligands, including amides. The molecule could potentially interact with these receptors through its amide group.
Step 4: The molecule also has a ketone group (C=O), which can participate in hydrogen bonding and can interact with enzymes or proteins containing amino acid residues that can form hydrogen bonds with carbonyl groups, such as those found in CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure, the molecule may be related to the following genes: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. These genes are involved in neurotransmitter signaling and metabolism, suggesting the molecule might influence these processes. Step 5: Related Gene Names: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
