Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCc1nc(C)cn1S(=O)(=O)c1cc(C)c(OC)cc1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is common in many drug molecules that interact with receptors and transporters.
Step 2: The presence of a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) suggests potential interactions with enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a pyrrolidine ring, which might interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like DRD2, HTR2A, and HTR2B, known for their roles in neurotransmission.
Step 4: The overall structure hints at possible binding to ion channels, given the presence of a quinoline ring, which could relate to KCNH2, a potassium channel subunit.
Step 5: Considering the above structural features, the molecule is likely to be related to CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, and KCNH2.
Related gene names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, KCNH2.
