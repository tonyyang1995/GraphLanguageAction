Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH2+]CCC=C1c2ccccc2CCc2ccccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that includes an amine group (-NH2) and a positively charged nitrogen atom, indicating a potential basic functional group. This structural feature suggests the molecule could interact with proteins that have binding sites for basic compounds.
Step 2: The molecule contains a benzene ring (C6H6) with a double bond (C=C), which is characteristic of aromatic compounds. Aromatic compounds often participate in interactions with receptors and transporters that are involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 3: The presence of a benzene ring and the positively charged nitrogen atom in the molecule could indicate potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as those listed as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are known to bind to various ligands including basic amino acids and other small molecules.
Step 4: The molecule also has a pyrrole ring (C4H4N) attached to the benzene ring, which might suggest interactions with enzymes involved in metabolic pathways, such as those encoded by CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are cytochrome P450 enzymes responsible for metabolizing drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and functional groups present in the molecule, it is likely to be related to the genes encoding GPCRs (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) and enzymes involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6). Other genes may also be relevant depending on additional experimental data, but based on the provided information, these are the most likely candidates.
