Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC1(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)CC[NH+](CCCC(=O)c2ccc(F)cc2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) and an amide group (-CONH2), which are common functional groups in many ligands that interact with receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and a substituted benzene ring (with chlorine and fluorine substituents) suggests potential binding sites for proteins such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a quinoline-like structure, which could interact with various enzymes and transporters, including those encoded by CYP2D6 and CYP2C9.
Step 4: The presence of a pyrrolidine ring and a piperidine ring, along with amine functionalities, indicates possible interactions with receptors like HTR2A and HTR2C, which are serotonin receptors.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and functional groups, the molecule may be related to the following genes: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, HTR2A, HTR2C, and HTR6. Step 1: The molecule contains a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) and an amide group (-CONH2), which are common functional groups in many ligands that interact with receptors and enzymes.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and functional groups, the molecule may be related to the following genes: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, HTR2A, HTR2C, and HTR6. 
Summary of related gene names: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, HTR2A, HTR2C, HTR6.
