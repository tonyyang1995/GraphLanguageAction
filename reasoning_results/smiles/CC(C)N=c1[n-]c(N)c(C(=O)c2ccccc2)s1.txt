Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)N=c1[n-]c(N)c(C(=O)c2ccccc2)s1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a tricyclic core structure with a nitrogen atom in the ring, suggesting potential interactions with receptors or enzymes that bind to similar structures. This pattern is often found in molecules that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-CONH-) and a sulfoxide group (-SOX-) indicates the molecule could interact with enzymes such as cytochrome P450s (CYPs), which are involved in drug metabolism. Specifically, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are known to metabolize drugs containing these functional groups.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a pyridine ring and a nitrile group (-CN), which can form hydrogen bonds and other interactions with proteins. These features are relevant for the interaction with genes encoding neurotransmitter receptors like HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are involved in serotonin signaling.
Step 4: The presence of a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) suggests potential interactions with ion channels, particularly those involving calcium channels encoded by genes like KCNH2.
Step 5: Considering the above structural features, the molecule is likely related to the following genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and KCNH2. Step 1: CYP2C9
Step 2: CYP2C19
Step 3: CYP2D6
Step 4: HTR2A
Step 5: HTR2B
Step 6: HTR2C
Step 7: KCNH2
Summary: Related gene names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, KCNH2.
