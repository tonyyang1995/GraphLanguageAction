Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NS(=O)(=O)c1cccc2c1c([N+](=O)[O-])cc1[n-]c(=O)c(=O)[n-]c12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring, which is characteristic of many ligands for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature is relevant to several of the listed genes, such as CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4, which encode muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a phenyl ring with a nitro group (-NO2) attached, which is known to interact with certain drug targets, including some of the enzymes listed, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These cytochrome P450 enzymes are involved in the metabolism of various drugs.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule has an amide group (-CONH2), which is often found in ligands that bind to proteins like DRD2 and DRD3, which encode dopamine receptors.
Step 4: The presence of a quinolone-like structure, particularly the naphthalene core, suggests potential interactions with kinases such as LCK, a tyrosine kinase.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and functional groups present in the molecule, it is likely to have relationships with the genes encoding GPCRs (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6), dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3), and kinases (LCK).
