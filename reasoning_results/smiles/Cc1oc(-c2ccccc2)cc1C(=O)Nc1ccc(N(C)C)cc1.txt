Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1oc(-c2ccccc2)cc1C(=O)Nc1ccc(N(C)C)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that includes a benzene ring, a pyrrole ring, and various substituents such as methyl, ethyl, and amide groups. This structure suggests the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: Looking at the gene list, several genes are related to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which often interact with small molecules through ligand binding. Notable among these are ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6. These genes encode receptors that respond to various neurotransmitters and hormones, suggesting the molecule might target one or more of these receptors.
Step 3: The presence of a benzene ring and amide functionality in the molecule aligns well with the known structures of ligands for GPCRs and other receptor types listed above. Benzene rings are common in many pharmacologically active compounds, while amide groups can form hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues in protein binding sites.
Step 4: Furthermore, the molecule contains a carboxamide group, which is a common functional group in drugs that act as partial agonists or antagonists at GPCRs. This structural feature supports the hypothesis that the molecule may interact with the aforementioned GPCR-related genes.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions with GPCRs, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
