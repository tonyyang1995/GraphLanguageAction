Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Nc1c(C(=O)NCC2CCCO2)c2nc3ccccc3nc2n1-c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system and a pyrrole ring fused to it, which are characteristic features often found in ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural pattern suggests potential interaction with receptors that have similar binding sites.
Step 2: The presence of a pyrrole ring and the overall molecular shape may align well with the binding pocket of receptors like HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are serotonin receptors. These receptors are known to bind molecules with similar aromatic and hydrophobic features.
Step 3: The molecule also includes an amide group (-CONH-) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which could interact with the intracellular domains of certain receptors and enzymes. This could potentially affect receptors involved in signal transduction pathways, such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are dopamine receptors.
Step 4: The presence of multiple nitrogen atoms and the overall size of the molecule might allow it to bind to cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2D6 and CYP2C9, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is most likely to be related to the following genes: HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2D6, and CYP2C9. These genes encode receptors and enzymes that play crucial roles in neurotransmission and drug metabolism.
