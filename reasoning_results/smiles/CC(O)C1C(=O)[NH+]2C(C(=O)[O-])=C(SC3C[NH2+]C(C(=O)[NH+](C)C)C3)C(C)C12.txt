Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(O)C1C(=O)[NH+]2C(C(=O)[O-])=C(SC3C[NH2+]C(C(=O)[NH+](C)C)C3)C(C)C12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring system, an amide group (-CONH), and a quaternary ammonium group (+N(CH3)3). These structural features suggest that the molecule may interact with proteins involved in neurotransmitter transport, receptor binding, or enzymatic activities.
Step 2: The presence of a quaternary ammonium group (+N(CH3)3) indicates potential interactions with ion channels or receptors that have positively charged binding sites, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or ligand-gated ion channels.
Step 3: The amide group (-CONH) suggests the molecule could act as a substrate for enzymes involved in metabolism, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs), which are encoded by CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These enzymes play crucial roles in drug metabolism and can influence pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.
Step 4: Given the presence of a benzene ring system and the overall structure, the molecule might interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, such as kinases. For example, LCK (Lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase) is encoded by the LCK gene and is known to be involved in T-cell signaling.
Step 5: Considering the potential for the molecule to interact with multiple targets, it is likely to affect several genes involved in neurotransmitter systems and receptor functions, including DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), HTR1A (Serotonin receptor 1A), HTR2A (Serotonin receptor 2A), and ESR1 (Estrogen receptor alpha).
Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- ESR1
- LCK
- CYP1A2
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- CACNA1H (Note: This gene was not directly related but mentioned in the original list) Step 5: Summary of related gene names:
Note: CYP1A2 is listed twice, but it is only included once in the final summary. CACNA1H was not directly related based on the provided information. The other genes listed are more likely to be relevant based on the molecular structure and potential interactions.
