Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cn1ccc2cc(NC(=O)Nc3cccnc3)ccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a tricyclic core structure with a pyrrole ring fused to a benzene ring, which is characteristic of many ligands for nuclear receptors and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature suggests potential interactions with genes encoding proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, particularly those related to GPCRs.
Step 2: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) and an amide (-CONH-) within the molecule indicates it could act as an agonist or antagonist for certain receptors, such as adrenergic and muscarinic receptors. This structural motif is often found in compounds that modulate neurotransmitter release or receptor function, which may relate to genes encoding adrenergic and muscarinic receptors.
Step 3: The molecule also has a benzylamine moiety, which is common in ligands for GPCRs, including adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors. This feature might suggest interactions with genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which encode for these types of receptors.
Step 4: Considering the overall structure and functional groups, the molecule could potentially interact with genes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism or signaling pathways. For example, genes like HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode for serotonin receptors, might be relevant due to their involvement in regulating mood and behavior.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the most likely related genes are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes encode for receptors that could interact with the molecule through its structural features. Other genes listed do not have a direct structural or functional relationship with the molecule based on the given SMILES string. 
Related Gene Names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
