Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Clc1ccc(COC(Cn2ccnc2)c2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl)c(Cl)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings and functional groups such as chlorine atoms, aromatic rings, and ester groups. This complexity suggests that the molecule could interact with various biological targets.
Step 2: Upon closer inspection, the presence of a benzene ring with substituents like chlorine and an ester group (CO) indicates potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism and drug transport. Specifically, the ester group might be recognized by enzymes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule contains a pyridine ring, which is often recognized by proteins involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways. This could potentially interact with genes encoding receptors and ion channels, such as HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and KCNH2, which are known to modulate serotonin receptor function and potassium channel activity.
Step 4: The presence of a benzodiazepine-like structure (with a chlorine-substituted phenyl ring and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle) suggests potential interaction with GABAergic systems, which could involve genes such as GABRA1, GABRB1, and GABRD, although these are not listed in the given gene set.
Step 5: Considering the above structural features, the molecule is likely to have interactions with several genes involved in neurotransmission, drug metabolism, and signaling. The related gene names are: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and KCNH2.
