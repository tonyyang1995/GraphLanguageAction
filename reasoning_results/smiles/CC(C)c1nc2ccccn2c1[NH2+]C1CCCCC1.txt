Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)c1nc2ccccn2c1[NH2+]C1CCCCC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring, an amine group (-NH2), and a quinoline ring. The presence of a benzene ring suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in signal transduction or transport processes. The amine group could participate in hydrogen bonding or electrostatic interactions with certain proteins. The quinoline ring might be involved in specific binding sites for receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The benzene ring and amine group are characteristic features that could interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4). These receptors often have benzene rings or aromatic amino acid residues in their binding pockets.
Step 3: The amine group in the molecule could also interact with serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), which typically bind small molecules through hydrogen bonding or hydrophobic interactions involving the amine group.
Step 4: The quinoline ring in the molecule might interact with ion channels (CACNA1H, KCNH2) or other membrane-bound proteins that recognize specific chemical structures due to its planar nature and potential for stacking interactions.
Step 5: Given the structural features of the molecule, it is likely to interact with several GPCRs and ion channels, suggesting possible relationships with the genes ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CACNA1H, and KCNH2.
