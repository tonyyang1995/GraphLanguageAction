Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC[NH+](CC)CCOc1ccc(C(=C(Cl)c2ccccc2)c2ccccc2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a quinolone-like structure, which is characterized by a benzene ring fused to an imidazole ring. This structural feature is known to interact with certain enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The molecule also has a pyridine ring and a pyrrolidine ring connected through an amide bond, which is a common feature in many drugs that act as inhibitors or modulators of various receptors and enzymes.
Step 3: Given the presence of these structural elements, the molecule is likely to interact with enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are part of the cytochrome P450 family and play a significant role in the metabolism of many drugs.
Step 4: Additionally, due to its aromatic nature and potential for hydrogen bonding, the molecule could also interact with ion channels and receptors, such as CACNA1H, which encodes a voltage-gated calcium channel.
Step 5: The molecule's structure does not directly suggest interactions with neurotransmitter receptors like DRD2, HTR2A, or other genes listed that do not have direct structural similarity to the given molecule.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, CACNA1H. The molecule is more likely to be related to enzymes involved in drug metabolism and ion channels rather than neurotransmitter receptors based on its structural features.
