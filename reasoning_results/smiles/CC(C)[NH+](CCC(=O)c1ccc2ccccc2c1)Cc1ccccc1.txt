Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)[NH+](CCC(=O)c1ccc2ccccc2c1)Cc1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a tricyclic amide structure, which is a common feature in many ligands that interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural pattern suggests potential interaction with GPCRs.
Step 2: The presence of a positively charged amine group [NH+] indicates the molecule could act as an agonist or antagonist for receptors that have binding sites for basic amino groups.
Step 3: The tricyclic amide structure and the positively charged nitrogen are likely to interact with receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), which have binding sites for similar molecular motifs.
Step 4: The presence of a pyrrole ring system (c1ccc2ccccc2c1) is characteristic of molecules that can modulate the activity of serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), which often contain aromatic or heteroaromatic rings in their binding sites.
Step 5: The overall structure of the molecule, including its amide and aromatic components, may also be relevant to the function of other GPCRs and enzymes listed, such as DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, and CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
