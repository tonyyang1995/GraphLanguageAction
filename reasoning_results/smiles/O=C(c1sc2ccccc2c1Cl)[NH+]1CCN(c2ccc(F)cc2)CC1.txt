Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(c1sc2ccccc2c1Cl)[NH+]1CCN(c2ccc(F)cc2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring system, which is part of the N-methylated heterocycle structure. This feature is relevant to genes involved in neurotransmitter systems and receptor interactions, such as DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 2: The molecule also has a benzene ring with substituents, including fluorine atoms, which could interact with enzymes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, known for their role in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The presence of a thiazole ring and a pyridine ring suggests potential interactions with genes involved in G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 4: The molecule's overall structure includes a quinoline-like moiety, which might be relevant to genes like CYP3A4, involved in drug metabolism.
Step 5: The molecule does not have direct structural features that are clearly linked to ABCB1, ABL1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CA12, CA2, CA9, CACNA1H, CDK2, CNR1, CYP1A2, EGFR, ESR1, FLT1, HRH1, KDR, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, PPARG, PTGS1, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, KCNH2, and KDR.
Summary of related gene names: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4.
