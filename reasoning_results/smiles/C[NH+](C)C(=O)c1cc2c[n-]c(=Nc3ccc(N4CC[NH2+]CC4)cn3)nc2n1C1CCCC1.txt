Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+](C)C(=O)c1cc2c[n-]c(=Nc3ccc(N4CC[NH2+]CC4)cn3)nc2n1C1CCCC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a nitrogen atom that is part of an amide group (C[NH+](C)C(=O)) and is attached to a benzene ring. This structural feature suggests the molecule could be an inhibitor of enzymes involved in the metabolism of drugs, such as CYP enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a pyrrolidine ring (c1cc2c[n-]c(=Nc3ccc(N4CC[NH2+]CC4)cn3)nc2n1) indicates that the molecule may interact with receptors or ion channels, particularly those that have a similar chemical structure or binding site.
Step 3: The benzene ring system, which is common in many drug molecules, might interact with proteins that contain aromatic residues, such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 4: The molecule’s overall structure does not directly correspond to any of the specific receptors or enzymes listed, but its chemical complexity and potential for binding to multiple targets makes it plausible that it could interact with several of the listed genes, especially those involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction.
Step 5: Given the broad structural features and the potential for interaction with various biological pathways, the related genes could include those involved in neurotransmitter systems and drug metabolism. These include CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), receptors like HTR (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), and kinases like LCK and MCL1.
