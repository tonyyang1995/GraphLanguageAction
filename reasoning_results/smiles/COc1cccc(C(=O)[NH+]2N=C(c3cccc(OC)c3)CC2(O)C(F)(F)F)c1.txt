Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cccc(C(=O)[NH+]2N=C(c3cccc(OC)c3)CC2(O)C(F)(F)F)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple functional groups such as a benzene ring, amide, and ester groups. The presence of these groups suggests that it may interact with proteins involved in signaling pathways, metabolism, and receptor binding.
Step 2: The molecule contains an amide group (-CONH-) which is often found in ligands that bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are a family of proteins that play a crucial role in various physiological processes, including neurotransmission and hormone signaling. This structural feature indicates potential interaction with GPCRs.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a benzene ring and ester group, which can be recognized by enzymes involved in drug metabolism, specifically those encoded by CYP (cytochrome P450) genes. CYP enzymes are responsible for metabolizing many drugs and xenobiotics, making this molecule potentially relevant to CYP-related genes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule has a quaternary ammonium group (+[NH3+]), which can form ion channels or interact with other molecules through electrostatic interactions. This feature might relate to genes encoding ion channel proteins, such as KCNH2, which encodes a potassium channel.
Step 5: Based on the identified functional groups and their potential interactions, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, KCNH2, and possibly other GPCR-encoding genes like DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HRH1.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP1A2
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- KCNH2
- DRD2
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HRH1 Step 5: Summary of related gene names:
- HRH1
These genes are likely to have a relationship with the given molecule due to its structural features and potential interactions. The related genes are primarily involved in drug metabolism (CYP enzymes), ion channel function (KCNH2), and neurotransmitter receptor signaling (DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HRH1). The other genes listed do not have a clear direct relationship based on the molecule's structure.
