Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+]1CCN(c2ccc(N=c3c4ccccc4[n-]c4ccccc34)cc2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge, which suggests it could be an amine or a similar functional group. This feature is relevant to genes involved in neurotransmitter synthesis and metabolism, such as DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), DRD3 (Dopamine receptor D3), and DRD4 (Dopamine receptor D4).
Step 2: The molecule also includes a benzene ring with a nitro group (-NO2) attached, which is characteristic of compounds that can act as ligands for certain receptors or enzymes. This structural feature may relate to genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like HTR1A (Serotonin receptor 1A), HTR2A (Serotonin receptor 2A), and HTR2B (Serotonin receptor 2B).
Step 3: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) indicates potential reactivity with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4.
Step 4: The molecule has multiple aromatic rings, which could interact with proteins involved in cell signaling pathways. This might be relevant to genes like PTGS1 (Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1), which encodes an enzyme involved in inflammation and pain.
Step 5: Given the diverse functional groups and overall structure, the molecule is most likely related to the genes DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and PTGS1. Summary: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, PTGS1.
