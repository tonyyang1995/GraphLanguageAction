Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCC1Oc2ccccc2N(CC(=O)NCCC[NH+]2CCCCC2C)C1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with multiple functional groups including an amide (NCC(=O)N), an aromatic ring (c2cccc2), a ketone (C1=O), and a nitro group (N+). This molecule likely interacts with proteins that have binding sites for these functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of a nitro group (N+) suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways, such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 3: The amide group (NCC(=O)N) indicates possible binding to enzymes or transporters that recognize this functional group, such as CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: The aromatic ring (c2cccc2) could interact with proteins that bind aromatic compounds, such as receptors like DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, which are dopamine receptors, and HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, which are serotonin receptors.
Step 5: Given the complexity of the molecule and its functional groups, it is most likely to interact with a few key genes from the list provided, specifically those involved in neurotransmitter signaling (e.g., adrenergic and serotonergic systems) and drug metabolism (CYP enzymes).
Summary of related gene names:
- ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2
- CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4
- CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4
- DRD2, DRD3, DRD4
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6 Step 5: Summary of related gene names:
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
These genes are related to the molecule due to their involvement in neurotransmitter signaling and drug metabolism. The molecule's structure includes functional groups that are recognized by these proteins, facilitating potential interactions and biological activities.
