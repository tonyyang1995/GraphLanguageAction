Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc(C(=O)Nc2ccc(N3CCOCC3)cc2)c2ccccc2n1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure including a benzene ring system, a pyridine ring, a carboxamide group (-CONH-), and a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring (likely a pyrrole or similar). This structure suggests the molecule may have pharmacological activity, potentially interacting with receptors or enzymes that bind to similar functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH-) indicates the molecule could act as an inhibitor or activator of enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize drugs containing this functional group. These enzymes play key roles in drug metabolism and could be directly affected by the molecule.
Step 3: The nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring might interact with ion channels or receptors that contain similar binding sites, such as those found in HTR2A (serotonin receptor), KCNH2 (potassium channel), and DRD2 (dopamine receptor). These interactions could modulate the function of these proteins, leading to potential therapeutic effects.
Step 4: Given the potential for interaction with enzymes involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6) and receptors (HTR2A, KCNH2, DRD2), it is likely that the molecule could influence the expression or function of genes encoding these proteins, such as those listed: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A, KCNH2, and DRD2.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes are: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A, KCNH2, and DRD2.
