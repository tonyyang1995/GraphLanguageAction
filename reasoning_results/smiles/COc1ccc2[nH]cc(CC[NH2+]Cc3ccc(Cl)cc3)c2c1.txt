Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc2[nH]cc(CC[NH2+]Cc3ccc(Cl)cc3)c2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring system, specifically a pyrrole ring. This feature suggests potential interaction with enzymes that metabolize nitrogen-containing compounds, such as those involved in the cytochrome P450 family (CYP), particularly CYP2C9 and CYP2C19.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a quinoline-like structure, which could indicate potential interactions with receptors or transporters that recognize similar chemical moieties. This might be relevant to genes encoding for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other neurotransmitter receptors.
Step 3: The presence of a nitrile group (-CN) in the molecule may suggest its ability to interact with enzymes involved in the metabolism of nitriles, potentially linking it to genes like CYP2D6.
Step 4: The overall structure and functional groups present in the molecule might influence its affinity for certain ion channels or membrane proteins, such as those encoded by SCN families, which are not directly listed but could be relevant if the molecule interacts with ion channel function.
Step 5: Given the complexity and diverse functional groups in the molecule, it is likely to have multiple points of interaction with various genes, including those involved in drug metabolism (CYP enzymes), receptor signaling pathways, and ion channel function.
