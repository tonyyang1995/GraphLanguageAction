Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N=c1[n-]c(=S)c2ncn(C3OC(CO)C(O)C3O)c2[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a molecule that contains several functional groups such as a nitrile group (-N=C), sulfur-containing heterocycles (thiophene-like structures), and amine functionalities. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in signal transduction, neurotransmission, and drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of amine groups and sulfur-containing heterocycles indicates that this molecule could potentially interact with receptors that have similar functional groups, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are known to be involved in various signaling pathways and are often targets for drugs affecting neurotransmission.
Step 3: Considering the structure of the molecule, it likely has affinity for receptors involved in the regulation of neuronal activity and stress responses, which aligns with the presence of amine and sulfur functionalities. Therefore, it might interact with genes encoding for receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 4: Additionally, given the presence of a thiophene-like structure and the overall chemical profile, the molecule may also influence the activity of enzymes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism and drug metabolism. This suggests potential interactions with genes encoding enzymes like CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize many drugs.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interaction sites, the related genes would include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. These genes encode proteins that play crucial roles in neurotransmission and drug metabolism. 
Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
