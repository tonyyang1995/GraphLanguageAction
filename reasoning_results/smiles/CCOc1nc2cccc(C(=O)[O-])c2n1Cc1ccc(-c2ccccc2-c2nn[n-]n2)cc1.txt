Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOc1nc2cccc(C(=O)[O-])c2n1Cc1ccc(-c2ccccc2-c2nn[n-]n2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a benzene ring system, a pyrrole ring, and an amide group (-CONH-). These structural elements suggest that the molecule could be a ligand or inhibitor for enzymes or receptors involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylate group (-COO-) and an amide (-CONH-) suggests the molecule might interact with proteins that have catalytic or binding sites for these functional groups, such as enzymes or ion channels. 
Step 3: Notably, the molecule includes a quinoline-like moiety (quinoline is a heterocyclic aromatic compound), which is known to be involved in interactions with certain receptors and enzymes, including some G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 4: Given the complex structure with multiple functional groups and aromatic rings, this molecule likely interacts with a variety of targets, but it could potentially modulate the activity of GPCRs like those encoded by ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and DRD2, among others, due to its potential to bind to and influence their conformation or function.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2. 
Note: The exact interaction and mechanism would require further detailed analysis and experimental validation. The listed genes are based on the structural characteristics of the molecule and common pharmacological profiles of similar compounds. Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2. 
These genes encode receptors and ion channels that the molecule might interact with based on its chemical structure. Further research would be needed to confirm these interactions.
