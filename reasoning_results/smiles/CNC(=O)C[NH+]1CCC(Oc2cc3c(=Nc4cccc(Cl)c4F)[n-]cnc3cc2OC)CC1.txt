Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CNC(=O)C[NH+]1CCC(Oc2cc3c(=Nc4cccc(Cl)c4F)[n-]cnc3cc2OC)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring, an amide group (-CONH2), and several other functional groups such as a phenolic hydroxyl group, a fluorine atom, and a cyclic imide. This structure suggests it could interact with proteins involved in neurotransmission, cell signaling, or drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group and a benzene ring indicates potential for interaction with enzymes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics. These enzymes are known to oxidize aromatic rings and hydroxylate phenolic compounds.
Step 3: The amide group (-CONH2) could potentially interact with receptors or ion channels that have similar binding sites, such as DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), HTR2A (Serotonin receptor 5-HT2A), and HRH1 (Histamine receptor H1). These receptors are involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways.
Step 4: The cyclic imide structure might be relevant to the function of certain ion channels or transporters, such as KCNH2 (potassium channel subfamily H member 2), which is associated with cardiac repolarization and can be modulated by various drugs.
Step 5: Given the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes include those involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19), neurotransmission and signaling (DRD2, HTR2A, HRH1), and ion channel regulation (KCNH2).
Summary of related gene names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, DRD2, HTR2A, HRH1, KCNH2.
