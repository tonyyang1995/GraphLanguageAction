Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N[N-]C(=O)c1ccncc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule has a nitrogen-nitrogen bond and contains a pyrrolidine ring, which is characteristic of certain ligands for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). This suggests potential interaction with genes involved in cholinergic signaling.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH-) indicates the molecule could act as an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes that are substrates for such groups, like CYP enzymes. This points towards possible interactions with genes encoding cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Step 3: The aromatic rings and substituents suggest the molecule may interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly those involved in neurotransmission and hormone signaling. This implies potential relevance to genes encoding GPCRs.
Step 4: Given the structure includes a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and amine (-NH2), it could be a substrate for enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism and signaling, pointing to possible interactions with genes like PTGS1.
Step 5: The overall structure and functional groups indicate the molecule might interact with ion channels, neurotransmitter transporters, and receptors involved in neuronal function and signaling pathways. This suggests potential relevance to genes encoding K+ channels (e.g., KCNH2), dopamine receptors (e.g., DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), and other neurotransmitter receptors.
