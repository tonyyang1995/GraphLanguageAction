Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ncoc1-c1nnc(SCCC[NH+]2CC3CC3(c3ccc(C(F)(F)F)cc3F)C2)n1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples.
Step 1: The molecule contains a tricyclic structure with a central benzene ring, which is common in many ligands that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This pattern suggests potential interaction with receptors like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, all of which are GPCRs.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a pyridine ring system, which can form hydrogen bonds and stabilize interactions with certain receptor sites. This feature could potentially interact with receptors such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are dopamine receptors.
Step 3: The presence of a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (N+) and fluorine atoms (-F) indicates a cationic and polar nature, which might enable the molecule to bind to ion channels. Among the listed genes, this could relate to KCNH2, which encodes a potassium channel.
Step 4: The overall chemical complexity and the presence of functional groups like phenols and amides suggest that the molecule could have broad pharmacological activity, potentially interacting with multiple targets including enzymes and transporters. Genes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and SLC6A4, which encode enzymes involved in drug metabolism and transporters, may be relevant.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to interact with several of the listed genes, particularly those encoding GPCRs, ion channels, and enzymes involved in drug metabolism and transport. The related gene names are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, KCNH2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and SLC6A4.
