Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(C(=O)c2ccccc2)c([O-])c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring system, a pyrrole ring fused to it, and a carboxylic acid group attached to another benzene ring. This structure suggests potential interactions with receptors or enzymes that are involved in signal transduction pathways, particularly those related to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes that metabolize drugs.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylic acid group indicates that this molecule could be an inhibitor or substrate for enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics. These enzymes are part of the cytochrome P450 family and play a crucial role in drug metabolism.
Step 3: Given the aromatic nature of the molecule, it might also interact with GPCRs, such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are involved in neurotransmission and are targets for several therapeutic agents. The molecule's ability to bind to these receptors would depend on its specific substituents and overall shape.
Step 4: The molecule's structure does not directly suggest interactions with kinases like LCK or HRH1, which are involved in signal transduction pathways but do not typically have binding sites for molecules with this structural pattern.
Step 5: Based on the analysis, the molecule is most likely related to the following genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4. These genes encode proteins that either metabolize the molecule or are targets for its potential interaction. Summary of related gene names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4. Step 5: Summary of related gene names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4. These genes are most relevant due to their roles in drug metabolism and receptor function.
