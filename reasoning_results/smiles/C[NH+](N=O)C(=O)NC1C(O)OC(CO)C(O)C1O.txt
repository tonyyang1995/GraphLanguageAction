Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+](N=O)C(=O)NC1C(O)OC(CO)C(O)C1O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex structure containing an amide, a ketone, and a carboxylic acid group. These functional groups are characteristic of drugs that interact with receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmission or metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a nitroso group (N=O) suggests the molecule could potentially act as a ligand for certain receptors or enzymes that recognize such functional groups. This is relevant to genes encoding receptors and enzymes that interact with nitrogen-containing compounds.
Step 3: The molecule also contains aromatic rings, which are common in many drug molecules that interact with nuclear receptors or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This indicates potential interactions with genes like those encoding receptors for neurotransmitters or hormones.
Step 4: Given the presence of multiple functional groups and the overall complexity, this molecule likely interacts with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.
Step 5: Considering the neurotransmitter-related functional groups and the presence of multiple binding sites, the molecule may interact with genes encoding neurotransmitter receptors, including HTR2A, HTR2B, and CHRM1.
Summary of related gene names: HTR2A, HTR2B, CHRM1, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. Step 1: The molecule is a complex structure containing an amide, a ketone, and a carboxylic acid group. These functional groups are characteristic of drugs that interact with receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmission or metabolism.
