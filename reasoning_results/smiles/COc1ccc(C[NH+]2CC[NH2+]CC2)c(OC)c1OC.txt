Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(C[NH+]2CC[NH2+]CC2)c(OC)c1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule contains a benzene ring with a nitrogen atom bearing a positive charge (N+), which is common in many small molecule ligands that interact with receptors. This positive charge suggests the molecule could be an agonist or partial agonist for receptors that have a binding site for positively charged groups.
Step 2: The molecule also has a cyclic amine group (N+), which is known to bind to various receptors such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels. These types of molecules are often involved in modulating neurotransmitter activity.
Step 3: Considering the presence of the benzene ring and the cyclic amine, this molecule may interact with receptors like DRD2 (Dopamine Receptor D2), HTR2A (Serotonin Receptor 5-HT1A), and HTR2B (Serotonin Receptor 5-HT2B). These receptors are known to bind to compounds with similar structures due to their aromatic and amine-based binding sites.
Step 4: The presence of the ester (-COO-) and alcohol (-OH) functionalities in the molecule suggests it might also interact with enzymes or receptors that metabolize or recognize these functional groups. This could include CYP enzymes (e.g., CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the most likely related genes are those involved in GPCR signaling pathways (DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), neurotransmitter metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), and receptor function (e.g., ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2).
