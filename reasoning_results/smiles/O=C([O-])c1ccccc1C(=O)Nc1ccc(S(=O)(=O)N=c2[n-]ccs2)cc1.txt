Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])c1ccccc1C(=O)Nc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)N=c2[n-]ccs2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains an acetyl group (-CO-), a carboxylate group (-COO-), and several aromatic rings (cyclohexane-like structures). These functional groups are often involved in binding to enzymes and receptors that play roles in various signaling pathways and metabolic processes.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylate group suggests the molecule could interact with ion channels or receptors that have acidic residues, such as those found in G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and certain ion channels.
Step 3: The aromatic rings indicate potential binding sites for proteins that recognize aromatic residues, which could include various membrane proteins, kinases, and other receptors.
Step 4: Given the complex structure and the presence of a carboxylate group and aromatic rings, this molecule is likely to interact with enzymes and receptors associated with drug metabolism and signaling pathways, such as those involved in GPCR signaling, ion channel function, and kinase activity.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the following genes may be directly or indirectly related to the molecule: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KDR, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
