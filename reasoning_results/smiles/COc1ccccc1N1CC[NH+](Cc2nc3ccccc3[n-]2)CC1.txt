Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccccc1N1CC[NH+](Cc2nc3ccccc3[n-]2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with an amine group (-NH2), a nitrogen atom with a positive charge, and multiple aromatic rings. This structure suggests that the molecule may interact with proteins involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a positively charged nitrogen and aromatic rings indicates potential interactions with ion channels, receptors, and transporters, which are often associated with the genes ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes encode for various types of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels.
Step 3: The molecule also has a pyridine ring system, which could potentially interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6). These enzymes are involved in the metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics, suggesting that the molecule might influence their activity.
Step 4: The presence of a quinoline ring and a carboxamide group (-CONH2) in the molecule might indicate its potential interaction with enzymes such as CYP3A4, which is involved in drug metabolism. Additionally, the presence of a carboxylate group (-COO-) could suggest possible interactions with kinases like CDK2, which is encoded by the CDK2 gene.
Step 5: Given the complex structure and the presence of multiple functional groups, the molecule likely interacts with a variety of targets, including receptors, ion channels, and metabolic enzymes. Based on this analysis, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CDK2.
