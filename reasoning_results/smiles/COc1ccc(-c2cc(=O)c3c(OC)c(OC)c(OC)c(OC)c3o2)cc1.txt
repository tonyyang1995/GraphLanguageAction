Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(-c2cc(=O)c3c(OC)c(OC)c(OC)c(OC)c3o2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule, likely a pharmaceutical compound or an intermediate in drug synthesis. The molecule contains a benzene ring (COc1ccc(-c2cc(=O)c3c(OC)c(OC)c(OC)c(OC)c3o2)cc1), which is common in many drugs due to its aromatic stability and ability to form hydrogen bonds.
Step 2: The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) and ester groups (c2cc(=O)c3c(OC)c(OC)c(OC)c(OC)c3o2) suggests that the molecule may have pharmacological activity involving interactions with enzymes or receptors that recognize such functional groups. These functional groups are often found in compounds that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or other proteins involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 3: The structure includes a benzothiazole moiety (c2cc(=O)c3c(OC)c(OC)c(OC)c(OC)c3o2), which is known to be a component in various drugs, particularly those targeting ion channels, receptors, and enzymes. This part of the molecule could potentially interact with ion channels or receptors like HRH1 (histamine receptor H1), KDR (kinase domain receptor), LCK (Lck tyrosine kinase), or CYP enzymes (cytochrome P450 enzymes).
Step 4: Given the complexity and specific functional groups, this molecule might interact with several genes involved in neurotransmitter systems, signal transduction, and metabolism. For instance, it could influence the expression or function of genes encoding for receptors, ion channels, or enzymes that metabolize the molecule itself or other substances in the body.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the following genes could be related to the molecule: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, SIGMAR1, and SLC6A4. These genes encode for proteins that might directly or indirectly interact with the molecule, either through their role in neurotransmission, receptor signaling, or drug metabolism.
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, SIGMAR1, SLC6A4.
