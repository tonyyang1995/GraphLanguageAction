Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(C2=N[NH+]=C(Nc3ccc(S(=O)(=O)[NH+]4CCOCC4)cc3)SC2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a structure that includes a carboxamide (CON), a benzene ring, and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle. This pattern suggests potential interactions with proteins that have similar chemical structures, particularly those involved in neurotransmission or drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle, such as a pyrrole or a thiazole, indicates that this molecule might interact with receptors or enzymes that have these motifs in their binding sites. Examples include G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Step 3: The molecule contains a thiazole ring, which is a common structural element in many drugs that act on GPCRs. This could suggest a relationship with genes encoding GPCRs, such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are involved in serotonin receptor signaling.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule’s structure may indicate a potential interaction with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, specifically CYP enzymes like CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize various pharmaceuticals.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related genes are likely to be those involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism. The specific genes are: HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Summary of Related Gene Names:
- HTR2A
