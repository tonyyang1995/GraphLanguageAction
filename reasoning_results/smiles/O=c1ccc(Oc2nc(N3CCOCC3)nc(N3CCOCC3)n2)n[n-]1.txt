Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1ccc(Oc2nc(N3CCOCC3)nc(N3CCOCC3)n2)n[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule provided has a structure that includes a benzene ring, an oxygen atom double-bonded to a carbon atom (a ketone group), and several nitrogen atoms with attached substituents such as methyl groups, hydroxyl groups, and other functional groups. This complex structure suggests it could be involved in interactions with proteins that have similar chemical motifs or binding sites.
Step 2: Looking at the genes listed, those related to neurotransmitter systems and receptors are particularly relevant due to their involvement in binding small molecules and modulating cellular signaling pathways. Genes like DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 encode for various subtypes of dopamine receptors and serotonin receptors, which often bind small molecule ligands including agonists and antagonists.
Step 3: The presence of a ketone group and multiple nitrogen atoms in the molecule might indicate potential interactions with enzymes or receptors that contain similar functional groups, such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The gene CYP2D6, which codes for a cytochrome P450 enzyme, could also be relevant if the molecule is metabolized by this enzyme.
Step 4: Considering the pattern of the molecule and the known roles of the genes, the most likely related genes would be those involved in neurotransmission and receptor function. These include DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 5: Summary of related genes: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6. These genes encode for dopamine receptors and serotonin receptors, respectively, which are known to interact with small molecules that bind to them, potentially explaining the molecule’s possible interaction with these genes based on its chemical structure.
