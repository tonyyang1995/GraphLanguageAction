Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc(-c2nc3ccccc3s2)ccc1[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that includes a benzene ring system, a sulfur atom, and a negatively charged oxygen atom. This structure suggests the molecule could interact with proteins involved in signaling pathways, transport, and metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring, sulfur atom, and negative charge indicates potential for interaction with enzymes and receptors. Benzene rings are common in many drug molecules due to their ability to form stable interactions with proteins. Sulfur atoms can participate in covalent bonding and form hydrogen bonds, which are important for binding to proteins.
Step 3: Given the structure, the molecule might be related to enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which metabolize many drugs and xenobiotics. The sulfur atom could also suggest a possible interaction with receptors like GPCRs (e.g., DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), which often have cysteine residues that can form disulfide bridges or interact with ligands containing sulfur.
Step 4: The negatively charged oxygen atom could indicate an acidic functional group, which might interact with basic residues in protein binding sites, suggesting potential interactions with ion channels (e.g., KCNH2) or other membrane-bound proteins.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related genes are likely to be those involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmission, and receptor signaling. These include CYP enzymes, GPCRs (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), and ion channels (KCNH2).
