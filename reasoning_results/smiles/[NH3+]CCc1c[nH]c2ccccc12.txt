Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [NH3+]CCc1c[nH]c2ccccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this relationship matters.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (NH3+), indicating it has basic properties.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a benzene ring (CC) with multiple substituents, suggesting potential interactions with receptors or transporters that have aromatic structures.
Step 3: The presence of a pyrrolidine ring ([nH]) may indicate the molecule could interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or ion channels, which often contain similar ring structures.
Step 4: Considering the pattern of substituents around the benzene ring and the pyrrolidine ring, the molecule might interact with receptors or enzymes that are involved in neurotransmitter signaling, such as dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) and serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Step 5: The molecule's structure could also potentially interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), given its complex aromatic and heterocyclic nature.
