Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CNC(=O)c1ccc(N=c2[n-]cc(C(F)(F)F)c(=NCc3nccnc3N(C)S(C)(=O)=O)[n-]2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring, a pyridine ring, and a tetrazole ring, among other functional groups. This structure suggests potential interactions with receptors or enzymes that are involved in neurotransmission, signal transduction, or drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a tetrazole ring and a pyridine ring in the molecule indicates a potential interaction with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which often have binding sites for ligands containing similar aromatic rings. Examples of such receptors include the adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 3: The molecule also contains a thiazole ring and a sulfonamide group, which are known to interact with various ion channels and transporters. For instance, the calcium channel CACNA1H and the proton pump inhibitor target SLC6A2 might be affected by this molecule due to their specific binding preferences.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule has a pyridine ring attached to a carboxamide group, suggesting it could potentially inhibit enzymes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are known to metabolize many drugs and are encoded by the CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 genes.
Step 5: Given the above structural features, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism, including: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CACNA1H, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19.
Summary of related gene names:
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- ADRB2
- CHRM1
- CHRM3
- CHRM4
- CACNA1H
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19 Step 5: Given the above structural features, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism, including: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CACNA1H, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. 
- CYP2C19
These genes are primarily involved in receptor function and drug metabolism, making them the most relevant based on the molecule's structural features.
