Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(CCNC(=O)Cc2cc(OC)c(OC)cc2[N+](=O)[O-])cc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex molecule with multiple functional groups and rings, including a benzene ring, a pyrrolidine ring, and an amide group. This structure suggests the molecule could be involved in interactions with receptors or enzymes that bind to or modify such functional groups.
Step 2: Analyzing the pattern of the molecule, it contains an amide group (-CO-NH-) which is characteristic of drugs that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Specifically, the amide group could potentially interact with receptors like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are dopamine receptors, and HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are serotonin receptors.
Step 3: The presence of a benzene ring and other aromatic functionalities indicates potential binding sites for enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 4: The molecule also includes a quaternary ammonium group, which is characteristic of agonists or antagonists for receptors like CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4, which are muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.
Step 5: Given the above structural features, the molecule is likely to have relationships with the following genes: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4.
