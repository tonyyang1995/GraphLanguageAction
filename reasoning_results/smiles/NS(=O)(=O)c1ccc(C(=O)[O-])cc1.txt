Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(C(=O)[O-])cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule, represented by the SMILES string "NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(C(=O)[O-])cc1", is a N-substituted glycineamide (NSGA) derivative. This class of compounds is known for their potential to act as modulators of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly those involved in neurotransmission and pain modulation.
Step 2: The structure includes a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH) which is a common functional group in drugs that interact with GPCRs. The presence of this group suggests that the molecule may have an affinity for GPCRs, especially those that are activated or inhibited by such moieties.
Step 3: The pattern of the molecule also includes a benzene ring, which is a common feature in many drug molecules. Benzene rings often serve as a scaffold for binding to protein targets, including GPCRs. This structural element further supports the hypothesis that the molecule could interact with GPCRs.
Step 4: Considering the pattern and functional groups, the molecule is likely to interact with GPCRs, specifically those involved in neurotransmitter release and pain signaling. Given this, the related genes would be those encoding GPCRs that are involved in these processes.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the related genes include: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CNR1, and OPRK1. These genes encode GPCRs that play crucial roles in neurotransmission and pain perception.
