Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(-c2csc(=NC(=O)c3ccno3)[n-]2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples.
Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings, including a benzene ring, a pyrrole ring, and a thiophene ring. This structure suggests that the molecule could interact with enzymes or receptors that have similar structural preferences.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) and a nitroso group (-N=O) indicates potential for forming hydrogen bonds or other types of interactions with amino acid residues in protein binding sites. These functional groups are commonly found in molecules that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which include some of the listed genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a carboxamide group (-CONH2), which is often involved in forming hydrogen bonds and can be recognized by enzymes such as those encoded by the CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 genes, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: The overall size and shape of the molecule, along with its functional groups, suggest it might fit into the active site of enzymes or receptors. Given the presence of aromatic rings and heteroatoms, it could potentially bind to proteins like those encoded by CYP3A4, which metabolizes various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 5: Considering the structural features described, the molecule is likely to interact with a few of the listed genes, particularly those involved in GPCR signaling pathways and drug metabolism. The related gene names are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4. 
Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
