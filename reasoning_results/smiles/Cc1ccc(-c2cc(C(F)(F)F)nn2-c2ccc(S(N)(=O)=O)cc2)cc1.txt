Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(-c2cc(C(F)(F)F)nn2-c2ccc(S(N)(=O)=O)cc2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this relationship is important.
Step 1: The molecule contains a tricyclic core structure with a fluorine-substituted benzene ring and a sulfonamide group attached to it. This structural pattern suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O) indicates that the molecule may interact with enzymes such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are known to metabolize sulfonamides and other similar compounds.
Step 3: The fluorine substituents (F) present in the molecule could also indicate potential binding to proteins like CYP1A2, which is involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics including those with fluorine substitutions.
Step 4: Given the presence of aromatic rings and heteroatoms, the molecule might have affinity for receptors such as DRD2 and HTR2A, which are involved in neurotransmission and are known to bind to various ligands.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and functional groups, the molecule could potentially interact with enzymes and receptors related to GABAergic and dopaminergic signaling pathways, which include GABAA receptors (which may be influenced by CYP enzymes) and dopamine receptors (such as DRD2 and HTR2A).
Summary of related genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, DRD2, HTR2A Step 1: The molecule has a tricyclic core structure with a fluorine-substituted benzene ring and a sulfonamide group. This pattern suggests potential interaction with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O) indicates possible interaction with CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which metabolize sulfonamides.
Step 3: Fluorine substituents (F) suggest potential binding to CYP1A2, which metabolizes xenobiotics with fluorine.
Step 4: Aromatic rings and heteroatoms imply possible receptor binding, particularly to DRD2 and HTR2A involved in neurotransmission.
Step 5: The overall structure suggests interactions with GABAergic and dopaminergic signaling pathways, involving CYP enzymes and receptors.
