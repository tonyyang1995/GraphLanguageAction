Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C=CCn1c(SCC(=O)Nc2ccc(-c3nc4ccc(C)cc4s3)cc2)nnc1-c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex molecule with multiple functional groups including a benzene ring, a nitrile group (-CN), an amide group (-CONH-), and a nitroso group (-N=O). The presence of these functional groups suggests that the molecule may have pharmacological activity.
Step 2: Given the structure and functional groups, we can infer that this molecule might interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, receptor binding, or enzymatic activities due to its diverse chemical functionalities. 
Step 3: Looking at the genes listed, several are known to encode receptors or enzymes that could potentially interact with such a molecule. For instance, ADRB2 (beta-2 adrenergic receptor) and DRD2 (dopamine D2 receptor) both play roles in signal transduction pathways and could be targeted by molecules with the described structure.
Step 4: Additionally, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 are cytochrome P450 enzymes that metabolize many drugs and xenobiotics, which means they could be affected by the presence of this molecule, altering its metabolism and efficacy.
Step 5: Therefore, the molecule could be related to ADRB2, DRD2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 based on its structure and potential interactions.
Summary of related gene names: ADRB2, DRD2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
