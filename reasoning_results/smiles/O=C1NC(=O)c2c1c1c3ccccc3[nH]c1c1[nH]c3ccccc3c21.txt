Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C1NC(=O)c2c1c1c3ccccc3[nH]c1c1[nH]c3ccccc3c21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings, including benzene and pyrrole rings, which are characteristic of many drug-like molecules. This complexity suggests that the molecule may interact with proteins involved in signal transduction or receptor binding.
Step 2: The presence of a pyrrole ring and a quinoline-like system (indicated by the nH groups) is indicative of potential interactions with enzymes such as CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs. These enzymes are known to oxidize substrates at various positions, often at aromatic rings like those found in the molecule.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a carbamate group (-CONH-) and a nitrile group (-CN), which could suggest interactions with receptors that recognize similar functional groups, such as HTR2A (serotonin 5-HT2A receptor) and HTR2B (serotonin 5-HT2B receptor). These receptors are involved in neurotransmission and are targets for psychiatric medications.
Step 4: Given the presence of nitrogen atoms within the molecule and the overall structure, it might also interact with ion channels or transporters. For example, the molecule could potentially affect KCNH2 (hERG potassium channel) or SLC6A4 (norepinephrine transporter), which are involved in ion regulation and neurotransmitter reuptake.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and potential interactions, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes involved in neurotransmission, metabolism, and ion regulation, including: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, HTR2A, HTR2B, KCNH2, and SLC6A4. 
Summary of Related Gene Names:
- CYP2D6
