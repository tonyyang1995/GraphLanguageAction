Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(-c2cnnn2-c2ccc(NC(=O)c3ccco3)cc2)cc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule is a complex organic compound that includes a benzene ring system, an oxazolone moiety, and a lactam structure. The presence of a lactam (a cyclic amide) suggests the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes that interact with such functional groups, like certain cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Step 2: The molecule contains a quinoline-like structure within its lactam ring, which is characteristic of compounds that may act as inhibitors of various enzymes involved in drug metabolism. Specifically, this feature could relate to CYP2D6, an important enzyme in the metabolism of many drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: The molecule also has a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring, which might indicate it could bind to receptors containing similar functional groups, such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This could potentially interact with genes encoding for GPCRs, such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are known to be involved in neurotransmission.
Step 4: Given the presence of a nitro group (-NO2), the molecule could have potential interactions with enzymes that metabolize such compounds, like those encoded by the CYP2E1 gene, although CYP2E1 is not listed among the provided genes.
Step 5: The overall structure does not directly suggest interactions with other listed genes such as ABCB1, ABL1, or PTGS1, as there are no obvious structural motifs that would specifically target these proteins.
Summary of Related Gene Names:
- CYP2D6
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C Step 1: The provided molecule is a complex organic compound with multiple functional groups including benzene rings, oxazolone moieties, and lactams.
Step 2: The presence of a lactam structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes like CYP2D6, which metabolizes drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: The nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring in the molecule might allow for binding to GPCRs, specifically HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, involved in neurotransmission.
Step 4: The nitro group (-NO2) indicates possible interactions with enzymes like CYP2E1, though this enzyme is not in the given list.
Step 5: No direct interaction is expected with other listed genes such as ABCB1, ABL1, or PTGS1 based on the molecule’s structure.
- HTR2C
The molecule is likely to interact with CYP2D6 and certain serotonin receptors (HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C). Other genes listed are less likely to be directly related due to the molecular structure.
