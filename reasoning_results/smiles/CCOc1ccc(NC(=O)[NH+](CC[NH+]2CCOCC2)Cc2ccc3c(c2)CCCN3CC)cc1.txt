Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)[NH+](CC[NH+]2CCOCC2)Cc2ccc3c(c2)CCCN3CC)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring, a pyridine ring, and a benzene ring, suggesting it has a complex aromatic structure. This structural complexity could potentially interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways and receptor binding.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-CONH2) and a carboxylate group (-COOH) indicates the molecule could act as both a ligand and a substrate for enzymes. This suggests possible interactions with enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a quinoline moiety, which is known to interact with receptors and transporters. This feature may relate to the genes ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, and DRD2, all of which encode for G-protein coupled receptors.
Step 4: The presence of a nitrophenol group might suggest potential interactions with enzymes involved in detoxification pathways, such as CYP1A2 and PTGS1 (COX-2), which are related to the metabolism and signaling of pro-inflammatory mediators.
Step 5: Given the overall structure and functional groups, the molecule may have interactions with multiple genes, including CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP1A2, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, PTGS1, and others.
