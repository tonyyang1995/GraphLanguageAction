Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cccc(N(C)C(=S)Oc2ccc3ccccc3c2)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule has a complex structure with several rings, including a benzene ring and a thiophene ring, connected through nitrogen atoms and sulfur atoms. This structural complexity suggests potential interactions with proteins that have similar chemical structures or functional groups.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of a nitro group (N) and a sulfoxide group (=S) could be particularly relevant for drug metabolism enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize compounds containing these functional groups. These enzymes play crucial roles in the biotransformation of drugs, potentially affecting their efficacy and toxicity.
Step 3: Additionally, the thiophene ring and the sulfur atom might interact with receptors or ion channels, such as those encoded by genes like CACNA1H (calcium channel, voltage-dependent, alpha 1H subunit), which could influence calcium signaling pathways. This interaction could also be relevant for genes involved in neurotransmitter release and receptor function, such as HTR1A (serotonin receptor 1A) and HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A).
Step 4: Furthermore, the overall structure of the molecule, with its aromatic rings and polar functional groups, may engage in binding to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2) and DRD3 (dopamine receptor D3), which are involved in various physiological processes, including neurotransmission and mood regulation.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions with various biological targets, the most likely related genes are: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CACNA1H, HTR1A, HTR2A, DRD2, and DRD3. These genes encode proteins that are directly involved in drug metabolism, ion channel function, and neurotransmission, making them the most probable candidates for interaction with the described molecule. Step 1: The molecule contains a complex structure with multiple rings, including benzene and thiophene, along with nitrogen and sulfur atoms.
Step 2: The presence of a nitro group (N) and a sulfoxide group (=S) indicates potential interactions with drug-metabolizing enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 3: The thiophene ring and sulfur atom suggest possible interactions with ion channels, such as CACNA1H, and neurotransmitter receptors, including HTR1A and HTR2A.
Step 4: The aromatic nature and polar functional groups of the molecule could bind to G-protein coupled receptors like DRD2 and DRD3.
Step 5: The most likely related genes are: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CACNA1H, HTR1A, HTR2A, DRD2, and DRD3.
