Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc(C(C)(C)C)cc(C)c1CC1=[NH+]CCN1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a quinolone-like structure with a fused pyridine ring, which is characteristic of many ABL1 inhibitors.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom double-bonded to a carbon (N=C) and a nitro group (-NO2) suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2D6 and CYP3A4.
Step 3: The aromatic amine group (-NH-) and the presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH-) indicate possible interactions with receptors like HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are serotonin receptors.
Step 4: The benzene rings and alkyl chains suggest potential binding to proteins like CACNA1H, which is a calcium channel, and CYP1A2, which is involved in phase I metabolism.
Step 5: The molecule's overall structure and functional groups could interact with various G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), including DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are dopamine receptors.
