Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1nc2sc(C(=O)NC3CCCCC3)c(N)c2c(C)c1Cl, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure including a benzene ring, amide group, and various functional groups such as carbonyl, carboxyl, and amine. These features suggest the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (C(=O)N) indicates the molecule might interact with enzymes or receptors that have amine binding sites, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). The molecule also contains a benzene ring, which is common in many drug molecules due to its aromaticity and ability to form hydrogen bonds.
Step 3: Given the potential for interaction with GPCRs, the molecule may be related to genes encoding for these receptors. Specifically, it could potentially interact with adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), and serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a carboxylic acid group and amide functionality suggests the molecule could be involved in interactions with enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are known to metabolize many drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and potential interactions, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. 
Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
