Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH2+]C1(C)C2CCC(C2)C1(C)C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this might be clinically relevant.
Step 1: The molecule has an amine group (-NH2) attached to a nitrogen atom which is positively charged, indicating it is an amine salt. This functional group is known to interact with certain receptors and ion channels.
Step 2: The presence of multiple benzene rings (indicated by the "C" characters in the SMILES string) suggests the molecule could be a ligand for proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The cyclic structure and the presence of methyl groups suggest the molecule may interact with enzymes involved in metabolism, like those encoded by CYP2C9 and CYP2D6.
Step 4: Given the overall structure, the molecule likely interacts with neurotransmitter receptors, including HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are encoded by the HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C genes respectively.
Step 5: The molecule also has potential interactions with enzymes involved in prostaglandin synthesis, such as PTGS1, which is encoded by the PTGS1 gene.
Summary of related genes: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, PTGS1. Step 1: The molecule has an amine group (-NH2) attached to a nitrogen atom which is positively charged, indicating it is an amine salt. This functional group is known to interact with certain receptors and ion channels.
Step 2: The presence of multiple benzene rings suggests the molecule could be a ligand for proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Summary of related genes: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, PTGS1. Step 1: The molecule contains an amine group (-NH2) that can form hydrogen bonds, which may interact with proteins such as receptors or ion channels.
Step 2: The benzene rings present in the molecule suggest it could act as a ligand for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are involved in various signaling pathways.
Step 3: The cyclic structure and presence of methyl groups indicate potential interactions with metabolic enzymes, specifically those involved in drug metabolism such as CYP2C9 and CYP2D6.
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule implies it may interact with neurotransmitter receptors, particularly those encoded by HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are involved in modulating
