Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N=c1[n-]c(=NCCc2ccc([O-])cc2)nc2[n-]c(-c3ccco3)nn12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen-nitrogen double bond (N=N), indicating it could be an amine or amide derivative, which often interact with receptors that have amino acid binding sites, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This suggests potential interactions with genes encoding GPCRs.
Step 2: The molecule also has a nitro group (-NO2) and an oxygen-containing heterocycle (likely an oxazole or thiazole ring), which are common functional groups in drugs that target enzymes or receptors involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways. This indicates possible interactions with genes encoding proteins involved in these pathways.
Step 3: The presence of multiple nitrogen atoms, including amines and amides, suggests the molecule may interact with enzymes that metabolize drugs, such as CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are encoded by the respective genes.
Step 4: Given the pattern of the molecule, it could potentially act as a ligand for receptors that modulate neurotransmitter release or uptake, such as HTRs (serotonin receptors) and DRDs (dopamine receptors). This implies potential interactions with genes encoding these receptors (e.g., HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4).
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and functional groups, the molecule might interact with enzymes or receptors involved in signal transduction and cell signaling pathways, such as those encoded by the genes EGFR, PTGS1, and KCNH2.
