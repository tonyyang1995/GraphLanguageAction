Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cn1cccc1Cc1nnc(SCC(=O)Nc2ccc(F)cc2)n1CCc1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that contains aromatic rings, heteroatoms (such as nitrogen and sulfur), and functional groups like amides and esters. This structural complexity suggests the molecule could interact with multiple biological targets, including enzymes and receptors.
Step 2: Analyzing the potential pharmacological activities of this molecule, it likely interacts with enzymes involved in metabolism due to its presence of functional groups such as esters and amides. This is particularly relevant for genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize various drugs through oxidation reactions involving these functional groups.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule's structure might allow it to bind to receptors. Notably, it could potentially interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) given its size and the presence of aromatic rings. Genes encoding GPCRs include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, all of which are involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways.
Step 4: The molecule’s structure also hints at possible interactions with ion channels and transporters, which could be relevant for genes like KCNH2, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4, involved in sodium channel function and neurotransmitter reuptake, respectively.
Step 5: Based on the analysis, the molecule is most likely to be related to several genes involved in metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6) and neurotransmission/receptor activity (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, SLC6A2, SLC6A4).
Summary of related gene names:
- Metabolism: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6
- Neurotransmission/Receptor Activity: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
