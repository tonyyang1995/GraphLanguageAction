Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(C(C)C(=O)[NH+]2CCC(n3nc(-c4ccccc4)oc3=O)CC2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with multiple substituents, including a carboxamide group and a quaternary ammonium salt. These functional groups suggest potential interactions with receptors or enzymes that have binding sites for similar chemical structures.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group and a quaternary ammonium salt indicates possible interactions with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which often bind amine-containing molecules and can modulate neurotransmitter release or receptor signaling.
Step 3: Among the listed genes, several are known to encode GPCRs: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These receptors could be directly targeted by the molecule due to its chemical structure.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule may interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are listed among the genes. These enzymes are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics, and their activity could be affected by the molecule’s structure.
Step 5: Based on the molecule’s structure and potential interactions, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6.
