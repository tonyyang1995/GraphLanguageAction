Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCC[NH+]1CCOC2c3cc([O-])ccc3OCC21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure containing a central amine group (NH+) connected to a linear alkyl chain (CCC) and a cyclic ester (COCC). The presence of an amine group suggests potential for interaction with receptors that have positively charged binding sites.
Step 2: The cyclic ester (COCC) in the molecule could act as a ligand for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are known to bind to various small molecules and ions. This feature is particularly relevant to the adrenergic receptors ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, and the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4, as they all have the capacity to bind to cyclic esters and other small molecules.
Step 3: The linear alkyl chain (CCC) of the molecule may also interact with the transmembrane domains of GPCRs, contributing to the overall binding affinity. This interaction is especially significant for the dopamine receptor DRD2, serotonin receptors HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, as well as the opioid receptor OPRK1, which all have transmembrane domains that can interact with long hydrophobic ligands.
Step 4: The presence of an amine group (NH+) in the molecule could also indicate potential for binding to ion channels, such as the calcium channel CACNA1H and the potassium channel KCNH2, which both have positively charged binding sites that can be occupied by amines.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis of the molecule, it is most likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, OPRK1, CACNA1H, and KCNH2.
