Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Cn1ccc2ccccc2c1=O)[NH+]1CCN(c2cccc(Cl)c2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple functional groups such as an amide (N-C=O), a benzene ring, and a pyrrolidine ring. These structural elements suggest the molecule could interact with proteins that have similar chemical properties or binding sites.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of a benzene ring and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (pyrrolidine) suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism and signaling pathways, particularly those associated with drug metabolism and neurotransmission.
Step 3: Among the listed genes, several are known to be involved in drug metabolism or neurotransmission. CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 are all cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the metabolism of many drugs, which could interact directly with the molecule due to its structural complexity.
Step 4: Additionally, HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A) and HTR2B (serotonin receptor 2B) are involved in neurotransmission and could potentially bind to the molecule given its amine and benzene functionalities, which are common in serotonin receptor ligands.
Step 5: Therefore, the molecule is likely related to the genes CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, HTR2A, and HTR2B based on their roles in drug metabolism and neurotransmission. 
Summary of related gene names: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B.
