Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)c1cc(CN=c2nc(N3CC[NH+](C)CC3)cc(N=c3cc(C4CC4)[n-][n-]3)[n-]2)on1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule containing several functional groups such as amine (-NH2), imine (-N=C-), and aromatic rings (cyclohexane-like structures). This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for similar functional groups or aromatic regions.
Step 2: Given the presence of an amide group (-CONH-) and an imine group (-N=C-), the molecule could interact with proteins that have amino acid residues capable of forming hydrogen bonds or electrostatic interactions with these functional groups. Additionally, the aromatic nature of the molecule might allow it to bind to proteins with hydrophobic pockets or regions.
Step 3: Considering the potential interactions described, the molecule might be related to genes encoding receptors or transporters that have specific binding sites for ligands with similar chemical properties. For example, the imine and amide groups suggest possible interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: Among the listed genes, those encoding GPCRs and enzymes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism are particularly relevant. Specifically, HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A), HTR2B (serotonin receptor 2B), and HTR2C (serotonin receptor 2C) are GPCRs that might interact with the molecule due to its amine and imine functionalities. Additionally, CYP2D6, which encodes a cytochrome P450 enzyme involved in drug metabolism, could also be related due to the presence of functional groups that could be metabolized by this enzyme.
Step 5: Based on the analysis, the related genes are: HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and CYP2D6.
Summary of related gene names:
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- CYP2D6
