Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])C1(Nc2ccccc2)CC[NH+](Cc2ccccc2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound with a central carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen (O=C), a negatively charged oxygen (-O-), and two aromatic rings (c2ccccc2). The molecule also contains amine and carboxyl functionalities, which are characteristic of many bioactive compounds.
Step 2: Analyzing the gene list provided, we identify several genes that are involved in neurotransmitter systems, receptor signaling, and drug metabolism. These include HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.
Step 3: The molecule's structure suggests potential interactions with receptors and enzymes listed among the genes. For instance, the amine group could interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and CHRM1-4, which are involved in neurotransmission. The presence of a carboxyl group and the overall complexity of the molecule indicate it might be a substrate for enzymes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are involved in phase I drug metabolism.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of an oxygenated aromatic ring and a negatively charged functional group suggest the molecule may have affinity for ion channels or transporters, possibly interacting with KDR (a tyrosine kinase receptor) or SLC6A4 (a serotonin transporter).
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions with the listed genes, the related genes can be summarized as: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, KDR, and SLC6A4. These genes are primarily involved in neurotransmission, receptor signaling, and drug metabolism.
