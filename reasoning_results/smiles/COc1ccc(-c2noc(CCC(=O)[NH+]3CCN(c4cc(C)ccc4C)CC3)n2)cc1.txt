Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(-c2noc(CCC(=O)[NH+]3CCN(c4cc(C)ccc4C)CC3)n2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule provided has a complex structure that includes a benzene ring, a pyridine ring, and several functional groups such as amide, carboxyl, and nitro groups. The presence of these functional groups suggests potential interactions with various enzymes and receptors involved in signal transduction and metabolism.
Step 2: Among the given genes, those primarily involved in metabolism and drug transport are more likely to interact with this molecule due to its functional groups. Specifically, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 are cytochrome P450 enzymes that metabolize many drugs and xenobiotics. These enzymes would be directly affected by the molecule's structure, particularly the amide and carboxyl groups which are common substrates for these enzymes.
Step 3: Additionally, ABCB1 (also known as P-glycoprotein) is an ATP-binding cassette transporter that is known to efflux certain drugs from cells. The presence of the nitro group in the molecule could potentially make it a substrate for ABCB1, leading to increased drug resistance in cells expressing this protein.
Step 4: Furthermore, the molecule's structure might also interact with receptors involved in neurotransmission and hormone signaling. For instance, HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A) and ESR1 (estrogen receptor alpha) are both involved in signal transduction pathways. The presence of functional groups like amides and carboxylic acids could allow the molecule to bind to these receptors, potentially modulating their activity.
Step 5: Given the above considerations, the genes related to the molecule are CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ABCB1, HTR2A, and ESR1. These genes play crucial roles in drug metabolism, transport, and signal transduction, making them likely candidates for interaction with the described molecule.
