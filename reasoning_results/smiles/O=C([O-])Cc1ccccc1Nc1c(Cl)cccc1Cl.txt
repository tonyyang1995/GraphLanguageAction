Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])Cc1ccccc1Nc1c(Cl)cccc1Cl, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a structure that includes an oxygen double-bonded to a carbon atom (O=C), which is characteristic of a ketone group. This functional group is often involved in interactions with receptors and enzymes. The presence of this ketone suggests potential interaction with genes involved in metabolic pathways or receptor binding.
Step 2: The molecule also contains a nitrogen atom within a ring structure (Nc1c(Cl)cccc1Cl), which indicates the presence of a heterocyclic compound. Heterocyclic compounds are known to interact with various proteins and enzymes, particularly those involved in signal transduction pathways and neurotransmitter systems.
Step 3: Given the presence of chlorine atoms (Cl) in the molecule, it could potentially interact with genes associated with drug metabolism and transport, such as CYP enzymes (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) due to their role in metabolizing xenobiotics.
Step 4: The molecule also has a benzene ring (Cc1ccccc1) attached to a nitro group (NO2), which could indicate potential interactions with genes involved in inflammatory responses or cell signaling, such as PTGS1 (COX-2), which is involved in prostaglandin synthesis.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and functional groups present in the molecule, it appears to have the potential to interact with genes involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction, including HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6 (serotonin receptors), and CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4 (muscarinic acetylcholine receptors).
