Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(CSc1ncnc2c1oc1ccccc12)c1cccs1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings, including a benzene ring (CSc1ncnc2c1) and a furan ring (O=C(CS)). This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in signal transduction and receptor binding.
Step 2: The presence of sulfur (S) and oxygen (O) atoms, along with the aromatic nature of the molecule, indicates that it may interact with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP (cytochrome P450) genes. CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are known to metabolize drugs with similar structural features.
Step 3: The cyclic nature of the molecule and its potential for hydrogen bonding due to the presence of oxygen and nitrogen atoms could suggest interactions with receptors like adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B) and dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), which are involved in neurotransmission.
Step 4: Given the presence of a benzene ring and the possibility of aromatic amine groups, the molecule might interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as HRH1 (histamine H1 receptor) and HTR2A (serotonin 5-HT2A receptor), which are known to bind to various ligands with similar structures.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and potential functional groups, this molecule could also be related to the enzyme PTGS1 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1), which is involved in prostaglandin biosynthesis and is known to interact with molecules containing similar functional groups.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- DRD2
- DRD3

These genes are related to the molecule through their involvement in drug metabolism, neurotransmission, and enzymatic functions. The detailed explanation focuses on the molecular structure and its potential interactions with these genes' encoded proteins. The final list includes only the genes directly related to the molecule based on the provided information. 
Note: The gene names listed are based on the assumption that the molecule might interact with these proteins or enzymes. Actual interactions would require further experimental validation. The summary includes the genes mentioned in the instruction without adding any not mentioned in the given list.
