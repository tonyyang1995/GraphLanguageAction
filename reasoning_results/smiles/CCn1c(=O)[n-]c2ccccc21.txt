Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCn1c(=O)[n-]c2ccccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a structure that includes a pyrrole ring (indicated by the 'n' symbol) and an amide group (-CO-N), which suggests it could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors involved in neurotransmission or signaling pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring (indicated by 'C') and the substitution pattern (n1c(=O)[n-]c2ccccc21) suggest the molecule may interact with proteins that contain transmembrane domains or are involved in ion transport or receptor activity.
Step 3: Considering the structure, the molecule might be relevant to genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to its potential to bind to these receptors. GPCRs are known to play crucial roles in various physiological processes and are often targeted by drugs.
Step 4: Among the provided genes, several are associated with GPCRs or enzymes that could be influenced by molecules with similar structures. These include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 5: The molecule's structure and potential interactions with these genes indicate a possible role in modulating neurotransmitter systems and possibly other signaling pathways.
