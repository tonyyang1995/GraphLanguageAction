Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C1C(=O)c2cccc3cccc1c23, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a structure that includes a benzene ring (cyclic aromatic group) attached to a carbonyl group (C=O), which is characteristic of many drugs that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This suggests potential interactions with genes encoding for GPCRs.
Step 2: The cyclic structure and the presence of multiple rings indicate that this molecule might be involved in modulating ion channels or receptors that are sensitive to structural complexity. This aligns with the presence of genes such as KCNH2, which encodes for a potassium channel subunit, and HRH1, which encodes for histamine receptor H1.
Step 3: Given the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and the overall structure, this molecule could potentially act as an agonist or antagonist for receptors that have acidic functionalities, such as adrenergic receptors. This points towards genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, and CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, which encode for adrenergic and cholinergic receptors.
Step 4: The molecule’s structure also hints at possible involvement in enzymatic pathways, particularly those involving cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP enzymes) due to its complex aromatic structure. This suggests a relationship with CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize various xenobiotics and drugs.
Step 5: Considering the potential for this molecule to influence neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways, it may interact with genes involved in neurotransmitter receptors and signaling cascades. This includes genes such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which encode for serotonin and dopamine receptors.
Summary of related gene names:
- KCNH2
- HRH1
- ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2
- CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4
- CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4
These genes are primarily associated with ion channels, adrenergic and cholinergic receptors, and neurotransmitter receptors/signaling pathways.
