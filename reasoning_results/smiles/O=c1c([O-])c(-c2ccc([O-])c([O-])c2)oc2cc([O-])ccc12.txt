Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1c([O-])c(-c2ccc([O-])c([O-])c2)oc2cc([O-])ccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound containing a central carbon atom double-bonded to a carbon atom, which itself is connected to an oxygen atom (likely part of a carbonyl group). This structure suggests the molecule could be involved in interactions with enzymes that metabolize such compounds, like CYP enzymes (Cytochrome P450 family).
Step 2: The molecule also includes multiple aromatic rings, particularly around the central structure and at the ends, suggesting it may interact with proteins that bind to or modify aromatic residues, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels.
Step 3: The presence of negatively charged oxygen atoms (-O-) indicates the molecule might act as a ligand for ion channels or receptors that respond to changes in ion concentration, like the Cav1.2 calcium channel encoded by CACNA1H.
Step 4: Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, this molecule could potentially interact with several enzymes and receptors involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways, such as those encoded by HTR (serotonin receptors), DRD (dopamine receptors), and CHRM (muscarinic acetylcholine receptors).
Step 5: Considering the detailed molecular structure and potential interactions, the related genes are likely to include: CACNA1H, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4.
