Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(-c2cc(C3CCN(c4ccc(C(C)=O)cc4[N+](=O)[O-])CC3)[n-]n2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with a quinoline moiety attached to it. This structural feature is common in many drugs that interact with various receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a quinoline group often indicates potential interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs including those that modulate neurotransmitter systems.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule includes a nitrile group (-CN), which is known to interact with certain ion channels and may have effects on G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 4: Given the complex structure involving multiple functional groups and potential binding sites, this molecule could interact with several genes related to drug metabolism and receptor modulation, such as CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are all involved in the metabolism of drugs.
Step 5: The molecule also has a pyrrolidine ring and a carboxamide group, which might suggest potential interactions with genes encoding for GPCRs like HTR2A and HTR2B, as well as other neurotransmitter receptors.
Related gene names:
- CYP2D6
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP3A4
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
These genes are likely to be influenced by the molecule due to its diverse functional groups and potential for interaction with both metabolic enzymes and receptors.
