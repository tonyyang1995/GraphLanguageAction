Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCC[NH+](CCCC)CCC(O)c1cc2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2c2cc(C(F)(F)F)ccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a quaternary ammonium group (NH+) attached to a large hydrophobic core consisting of multiple benzene rings and alkyl chains. This structure suggests potential interactions with membrane proteins or transporters that have similar hydrophobic regions.
Step 2: The presence of fluorine atoms (-F) in the molecule indicates possible recognition by proteins involved in receptor-ligand binding, particularly those with fluoride-binding domains.
Step 3: The molecule's overall size and shape could fit into the active site of enzymes or receptors that have similar dimensions, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 4: Given the potential for the molecule to interact with membrane proteins or receptors, it may be relevant to genes encoding GPCRs like HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HRH1, which are known to modulate neurotransmitter signaling.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule might interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are encoded by the corresponding genes.
