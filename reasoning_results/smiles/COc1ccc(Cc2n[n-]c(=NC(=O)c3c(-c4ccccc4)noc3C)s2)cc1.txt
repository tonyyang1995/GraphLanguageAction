Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(Cc2n[n-]c(=NC(=O)c3c(-c4ccccc4)noc3C)s2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex molecule that includes a quinoline ring system, a pyridine ring, and several substituents such as phenyl groups, a cyano group, and a nitrile group. This molecular structure suggests the potential for interactions with various receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) and a nitrile group (-C#N) in the molecule could indicate potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize drugs containing these functional groups.
Step 3: The quinoline ring system is common in molecules that interact with adrenergic receptors (such as α and β receptors). Therefore, the molecule might have an affinity for adrenergic receptor genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, and CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4.
Step 4: The presence of a nitrile group and other functional groups could also suggest interaction with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are known to be involved in serotonin signaling pathways.
Step 5: Given the complexity and functional groups present in the molecule, it may also interact with genes involved in the arachidonic acid metabolism pathway, such as PTGS1, which codes for cyclooxygenase-1, a key enzyme in this pathway.
