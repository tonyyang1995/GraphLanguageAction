Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Clc1cccc(-c2nnnn2Cc2cccnc2)c1Cl, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a chlorinated benzene derivative with a complex ring structure, including a phenyl group attached to a pyrrole ring via a double bond, and further substituted with a nitro group, a chlorine atom, and a benzene ring with an amine group.
Step 2: This structure does not directly suggest a strong relationship with any single gene. However, the presence of aromatic rings, nitrogen-containing heterocycles, and functional groups like the nitro group can be indicative of potential interactions with certain drug targets that are involved in signaling pathways or have binding sites for small molecules.
Step 3: Among the listed genes, those involved in neurotransmitter systems or drug metabolism might have a higher likelihood of interaction due to the presence of nitrogen and aromatic structures in the molecule. Genes such as HTR1A (serotonin receptor), HTR2A (serotonin receptor), CYP2C19 (cytochrome P450 enzyme), and CYP2D6 (cytochrome P450 enzyme) could potentially interact with this molecule.
Step 4: The molecule's structure, particularly the presence of aromatic rings and nitrogen-containing heterocycles, suggests possible interactions with genes encoding receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmission or drug metabolism. These include HTR1A, HTR2A, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 5: Summary of related genes: HTR1A, HTR2A, CYP2C19, CYP2D6.
Summary of related gene names:
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6 Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a chlorinated benzene derivative with a complex ring structure, including a phenyl group attached to a pyrrole ring via a double bond, and further substituted with a nitro group, a chlorine atom, and a benzene ring with an amine group.
Step 2: This structure does not directly suggest a strong relationship with any single gene but indicates potential interactions with drug targets that are involved in signaling pathways or have binding sites for small molecules.
Step 3: Among the listed genes, those involved in neurotransmitter systems or drug metabolism might have a higher likelihood of interaction due to the presence of nitrogen and aromatic structures in the molecule. Genes such as HTR1A, HTR2A, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 could potentially interact with this molecule.
- CYP2D6
