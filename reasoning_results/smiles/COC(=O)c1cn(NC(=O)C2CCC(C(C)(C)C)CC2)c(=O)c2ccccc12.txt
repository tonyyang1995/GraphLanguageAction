Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COC(=O)c1cn(NC(=O)C2CCC(C(C)(C)C)CC2)c(=O)c2ccccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound that includes a benzene ring, an amide group, and a pyrrole ring. These structural features are characteristic of many drugs and small molecules that interact with receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The benzene ring and amide group suggest that this molecule could potentially interact with proteins such as receptors and enzymes. Benzene rings are common in drugs that bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), while amides are often found in ligands for enzymes like CYP enzymes.
Step 3: The presence of a pyrrole ring indicates that the molecule might be able to form hydrogen bonds or other interactions with amino acid residues in protein binding sites, which could affect the function of various proteins including receptors and enzymes.
Step 4: Given the structural features of the molecule, it is likely to interact with genes encoding enzymes involved in drug metabolism (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and receptors (e.g., ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HRH1, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4). These interactions could modulate the expression or activity of these genes.
Step 5: The molecule may also interact with genes encoding ion channels (e.g., KCNH2, CACNA1H) due to its aromatic and heterocyclic nature, which can influence the permeability and function of these channels.
