Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [NH3+]CCCCCC(=O)[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is an amine compound with a positive charge and a carboxylate group. This structure suggests it could interact with proteins that have binding sites for basic amino groups or acidic carboxylic acids.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring (indicated by "C(=O)") and a long alkane chain suggests this molecule could potentially interact with enzymes involved in metabolism or signaling pathways, which might be encoded by genes like CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, known for their role in drug metabolism.
Step 3: Given the presence of a carboxylate group, the molecule may also interact with ion channels or receptors that have a preference for negatively charged molecules, such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are serotonin receptors.
Step 4: The long alkane chain could also suggest potential interactions with membrane-bound proteins or receptors, such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are dopamine receptors, or LCK, which is involved in signal transduction.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure, the molecule may not directly relate to all listed genes but could interact with several neurotransmitter-related genes due to its potential to bind to various receptors and ion channels.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- DRD2
- DRD3
- DRD4
- LCK
These genes are involved in various biological processes including metabolism and neurotransmission, which aligns with the molecule's chemical structure.
