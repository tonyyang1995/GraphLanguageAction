Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc2ccc(=O)oc2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string COc1ccc2ccc(=O)oc2c1 corresponds to a chemical compound named 4-((4-(1H-indol-3-yl)-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)methyl)-N-methylbenzamide. This compound contains an indole ring fused to a pyrrole ring, which is connected to a benzene ring via a methyl group and an amide bond.
Step 2: The structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes and receptors involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways due to its aromatic nature and presence of functional groups like amides and methyl groups. These features are often recognized by specific proteins that regulate signaling pathways.
Step 3: The molecule's structure is likely to interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP family), particularly CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, as it contains a heteroaromatic system and a methylated amide group, which are known substrates for these enzymes. This interaction could affect drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics.
Step 4: Given the presence of an amine group (-NH2) and an aromatic system, this molecule may also interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as HTR2A (serotonin 5-HT2A receptor), which is involved in various neurological functions including mood regulation and cognition.
Step 5: The molecule's structure might not directly relate to other genes listed, such as those encoding for kinases (e.g., LCK, KDR), transcription factors (e.g., MCL1, PPARG), or membrane transporters (e.g., SLC6A2, SLC6A4). However, it could potentially influence downstream targets of these proteins through modulating their activity or altering their expression levels indirectly.
Summary of Related Genes: CYP2D6, CYP2C19, HTR2A
Note: The summary focuses on the genes most likely to be influenced by the molecule based on its structural features. Other genes listed do not have a direct or clear relationship with the given molecule's structure. Step 5: The summary highlights the key genes that the molecule is most likely to interact with based on its chemical structure and potential biological activities. The final list includes CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and HTR2A.
