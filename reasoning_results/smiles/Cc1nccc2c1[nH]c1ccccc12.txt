Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1nccc2c1[nH]c1ccccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string (Cc1nccc2c1[nH]c1ccccc12) represents a molecule that contains a heterocyclic aromatic ring system with a nitrogen atom, which is likely to be an amine or a similar functional group. This type of structure is often associated with molecules that can interact with receptors or enzymes, particularly those involved in neurotransmission and metabolism.
Step 2: Analyzing the structure further, the presence of a nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring suggests potential interaction with ion channels or receptors that contain such groups. For example, the molecule could potentially interact with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which have a similar nitrogen-containing structure in their ligand-binding sites.
Step 3: Given the potential for interaction with nAChRs, we can look at genes that are known to encode proteins involved in this receptor system. Relevant genes include CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4, which encode muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Additionally, HTR2A and HTR2C, which encode serotonin receptors, might also be relevant due to their role in neurotransmission and the potential for cross-talk with acetylcholine systems.
Step 4: Considering the molecule's possible involvement in metabolic pathways, genes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of various drugs and xenobiotics, could also be relevant. However, without more detailed information about the molecule's pharmacological profile, it is speculative whether it directly interacts with these enzymes.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the following genes are potentially relevant based on the molecule's structure and its possible interactions: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR2A, HTR2C, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These genes are involved in neurotransmission, particularly cholinergic and serotonergic systems, and drug metabolism.
