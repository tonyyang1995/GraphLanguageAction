Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)[NH2+]CC(O)c1ccccc1Cl, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is common in many drug molecules that interact with receptors and enzymes. This structural feature suggests potential interactions with genes encoding receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of an amine group (-NH2) indicates the molecule could be a ligand for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly those involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways. This aligns with genes such as DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode dopamine and serotonin receptors.
Step 3: The carboxylic acid group (O=C-OH) in the molecule might allow it to interact with ion channels or enzymes involved in metabolism. This could relate to genes like KCNH2, which encodes a potassium channel, and CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: The presence of a chlorine atom (-Cl) could affect the molecule’s lipophilicity and reactivity, potentially influencing its binding to proteins and enzymes. This could be relevant to genes involved in drug transport, such as ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein), which is known to pump out certain drugs from cells.
Step 5: The overall structure, including the benzene rings and functional groups, suggests the molecule could interact with multiple targets, possibly affecting various signaling pathways and metabolic processes. Genes such as CYP3A4, PTGS1, and SLC6A4 could be relevant due to their roles in drug metabolism and transport.
