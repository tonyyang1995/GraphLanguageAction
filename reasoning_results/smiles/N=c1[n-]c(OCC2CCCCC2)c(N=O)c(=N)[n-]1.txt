Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N=c1[n-]c(OCC2CCCCC2)c(N=O)c(=N)[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that contains a nitroso group (-N=N-) and several aromatic rings, including a pyrrole ring and a benzene ring. This structural feature suggests that the molecule could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways or transport processes.
Step 2: Analyzing the genes provided, those involved in neurotransmitter transport and receptor function, such as SLC6A2 (serotonin transporter), SLC6A4 (norepinephrine transporter), HTR2A (serotonin 5-HT2A receptor), HTR2B (serotonin 5-HT2B receptor), HTR2C (serotonin 5-HT2C receptor), and CHRM1 (muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1) are relevant due to their role in neurotransmission.
Step 3: Considering the presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocycle and potential for forming hydrogen bonds, the molecule might be related to genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like CHRM3 (muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3) and CHRM4 (muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M4).
Step 4: Given the presence of an amide group (-CO-NH-) and the overall molecular complexity, the molecule may also have affinity for enzymes such as CYP2D6 (cytochrome P450 2D6), which is involved in drug metabolism, and PTGS1 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1), which plays a role in inflammation and pain.
Step 5: Based on the analysis, the related genes include: SLC6A2, SLC6A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2D6, and PTGS1.
