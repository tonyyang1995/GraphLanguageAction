Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(=O)NCCc1c[nH]c2ccc([O-])cc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a structure that includes a carboxamide (CON), an amide (C(=O)N), and a substituted benzene ring with a nitrogen atom and an oxygen-containing substituent. This pattern suggests potential interactions with enzymes or receptors involved in metabolism, neurotransmission, or inflammation.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom and a substituent containing oxygen indicates possible interactions with enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of various drugs and xenobiotics through oxidation reactions. These enzymes play a crucial role in drug metabolism, making them relevant to the molecule's potential pharmacological activity.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a benzene ring with a substituted nitrogen atom, which could interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Among the listed genes, GPCRs are represented by CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These receptors are involved in neurotransmission and are known to bind to ligands with similar structures to the given molecule.
Step 4: The presence of a carboxamide group suggests potential interactions with ion channels, particularly those involved in calcium signaling. The gene CACNA1H encodes for a voltage-gated calcium channel, which may be influenced by the molecule due to its structural similarity to compounds that modulate calcium channels.
Step 5: The overall structure of the molecule does not strongly suggest direct interactions with the remaining genes listed, such as ABCB1, ABL1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CA12, CA2, CA9, CDK2, CNR1, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, ESR1, FLT1, HRH1, KDR, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, PPARG, PTGS1, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4. However, it may indirectly affect their expression or function through its interactions with other proteins or enzymes.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CACNA1H. These genes are primarily involved in metabolism, neurotransmission, and calcium signaling. The molecule's structure suggests it may interact with enzymes and receptors associated with these processes.
