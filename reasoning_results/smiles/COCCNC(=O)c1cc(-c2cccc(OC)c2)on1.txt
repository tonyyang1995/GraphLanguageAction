Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COCCNC(=O)c1cc(-c2cccc(OC)c2)on1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a molecule that contains a benzene ring (Phenyl group) attached to a carboxylic acid (-COOH), an amide group (-CONH-), and a pyrrolidine ring. The presence of a carboxylic acid and amide suggests the molecule could be a small organic drug-like compound. This structure is common in molecules that interact with receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The molecule’s structure indicates potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to its amine group and the pyrrolidine ring which are characteristic of ligands for these receptors. GPCRs are often involved in signaling pathways mediated by neurotransmitters and hormones, and they are targeted by many drugs.
Step 3: Considering the pharmacological profile, the molecule might interact with genes encoding for various receptors and enzymes. For instance, the amine group could potentially interact with adrenergic receptors (e.g., ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (e.g., CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 4: Additionally, the carboxylic acid and amide functionality could also interact with genes encoding for enzymes such as CYP2C9 and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize many drugs. These enzymes play crucial roles in the biotransformation of xenobiotics and endogenous substances.
Step 5: Given the potential for the molecule to interact with both receptors and enzymes, the related gene names are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2D6. 
Summary of Related Gene Names:
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- ADRB2
- CHRM1
- CHRM3
- CHRM4
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
Note: The molecule does not have direct interactions with other specified genes like ABCB1, EGFR, or PTGS1 based on the provided structural information. However, it could potentially influence their expression or function through indirect mechanisms such as altering the activity of enzymes that regulate their expression or metabolism.
