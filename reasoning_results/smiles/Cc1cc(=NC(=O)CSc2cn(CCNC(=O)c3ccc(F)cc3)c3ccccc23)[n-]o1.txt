Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc(=NC(=O)CSc2cn(CCNC(=O)c3ccc(F)cc3)c3ccccc23)[n-]o1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other type of explanation.
Step 1: The molecule contains a tricyclic structure with a central pyrrole ring fused to a benzene ring and an indole ring. This pattern suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) and amide groups (C=O) indicates possible binding to receptors that have similar functional groups, such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B) and dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3).
Step 3: The aromatic nature and overall shape of the molecule could facilitate interaction with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly those involved in neurotransmission (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HRH1).
Step 4: The molecule's potential for metabolic interactions through its functional groups might also affect genes involved in the regulation of drug metabolism pathways (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and functional groups, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
