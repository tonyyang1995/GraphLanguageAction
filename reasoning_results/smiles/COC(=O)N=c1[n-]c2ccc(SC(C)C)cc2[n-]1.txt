Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COC(=O)N=c1[n-]c2ccc(SC(C)C)cc2[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a molecule that includes an amide group (C(=O)N), a cyano group (C#N), and several aromatic rings. The presence of a cyano group suggests potential electrophilic reactivity and the ability to form covalent bonds with proteins, which could interact with enzymes or receptors.
Step 2: The aromatic rings in the molecule, particularly those containing sulfur (SC(C)C), suggest potential for interactions with enzymes involved in phase I metabolism such as cytochrome P450s (CYP). CYP enzymes are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics, making them relevant targets for this type of molecule.
Step 3: Given the presence of a cyano group and potential for metabolic activation, this molecule might interact with enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are all involved in the metabolism of numerous drugs and are listed among the given genes.
Step 4: The amide and aromatic structures in the molecule also suggest potential for interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are often targets for drugs. This could relate to the genes ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode for various subtypes of adrenergic and serotonin receptors.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and the potential for both metabolic activation and receptor interactions, the most likely related genes from the provided list include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Summary of related genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
