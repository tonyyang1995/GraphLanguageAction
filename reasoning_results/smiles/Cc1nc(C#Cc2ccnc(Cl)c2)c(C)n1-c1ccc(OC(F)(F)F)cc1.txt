Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1nc(C#Cc2ccnc(Cl)c2)c(C)n1-c1ccc(OC(F)(F)F)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a nitrogen atom attached, forming a heterocyclic structure. This pattern is commonly found in ligands that interact with receptors such as adrenergic and cholinergic receptors.
Step 2: The molecule also includes fluorine atoms attached to the benzene ring, which are known to enhance the binding affinity of molecules to certain receptors, particularly those involved in neurotransmission.
Step 3: The presence of a pyrrolidine ring (a five-membered heterocycle containing a nitrogen atom) suggests potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are known to have similar structural motifs.
Step 4: The molecule's overall structure, including its substituents and functional groups, aligns with the binding preferences of enzymes like CYP2D6 and CYP2C9, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs and other small molecules.
Step 5: Based on the structural features identified, the molecule may be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2D6, and CYP2C9. Step 5: Related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2D6, CYP2C9.
