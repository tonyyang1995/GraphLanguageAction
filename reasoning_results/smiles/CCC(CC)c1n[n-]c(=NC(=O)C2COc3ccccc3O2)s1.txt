Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCC(CC)c1n[n-]c(=NC(=O)C2COc3ccccc3O2)s1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a benzene ring with substituents such as a nitro group (-NO2), an amide group (N-C(=O)-O), and a pyridine ring with a sulfonyl group (-SO2). This complex structure suggests the molecule may have pharmacological activity due to its potential interactions with various receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: Considering the presence of a nitro group and an amide, this molecule could interact with enzymes involved in metabolism or signaling pathways, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. These cytochrome P450 enzymes are known to metabolize drugs and other xenobiotics, which might be influenced by the molecule's structure.
Step 3: The amide group and overall structure of the molecule also suggest it could bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are often targets for drugs affecting neurotransmission and hormone signaling. Specifically, HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A) and DRD2 (dopamine receptor 2) could be relevant, given their involvement in neurotransmitter systems.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a benzene ring and substituents like the nitro group could indicate potential interaction with ion channels, such as KCNH2 (hERG potassium channel), which might be relevant for cardiac safety assessments.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the molecule could be related to CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, and DRD2 based on the structural features and pharmacological implications of the molecule.
