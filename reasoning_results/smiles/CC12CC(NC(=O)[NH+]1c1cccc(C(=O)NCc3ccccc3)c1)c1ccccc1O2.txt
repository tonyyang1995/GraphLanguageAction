Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC12CC(NC(=O)[NH+]1c1cccc(C(=O)NCc3ccccc3)c1)c1ccccc1O2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure containing multiple functional groups including an amide group (-CONH), a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and an ester group (-OCO-). These functional groups are often involved in binding to proteins and other biomolecules, which may indicate potential interactions with various genes.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and a pyrrolidine ring in the molecule suggests that it could interact with receptors or enzymes that contain aromatic residues or have specific binding pockets for such structures. This pattern is relevant to several genes involved in neurotransmitter signaling, such as DRD2 (Dopamine Receptor D2), HTR2A (Serotonin Receptor 2A), and CHRM1 (Cholinergic Receptor Muscarinic M1).
Step 3: The presence of an acetyl group (-COCH3) and a hydroxyl group (-OH) indicates that the molecule might be able to modulate enzymes or receptors that are sensitive to acetylation or phosphorylation, which is characteristic of some genes like PTGS1 (Cyclooxygenase 1) and KCNH2 (Potassium Voltage-Gated Channel Subfamily H Member 2).
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule, particularly the amide and ester groups, hints at its potential to act as a ligand or inhibitor for enzymes such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in drug metabolism. This is relevant to genes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19.
Step 5: Considering the detailed structure and functional groups of the molecule, it appears to have the potential to interact with several neurotransmitter receptors and enzymes, making it potentially relevant to genes involved in signal transduction pathways and drug metabolism. The related genes include: DRD2, HTR2A, CHRM1, PTGS1, KCNH2, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. 
Summary of Related Genes: DRD2, HTR2A, CHRM1, PTGS1, KCNH2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19.
