Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N=c1[n-]c(-c2ccccc2)c(-c2ccccc2)s1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule in question is a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compound with a nitrile group (-CN) and a sulfide (-S) group. It also contains aromatic rings (cyclohexane-like structures), which are common in many bioactive molecules due to their planar nature and ability to stabilize the molecule through delocalized π electrons.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrile group (-CN) and a sulfide (-S) suggests potential electrophilic reactivity and the ability to form covalent bonds with proteins. These functional groups are often involved in drug-protein interactions, including those that modulate receptor activity or inhibit enzymes.
Step 3: Looking at the genes provided, several are known to be involved in the metabolism of drugs or the response to drugs, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. These cytochrome P450 enzymes play a crucial role in the biotransformation of xenobiotics, including drugs, and are directly related to the metabolism of the molecule described.
Step 4: Additionally, some genes listed are associated with neurotransmitter systems and receptors, like HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, and CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4. These genes encode for various receptors and enzymes that could interact with the molecule, affecting its pharmacological profile and potential therapeutic effects.
Step 5: Given the structural features of the molecule, it is likely to interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism (CYP enzymes) and receptors involved in neurotransmission (HTR and DRD series, cholinergic receptors). Therefore, the related genes include:
- Metabolism-related: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4
- Neurotransmission-related: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4
Summary of Related Genes:
- CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4
- CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4
These genes are relevant because they either metabolize the molecule or are targets for its pharmacological effects. Other genes may not have a direct interaction but are included in this list based on their involvement in similar pathways or functions.
