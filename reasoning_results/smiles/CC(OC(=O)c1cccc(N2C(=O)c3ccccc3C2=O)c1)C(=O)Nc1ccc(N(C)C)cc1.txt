Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(OC(=O)c1cccc(N2C(=O)c3ccccc3C2=O)c1)C(=O)Nc1ccc(N(C)C)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups including an amide, a carboxylic acid, and a benzene ring. It also contains a pyrrolidine ring and a couple of aromatic rings. This complexity suggests that the molecule may interact with proteins involved in various biological processes such as signal transduction, neurotransmission, and metabolism.
Step 2: Looking at the specific chemical structure, we see that there are several potential points of interaction with receptors and enzymes. For instance, the presence of a carboxylic acid group could make it an inhibitor or substrate for enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize many drugs and endogenous substances.
Step 3: The molecule's structure also includes a benzene ring, which is common in ligands that bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Therefore, it might interact with receptors such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, all of which have benzene ring-containing ligands.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule could indicate its potential to act as a ligand for ion channels or receptors, possibly interacting with KCNH2 and SIGMAR1, both of which have nitrogen-containing ligands.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule could be related to the following genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, and SIGMAR1. These genes encode proteins that are involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmission, and ion channel function, which aligns with the molecular structure and potential binding sites identified in the molecule. 
Summary of related genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, SIGMAR1.
