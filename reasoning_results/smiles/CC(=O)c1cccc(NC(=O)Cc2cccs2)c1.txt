Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(=O)c1cccc(NC(=O)Cc2cccs2)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that includes a benzene ring system (CC), an amide group (C(=O)), and a tricyclic core with a nitrogen atom in the ring (c1cccc). This structure suggests the molecule may have pharmacological activity due to its potential to interact with various receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (C(=O)) indicates the molecule could be a ligand for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are known to have amino acid sequences that include amides. This feature could make the molecule relevant to genes encoding GPCRs such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 3: The tricyclic structure with a nitrogen atom in the ring (c1cccc(N)) might suggest the molecule has potential to interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs), which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs and xenobiotics. This could make the molecule relevant to genes encoding CYP enzymes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
Step 4: The benzene ring (CC) in the molecule could also indicate potential interactions with other drug targets such as kinases. This could make the molecule relevant to genes encoding kinases like LCK and MCL1.
Step 5: Based on the structural features of the molecule, it appears to be most closely related to the genes encoding GPCRs (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) and cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6).
Summary of related gene names:
- GPCRs: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- Cytochrome P450 enzymes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule with a benzene ring, an amide group, and a tricyclic core containing a nitrogen atom. These structural features suggest the molecule may have pharmacological activity.
Step 2: The amide group in the molecule indicates potential interaction with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which often contain amide functionalities. This makes the molecule potentially relevant to genes encoding GPCRs such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 3: The tricyclic structure with a nitrogen atom could indicate potential interactions with
