Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)C12C[NH+]3CC(C(C)C)(C[NH+](C1)C3c1cccnc1)C2=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with multiple functional groups including a benzene ring, amine group, and an imidazole ring. The presence of these groups suggests the molecule could have interactions with proteins that bind to aromatic rings or have specific amino acid side chains.
Step 2: Analyzing the pattern of the molecule, it includes an amide group (-CONH-) which is common in ligands for receptors and enzymes. This functional group can form hydrogen bonds, which are crucial for protein-ligand interactions. 
Step 3: The molecule also contains an aldehyde group (-COOH), which is often involved in conjugation reactions and can interact with proteins through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions.
Step 4: Given the presence of the amine and imidazole groups, this molecule might interact with ion channels or receptors that contain similar functional groups in their binding sites. For instance, it could potentially interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to the presence of the amine group.
Step 5: Considering the possible interactions based on the molecular structure, the most likely related genes are those encoding for GPCRs, enzymes involved in drug metabolism, and ion channels. Therefore, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, LCK, OPNK1, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, LCK, OPRK1, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
