Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+]1CN(c2ccccc2)C2(CC[NH+](CCCC(=O)c3ccc(F)cc3)CC2)C1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex molecule that includes a nitrogen atom with a positive charge, a benzene ring, and a pyrrolidine ring. This structure suggests the molecule may interact with proteins that have similar functional groups or binding sites.
Step 2: Analyzing the gene list provided, several genes are related to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), enzymes involved in drug metabolism, and neurotransmitter receptors. These include ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and CYP2D6. The presence of a positively charged nitrogen and aromatic rings in the molecule could potentially interact with these receptors.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule's structure might be relevant to CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are also involved in drug metabolism. The presence of a carbonyl group and alkyl chains in the molecule could indicate its potential role in these enzymes' activity.
Step 4: The molecule's structure does not appear to have a direct relationship with other genes such as ABCB1, ABL1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, CA12, CA2, CA9, CACNA1H, CDK2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CNR1, EGFR, ESR1, FLT1, HRH1, KDR, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, PPARG, PTGS1, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2, or SLC6A4 based on their known functions and lack of corresponding chemical features in the molecule.
Step 5: Based on the analysis, the related genes are: ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. These genes are involved in receptor function and drug metabolism, which aligns with the molecule's structural characteristics.
