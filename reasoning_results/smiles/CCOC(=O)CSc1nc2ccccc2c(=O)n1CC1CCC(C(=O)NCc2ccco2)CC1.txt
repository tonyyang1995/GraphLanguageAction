Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)CSc1nc2ccccc2c(=O)n1CC1CCC(C(=O)NCc2ccco2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule provided has a complex structure that includes several functional groups such as amide (N=C), ester (O=C), and aromatic rings. It also contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). These structural elements are indicative of small molecule ligands that often interact with receptors or enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of multiple benzene rings suggests the molecule could be an agonist or antagonist for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) which are known to have a seven-transmembrane domain structure and typically bind to ligands that fit into their extracellular loops or transmembrane regions.
Step 3: Considering the molecule's potential to interact with GPCRs, we can infer that it might be related to several genes encoding GPCRs such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes encode for different subtypes of adrenergic and serotonin receptors, all of which are involved in various physiological processes including neurotransmission and hormone signaling.
Step 4: The molecule's ability to potentially modulate these receptors indicates it may influence downstream signaling pathways involving these receptors. For example, activation of adrenergic receptors (encoded by ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) can lead to changes in heart rate and blood pressure, while activation of serotonin receptors (encoded by HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) can affect mood and anxiety.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6. These genes are involved in the modulation of neurotransmitter systems and could be targets for the molecule due to its potential to act as a ligand for GPCRs. 
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
