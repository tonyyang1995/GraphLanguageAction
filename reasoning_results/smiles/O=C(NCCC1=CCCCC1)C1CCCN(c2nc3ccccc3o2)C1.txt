Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(NCCC1=CCCCC1)C1CCCN(c2nc3ccccc3o2)C1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that includes a benzene ring, a pyrrole ring, and multiple substituents such as methyl groups and hydroxyl groups. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, particularly those related to neurotransmission and receptor binding.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and hydroxyl groups could indicate a compound with affinity for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are often targeted by drugs due to their role in various physiological processes including neurotransmission. This aligns with several genes listed, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, all of which encode for different subtypes of GPCRs.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a cyano group (-CN) and a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) could suggest the molecule has potential to interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, which are key in metabolizing many pharmaceuticals.
Step 4: The overall structure also hints at possible anti-inflammatory activity due to the presence of multiple aromatic rings and hydroxyl groups, which are common in non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This is supported by the presence of the gene PTGS1, which encodes for cyclooxygenase-1, an enzyme involved in prostaglandin synthesis.
Step 5: Given the complexity and specific functional groups present, the molecule could have a broad range of pharmacological effects, but based on the provided gene list, it seems most likely to be related to genes encoding GPCRs and enzymes involved in drug metabolism and inflammation.
Summary of related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, PTGS1.
