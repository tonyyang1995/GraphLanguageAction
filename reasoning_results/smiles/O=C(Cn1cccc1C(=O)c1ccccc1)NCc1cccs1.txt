Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Cn1cccc1C(=O)c1ccccc1)NCc1cccs1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule, represented by the SMILES string O=C(Cn1cccc1C(=O)c1ccccc1)NCc1cccs1, contains a benzene ring system with a nitrile group (-CN) attached to it. This structure suggests the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors that interact with similar functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of the nitrile group (-CN) and the overall structure hint at potential interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP), which are known to metabolize compounds containing nitriles. Specifically, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are known to metabolize such compounds.
Step 3: Additionally, the benzene ring and amide linkage suggest potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs like HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 are known to bind to molecules with similar aromatic and amide structures, which could influence their activity.
Step 4: Given the nitrile and amide functionalities, there's also a possibility of interaction with enzymes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism, such as PTGS1 (COX-1/COX-2), which might be influenced by molecules with similar functional groups.
Step 5: Based on the structural features of the molecule, the related genes include those involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6) and GPCR signaling pathways (HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
