Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [NH2+]=C1Nc2ccccc2Oc2ccccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a substituted naphthylamine, featuring an amine group (NH2+) attached to a naphthalene ring, and a nitro group (NO2) and an alcohol group (-OH) attached to another ring. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a nitro group could indicate the molecule is metabolized via the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, specifically CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize drugs containing aromatic rings and nitro groups.
Step 3: Given the amine group and the overall structure, the molecule might also interact with receptors that have amine binding sites, such as DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), DRD3 (dopamine receptor D3), and DRD4 (dopamine receptor D4).
Step 4: The presence of an alcohol group could suggest the molecule may interact with enzymes involved in alcohol metabolism, such as ADH1 (alcohol dehydrogenase 1) and ALDH2 (aldehyde dehydrogenase 2), though they are not listed in the provided gene list.
Step 5: Considering the interaction with the cytochrome P450 enzymes and dopamine receptors, the related genes include CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
