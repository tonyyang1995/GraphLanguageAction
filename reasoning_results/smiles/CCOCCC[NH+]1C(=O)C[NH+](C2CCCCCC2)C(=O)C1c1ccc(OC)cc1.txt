Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOCCC[NH+]1C(=O)C[NH+](C2CCCCCC2)C(=O)C1c1ccc(OC)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound with multiple functional groups, including an amide, ester, and aromatic rings. Notably, it contains several nitrogen-containing functional groups, such as amine and amide, which are common in ligands for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 2: Among the provided genes, several are known to be involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter systems and signal transduction pathways, which often interact with small molecules through GPCRs. For instance, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 encode for different subtypes of serotonin receptors, while CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4 encode for muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of aromatic rings and amide groups suggests that the molecule could potentially interact with ion channels or enzymes. For example, KCNH2 encodes for a voltage-gated potassium channel, and CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are members of the cytochrome P450 family, which metabolizes many drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 4: Furthermore, the molecule’s structure might also influence its interactions with other genes involved in signaling pathways, such as PTGS1 (encoding cyclooxygenase-1), which is involved in prostaglandin synthesis, and SLC6A2 and SLC6A4, which are transporters that facilitate the uptake of neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis and the known functions of the provided genes, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes involved in neurotransmission, signaling, and drug metabolism, including:
- DRD2
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4
- KCNH2
- CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6
- PTGS1
- SLC6A2, SLC6A4
These genes play crucial roles in various biological processes, and their interaction with the molecule could have significant physiological implications. However, without experimental data, this is a speculative conclusion based on the molecular structure and known gene functions. Related Gene List: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, KCNH2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
