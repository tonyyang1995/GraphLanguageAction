Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1cc(-c2ccc([O-])c(-c3c([O-])cc([O-])c4c(=O)cc(-c5ccc([O-])cc5)oc34)c2)oc2cc([O-])cc([O-])c12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure that includes several functional groups such as carbonyl (C=O), amide (C(-N)), ester (C-O-C), and aromatic rings. The presence of these functional groups suggests potential interactions with enzymes and receptors involved in various biological processes.
Step 2: Notably, the molecule contains an ester group (C-O-C) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) linked to an aromatic ring, which could be recognized by enzymes like CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, known for their ability to metabolize compounds containing these functional groups. These enzymes are responsible for drug metabolism and may interact with the molecule through these specific chemical features.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups, such as hydroxyl (-OH) and carboxyl (-COOH), indicates that the molecule might also interact with receptors or ion channels that are sensitive to such moieties. For example, CACNA1H, which encodes a voltage-gated calcium channel, could potentially interact with the molecule due to its sensitivity to ligands containing polar head groups.
Step 4: Furthermore, the overall structure of the molecule suggests possible interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Specifically, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which encode serotonin receptors, might interact with this molecule if it possesses the appropriate pharmacophoric features to bind to these receptors. Serotonin receptors play crucial roles in neurotransmission and are often targets for drugs affecting mood and behavior.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis and the potential interactions described above, the related genes to this molecule are: CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CACNA1H, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C.
