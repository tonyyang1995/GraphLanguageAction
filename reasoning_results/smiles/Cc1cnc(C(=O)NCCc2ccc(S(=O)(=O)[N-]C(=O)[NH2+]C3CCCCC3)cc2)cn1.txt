Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and a sulfonamide moiety. This structure is often found in ligands that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly those involved in neurotransmission.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and a carboxylic acid group suggests potential interactions with genes encoding GPCRs such as DRD2, HTR1A, and HTR2A, which are known to have binding sites for ligands with similar chemical features.
Step 3: The sulfonamide moiety may also contribute to interactions with genes encoding enzymes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs containing similar functional groups.
Step 4: The overall structure indicates possible interactions with genes involved in neurotransmitter systems, including DRD2, HTR2A, and HTR2B.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes are: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, CYP2C9, CYP2C19.
