Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCc1c(OCCCOc2ccc(OCC(=O)[O-])cc2)ccc(CC=O)c1[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with multiple substituents, including an ester group and an amine group. This structural feature suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an ester group (-OCOR) indicates that the molecule could be a substrate for CYP enzymes, particularly CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize drugs containing these functional groups.
Step 3: The molecule also has a quinoline-like structure, which may interact with enzymes such as CYP1A2 and CYP2D6, which have been shown to metabolize compounds with similar aromatic rings.
Step 4: The amine group could potentially interact with receptors such as DRD2 (Dopamine D2 receptor), which is a target for drugs with basic functional groups, and HTR2A (Serotonin 5-HT2A receptor), another receptor that binds basic ligands.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and potential interactions, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, and HTR2A. Step 5: Related Gene List: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A.
