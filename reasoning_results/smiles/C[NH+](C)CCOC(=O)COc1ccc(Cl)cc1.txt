Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring with an amine group and a positively charged nitrogen, suggesting potential interaction with receptors that bind small molecules, such as neurotransmitters or hormones.
Step 2: The presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group and an ester linkage indicates possible activity as a prodrug or inhibitor of enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP enzymes.
Step 3: The molecule also has a benzene ring and a carboxylic acid group, which could interact with ion channels or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 4: Considering the pharmacological potential of the molecule, it may interact with genes encoding for receptors and transporters involved in neurotransmission and hormone signaling, such as adrenergic and cholinergic receptors.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule might influence genes involved in inflammation and pain pathways due to its structural features.
