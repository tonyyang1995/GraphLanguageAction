Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCn1c(CCNC(=O)c2ccccc2Cl)n[n-]c1=S, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples or extra context.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom that forms part of a heterocyclic ring (indicated by "n" in the SMILES string), which is attached to a benzene ring (indicated by "CC"). This structural feature suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH-) and a sulfone group (-S=O-) in the molecule indicates it may interact with proteins involved in neurotransmission or signaling pathways. Specifically, these functional groups are characteristic of molecules that could bind to receptors like adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B) and dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3).
Step 3: The molecule's overall structure, including the benzene ring and heterocyclic nitrogen, is reminiscent of ligands that might interact with ion channels. This is relevant to genes encoding for ion channels such as KCNH2 (a member of the potassium channel subfamily H).
Step 4: Given the presence of a halogen atom (chlorine, Cl) and the overall chemical nature of the molecule, it could potentially be metabolized by enzymes like those encoded by CYP1A2, which are known to metabolize xenobiotics.
Step 5: The complex structure and functional groups present in the molecule suggest it might interact with multiple targets, including but not limited to the genes listed above. Therefore, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, KCNH2. Step 5: Related gene names: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, KCNH2.
