Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: c1cncc(-c2nc(=NCc3cccs3)c3ccccc3[n-]2)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that includes a benzene ring, a pyrrole ring, and several nitrogen-containing heterocycles. The presence of multiple nitrogen atoms suggests potential for binding to proteins that interact with amine groups.
Step 2: Analyzing the molecular structure, it contains a tricyclic core (benzene-pyrrole-benzene) which is reminiscent of some drug molecules known to interact with receptors such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are involved in signaling pathways and are targets for many therapeutic agents.
Step 3: Given the presence of a quinoline-like structure (quinoline is a common pharmacophore in drugs targeting receptors like adrenergic and muscarinic receptors), this molecule might have affinity for adrenergic (adrenergic receptors ADRA1D, ADRA2B) and muscarinic (cholinergic receptors CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4) receptors.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure includes a pyrazole ring, which is often found in compounds that act as agonists or antagonists at various receptors including dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) and serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Step 5: Considering the above structural features and their known interactions with receptors, the molecule could be related to several genes encoding receptors such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
