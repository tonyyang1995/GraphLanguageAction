Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+]1CCN(c2nc(C3=C(c4c[nH]c5ccccc45)C(=O)NC3=O)c3ccccc3n2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with an attached positive charge (N+), indicating it is a positively charged amine. This structural feature suggests potential interactions with ion channels and receptors that have binding sites for basic molecules.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxyl group (-COOH) in the molecule indicates it could be an acid or a component of a larger acid-based compound. This could potentially interact with proteins that have acidic residues or are involved in acid-base reactions.
Step 3: The benzene ring system in the molecule is likely to form hydrogen bonds and π-π stacking interactions with other molecules, which may include proteins containing aromatic amino acids such as tryptophan or tyrosine.
Step 4: The presence of multiple hydrophobic regions, particularly from the benzene rings and alkyl chains, suggests the molecule might interact with membrane-bound proteins or transporters, such as those encoded by the ABCB1 gene, which encodes the P-glycoprotein, a transmembrane efflux pump.
Step 5: Given the pattern of functional groups and the overall structure, the molecule could interact with various receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and hormone signaling pathways. This includes genes such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CNR1, and CYP2D6, which encode receptors and enzymes involved in these pathways.
