Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1c2occc2c(OC)c2c(=O)cc(C)oc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound, which includes an aromatic ring (indicated by the 'c' characters), a carbonyl group (-CO-), and several hydroxyl (-OH) groups. The presence of a carbonyl group and hydroxyl groups suggests that this molecule could be involved in covalent binding or hydrogen bonding interactions.
Step 2: Analyzing the structure further, the molecule contains multiple rings and functional groups, indicating it might be a ligand for receptors or enzymes. The aromatic ring system and the presence of hydroxyl groups are common features in molecules that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or other protein targets.
Step 3: Given the presence of a carbonyl group and hydroxyl groups, the molecule could potentially bind to or modulate the activity of enzymes such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are known to metabolize drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 4: Additionally, the hydroxyl groups and aromatic rings in the molecule suggest it may have affinity for ion channels, such as voltage-gated sodium channels (e.g., KCNH2), which could affect their function.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure, the related genes are likely to be those encoding for GPCRs, enzymes involved in drug metabolism, and ion channels. Therefore, the list of related genes includes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, KCNH2, ADRB2, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, LCK, OPRK1, PTGS1, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
