Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC[NH+]1CCCC1CNC(=O)c1cc(S(=O)(=O)CC)c(N)cc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with multiple substituents including a pyrrolidine ring, a thiosemicarbazide group, and a carboxamide group. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes and receptors that have similar chemical moieties.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH2) is indicative of a potential interaction with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those catalyzed by CYP (cytochrome P450) enzymes. CYP enzymes are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics, and the molecule's structure aligns well with substrates for CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule has a thiosemicarbazide moiety, which could interact with proteins containing thiosemicarbazone binding sites. This feature might be relevant to enzymes or receptors like G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly those involved in neurotransmission, such as HTR2A (serotonin receptor) and DRD2 (dopamine receptor).
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule also hints at potential interactions with ion channels and transporters. For example, the presence of a carboxylate group could suggest interactions with ion channels that are sensitive to pH changes, such as KCNH2 (hERG potassium channel). Furthermore, the molecule's size and shape may allow it to interact with transporters like SLC6A2 and SLC6A4, which are involved in the uptake of monoamines.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions with enzymes and receptors, the related genes include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A, DRD2, KCNH2, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4.
