Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)[NH+]1CCN(c2ccc(N=c3nc4c(c[n-]3)cc3n4C4(CCCCC4)CNC3=O)nc2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains multiple aromatic rings and a positively charged nitrogen atom, suggesting it may interact with receptors that have binding sites for small molecules containing aromatic groups and positive charges.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and a pyrrolidine ring indicates potential interaction with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs), which metabolize drugs and xenobiotics, including CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 3: The molecule's structure includes a carboxamide group and a carboxylate group, which could potentially interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, known to bind ligands with similar functional groups.
Step 4: The presence of a benzene ring and a carbonyl group suggests possible interaction with kinases like LCK, which are involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 5: Given the molecular features, the most likely related genes are CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, and LCK.
