Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=[N+]([O-])c1ccc(N2CC[NH2+]CC2)cc1[NH2+]C1CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex molecule that contains several functional groups such as an amide, an amine, and a nitro group. The presence of a nitro group and a positively charged nitrogen atom suggests this molecule could be an electrophilic compound, which might interact with proteins involved in cellular signaling pathways.
Step 2: The molecule also has a benzene ring with multiple substituents, including a phenyl group and a substituted amine. This structural feature indicates potential binding sites for protein receptors, particularly those with ligand-binding domains, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: Given the presence of amine and amide functionalities, the molecule could act as a ligand for receptors like HTR1A (5-HT1A receptor), HTR2A (5-HT2A receptor), and HTR2B (5-HT2B receptor), which are GPCRs that play crucial roles in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways.
Step 4: Considering the molecule’s structure and the genes provided, the most likely related genes are those encoding for GPCRs and enzymes involved in metabolism. Specifically, HTR1A, HTR2A, and HTR2B are directly related due to their ligand-binding properties.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule might interact with enzymes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs and xenobiotics, indicating a potential role in pharmacokinetics.
Summary of related gene names:
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19 Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, we have HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. These genes encode proteins that may interact with the described molecule based on its structural features and functional groups. HTR1A, HTR2A, and HTR2B are GPCRs, while CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 are enzymes involved in drug metabolism. This interaction suggests potential effects on neurotransmission and pharmacokinetics. 
Related Gene Names:
- CYP2C19
This summary concludes the analysis of the molecule's potential interactions with the provided genes. If you need further details on any specific gene or additional related genes, feel free to ask!
