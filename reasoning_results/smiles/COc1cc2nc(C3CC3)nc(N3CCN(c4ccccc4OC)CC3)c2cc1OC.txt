Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc2nc(C3CC3)nc(N3CCN(c4ccccc4OC)CC3)c2cc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that includes functional groups such as carbonyl (CO), aromatic rings, amine (-NH2), and ether (-O-). The presence of these functional groups suggests the molecule could interact with various biological targets, including receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: Among the given genes, those involved in receptor function and signaling are likely to have a direct relationship with this molecule due to its potential to bind to these proteins. Receptors often contain hydrophobic pockets and binding sites for ligands, which might be suitable for the molecule’s structure.
Step 3: Genes associated with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are particularly relevant here. GPCRs are known to have seven transmembrane domains that can bind small molecules like the described compound. The related genes include CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, all of which code for different subtypes of GPCRs.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's ability to interact with enzymes cannot be ruled out. Enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are part of the cytochrome P450 family, play crucial roles in drug metabolism. The presence of aromatic rings and other functional groups in the molecule suggests it could be a substrate or inhibitor for these enzymes.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structural characteristics and the functions of the listed genes, the related genes are: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4.
