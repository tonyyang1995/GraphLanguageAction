Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc2c(c[n+](C)c3c4cc5c(cc4ccc23)OCO5)c1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule provided has a complex structure with multiple functional groups including an aromatic ring (cyclohexane), a nitrogen atom with positive charge, and several oxygen-containing functional groups such as esters and hydroxyls. This structure suggests it could interact with proteins that have binding sites for aromatic rings, positively charged groups, and/or hydrophobic/hydrophilic regions.
Step 2: Looking at the genes listed, many are associated with receptors and enzymes that might bind to or be affected by a molecule like this. For example, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4 are all G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) which often bind to small molecules. These receptors typically recognize hydrophobic ligands and can be influenced by positively charged groups and aromatic rings.
Step 3: The CYP family of genes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) encode cytochrome P450 enzymes that metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics. The molecule's presence could potentially affect the activity of these enzymes due to its complex structure, which might include substrates for these enzymes.
Step 4: Genes like HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C code for serotonin receptors, which are also GPCRs and could interact with the molecule due to similar structural characteristics as the ones mentioned in Step 2.
Step 5: Given the molecule's structure, it is likely to interact with a subset of these genes, specifically those involved in GPCR signaling pathways (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C) and metabolic pathways involving CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
