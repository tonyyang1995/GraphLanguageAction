Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=S(=O)(c1ccc2c(c1)C(=NO)c1cc(S(=O)(=O)[NH+]3CCCCC3)ccc1-2)[NH+]1CCCCC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure containing a sulfonamide (S=O), a nitro group (-NO2), and multiple aromatic rings. These functional groups suggest that the molecule could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction, metabolism, and receptor binding.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of a nitro group and aromatic rings indicates potential interactions with enzymes involved in phase I and II metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. These enzymes are crucial for drug metabolism and can affect the pharmacokinetics of the molecule.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a quinolone-like structure, which might interact with ion channels or receptors. For instance, the quinolone motif is known to bind to voltage-gated sodium channels, and this could be relevant for genes like KCNH2, which encodes the hERG potassium channel.
Step 4: Given the presence of amide and amine functionalities, the molecule may also interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This suggests potential interactions with genes encoding various GPCRs, including HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are involved in serotonin signaling.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule’s structure could potentially interact with kinases, such as those encoded by CDK2 and LCK, due to the presence of phosphate-like groups and aromatic rings that can mimic phosphorylation sites or interact with kinase domains.
