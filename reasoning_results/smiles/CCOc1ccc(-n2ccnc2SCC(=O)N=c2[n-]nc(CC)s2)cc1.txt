Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOc1ccc(-n2ccnc2SCC(=O)N=c2[n-]nc(CC)s2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with an attached carboxylic acid group (-COOH), a nitrogen atom with a double bond to a carbon (indicated by n2ccnc2), and a sulfur atom (S) connected to a carboxylic acid group. These structural features suggest the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a sulfhydryl group (-SH) indicates the molecule may interact with proteins containing acidic or thiol functional groups, such as certain ion channels or transporters.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a quinoline-like structure (Cc1ccc(-n2ccnc2SCC(=O)N=c2[n-]nc(CC)s2)), which is often found in compounds that inhibit enzymes such as CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize many drugs.
Step 4: Given the potential for this molecule to interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, it is likely to have effects on genes encoding these enzymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.
Step 5: Additionally, due to the presence of a quinoline-like structure, there might be interactions with receptors that bind ligands with similar structures, such as HTR2A (serotonin receptor) and DRD2 (dopamine receptor).
Summary of related gene names: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, DRD2. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with an attached carboxylic acid group (-COOH), indicating potential interactions with proteins that recognize acidic functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom with a double bond to a carbon (indicated by n2ccnc2) suggests the molecule may interact with proteins containing basic functional groups, such as ion channels or transporters.
Step 3: The quinoline-like structure (Cc1ccc(-n2ccnc2SCC(=O)N=c2[n-]nc(CC)s2)) in the molecule is characteristic of compounds that can inhibit enzymes like CYP2D6 and CYP3A4.
Step 4: The interaction of this molecule with CYP enzymes could affect genes such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 5: The potential for this molecule to interact with receptors like serotonin (HTR2A) and dopamine (DRD2) receptors, due to its quinoline-like structure, further suggests it could be related to genes encoding these receptors.
Summary of related gene names: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, DRD2. Step 1: The molecule has a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), suggesting possible interactions with enzymes or receptors
