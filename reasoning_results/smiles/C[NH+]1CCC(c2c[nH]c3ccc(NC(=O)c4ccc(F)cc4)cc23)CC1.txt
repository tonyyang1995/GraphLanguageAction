Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+]1CCC(c2c[nH]c3ccc(NC(=O)c4ccc(F)cc4)cc23)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule contains a quinoline-like structure, which is a common pharmacophore found in many drugs that interact with various receptors and transporters. The presence of this structure suggests potential interactions with membrane-bound proteins, particularly those involved in neurotransmission and hormone signaling.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a benzene ring system, which is often associated with drug molecules that bind to or modulate enzymes such as cytochrome P450s (CYPs). This indicates possible interactions with genes encoding for CYP enzymes, specifically CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule has a carboxamide group (-CONH2), which is known to be an important functional group for ligands binding to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This feature points towards potential interactions with GPCRs like DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), HTR1A (serotonin receptor 1A), HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A), HTR2B (serotonin receptor 2B), and HTR2C (serotonin receptor 2C).
Step 4: The presence of a pyrrole ring in the molecule could indicate interaction with ion channels or transporters. Notably, this might relate to genes such as KCNH2 (potassium channel subfamily H member 2) and SLC6A4 (solute carrier family 6 member 4, which is involved in the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine).
Step 5: Given the diverse pharmacophoric elements in the molecule, it is likely to interact with multiple genes involved in neurotransmission, hormone signaling, and drug metabolism. These include: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, SLC6A4, and possibly others not directly mentioned but sharing similar functional roles.
