Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])c1ccc([O-])cc1[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a trisodium salt of oxalic acid ester of 2-methoxy-5-nitrobenzoic acid (also known as NS-398). This compound has a structure consisting of an oxazole ring fused to a pyridine ring, with a nitro group and a methoxy group attached to the aromatic ring.
Step 2: The molecule contains functional groups such as carboxyl (-COOH), amide (-CONH2), and hydroxyl (-OH) groups. These functional groups are important for its potential interactions with proteins and enzymes.
Step 3: Considering the structure and functional groups of the molecule, it is likely to interact with enzymes that metabolize drugs and other xenobiotics, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs). Among the provided genes, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 are directly involved in drug metabolism via these enzymes.
Step 4: The molecule may also interact with ion channels and receptors. It contains a benzene ring which could potentially interact with ion channels like KCNH2 (hERG potassium channel) and HRH1 (histamine H1 receptor).
Step 5: Given the presence of an amide and carboxylic acid group, the molecule could interact with receptors that bind to small molecules, such as HTR2A (serotonin 5-HT2A receptor) and HTR2B (serotonin 5-HT2B receptor). Additionally, the nitro group might contribute to interactions with other receptors.
Summary of related gene names: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, KCNH2, HRH1, HTR2A, HTR2B. Step 1: The given molecule is a trisodium salt of oxalic acid ester of 2-methoxy-5-nitrobenzoic acid (NS-398).
Step 2: It contains functional groups such as carboxyl, amide, and hydroxyl.
Step 3: It may interact with CYP enzymes due to its structure.
Step 4: It could interact with ion channels and receptors.
Step 5: It may also interact with serotonin receptors.
