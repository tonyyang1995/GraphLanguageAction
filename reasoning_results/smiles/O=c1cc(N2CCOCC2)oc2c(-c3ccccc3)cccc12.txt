Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1cc(N2CCOCC2)oc2c(-c3ccccc3)cccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule, represented by the SMILES string O=c1cc(N2CCOCC2)oc2c(-c3ccccc3)cccc12, contains a benzene ring system with a nitrogen atom substituted by an amide group (-CONH2), which is a common pharmacophore for many drugs that interact with receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group in the molecule suggests potential interactions with enzymes such as CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize various drugs through oxidation processes involving amide groups.
Step 3: The nitrogen atom in the amide group could also participate in hydrogen bonding with receptors containing hydrophilic pockets, which might be relevant to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This could potentially relate to genes encoding GPCRs like DRD2, DRD3, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a benzene ring and the overall structure of the molecule may allow for interaction with other receptors and enzymes, possibly including those encoded by ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, and CACNA1H, which are involved in signal transduction pathways and cellular functions.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes include: CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, and CACNA1H. These genes are associated with drug metabolism, neurotransmission, and signal transduction pathways. 
Summary of related genes: CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CACNA1H.
