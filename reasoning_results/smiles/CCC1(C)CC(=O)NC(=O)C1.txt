Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCC1(C)CC(=O)NC(=O)C1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The SMILES string CCC1(C)CC(=O)NC(=O)C1 describes a molecule that is a derivative of benzene with an amide group attached to it. This molecule has a linear structure with a benzene ring, a central carbon atom, and an amide group (CON) attached to it. The presence of an amide group suggests this molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes that interact with such functional groups.
Step 2: Considering the potential interactions, the molecule might be related to genes encoding enzymes that metabolize compounds with amide groups, such as CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: Another potential interaction involves genes that encode receptors or ion channels, given the amide group and the overall structure. For example, CYP2C9, CYP1A2, and CYP3A4 are involved in drug metabolism but also have roles in signaling pathways that could be affected by the molecule's structure.
Step 4: Given the benzene ring and amide group, the molecule might also interact with genes involved in signal transduction pathways, such as HTR2A and HTR2B, which encode serotonin receptors, and KCNH2, which encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and its potential interactions, the related genes include: CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP1A2, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, and KCNH2. These genes play crucial roles in drug metabolism and signaling pathways, making them relevant to the molecule's possible biological activities. 
Summary of Related Genes: CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP1A2, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, KCNH2.
