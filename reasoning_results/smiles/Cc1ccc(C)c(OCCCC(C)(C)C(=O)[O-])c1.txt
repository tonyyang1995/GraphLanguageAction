Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(C)c(OCCCC(C)(C)C(=O)[O-])c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure containing a benzene ring system (Cc1ccc(C)c1), a pyrrole ring (OCCCC(C)(C)C(=O)), and an alcohol group (-[O-]). The benzene ring system is characteristic of many molecules that interact with or modulate the activity of certain receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring suggests potential interaction with aromatic amino acid residues in protein binding sites, particularly those involved in G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4). Additionally, the benzene ring could also interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are known to metabolize a wide range of drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: The pyrrole ring structure indicates a possible interaction with proteins that have specific binding pockets for heterocyclic compounds. This could be relevant for genes encoding receptors like the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CNR1), which binds endocannabinoids and exogenous cannabinoids, or the dopaminergic receptor D2 (DRD2), which is involved in the regulation of dopamine signaling.
Step 4: The alcohol group (-[O-]) could participate in hydrogen bonding interactions, which might be important for molecules that act as agonists or antagonists of various receptors. For instance, it could potentially interact with GPCRs (like HRH1 for histamine receptors) or ion channels (like KCNH2 for potassium channels).
Step 5: Based on the structural features described, the molecule could be related to several genes including: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CNR1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HRH1, and KCNH2.
