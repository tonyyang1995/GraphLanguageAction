Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Nc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)Nc2ccccc2)cc1)C1COc2ccccc2O1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring system, which is a common feature in many drugs that interact with receptors and enzymes. This structural motif may be relevant to genes encoding receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a thiazole ring and a sulfonyl group, which are often found in compounds that inhibit or modulate enzyme activity, particularly those involved in metabolism and signal transduction pathways.
Step 3: The presence of an aromatic amine and a quinoline-like structure suggests potential interactions with receptors such as adrenergic (ADRA1D, ADRA2B) and dopaminergic (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) receptors.
Step 4: The molecule's overall structure and functional groups could indicate interactions with enzymes like CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize various drugs.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and functional groups identified, the molecule may be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. 
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
