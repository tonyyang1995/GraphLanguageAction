Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1onc(-c2c(F)cccc2Cl)c1C(=O)N=c1[n-]nc(-c2ccccc2)s1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing several functional groups such as amide (C(=O)N), aromatic rings (c1...c1), heteroatoms like nitrogen (N) and chlorine (Cl), and substituents like fluorine (F). This structure suggests it could interact with proteins that bind to or are influenced by similar chemical moieties.
Step 2: Considering the presence of an amide group (C(=O)N) and aromatic rings, this molecule likely has the potential to modulate protein-protein interactions, particularly those involving enzymes or receptors that have similar binding sites.
Step 3: The presence of chlorine and fluorine substituents indicates the molecule might be involved in mechanisms related to signal transduction pathways, given these halogens are often found in drugs targeting ion channels and receptors.
Step 4: Given the complex structure and the specific features mentioned, the molecule could potentially interact with genes encoding for receptors, transporters, and enzymes. Examples include HTR (serotonin receptors), CYP (cytochrome P450 enzymes), and CHRM (cholinergic receptors).
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis and the potential interactions, the related genes would include: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4.
