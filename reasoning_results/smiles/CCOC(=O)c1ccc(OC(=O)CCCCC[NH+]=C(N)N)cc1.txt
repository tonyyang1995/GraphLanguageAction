Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)c1ccc(OC(=O)CCCCC[NH+]=C(N)N)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with an acetyl group (COCH3), a hydroxyl group (OH), and an amide group (-CONH2). These functional groups suggest the molecule may be involved in binding to receptors or enzymes that interact with such structures.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring with a carboxamide group (-CONH2) is characteristic of molecules that can act as ligands for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) or enzymes like monoamine oxidase (MAO). GPCRs are known to have binding sites for molecules with similar functional groups.
Step 3: Among the provided genes, several are associated with GPCRs or enzymes that might interact with the described functional groups:
- ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6: These genes encode GPCRs that could potentially bind to or be affected by the molecule due to its structural features.
Step 4: The CYP family of genes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) are involved in drug metabolism and detoxification. If the molecule is a substrate or inhibitor of these enzymes, it would be relevant to these genes.
Step 5: The related genes are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. These include GPCRs and enzymes involved in drug metabolism. 
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. 
These genes are primarily associated with GPCRs and enzymes involved in drug metabolism. The molecule's structure suggests potential interactions with these proteins.
