Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C=CC(=O)[NH+]1CCC(Oc2cc3c(=Nc4ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c4F)[n-]cnc3cc2OC)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a carboxyl group (C=CC(=O)) and an amide group attached to it, indicating potential activity as a ligand for receptors that interact with such functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of a quinoline-like structure (c2cc3c(=Nc4ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c4F)[n-]cnc3cc2) suggests potential interaction with genes involved in neurotransmitter signaling pathways.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a pyridine ring (c4ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c4F), which could indicate potential binding to enzymes involved in metabolism or signaling pathways.
Step 4: Given the structural features, the molecule may be related to genes involved in neurotransmission, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, due to their roles in serotonin receptor signaling.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule might have potential interactions with genes involved in G-protein coupled receptor signaling, such as CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4, due to the presence of cholinergic-like structures.
