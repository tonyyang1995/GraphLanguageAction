Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(CSc1nnc(-c2ccco2)c(-c2ccco2)n1)Nc1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring system and a pyridine ring, which are common in many ligands that interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This suggests potential interactions with genes encoding GPCRs.
Step 2: The molecule also has a tricyclic structure, which is characteristic of certain antidepressants and can interact with serotonin and norepinephrine transporters. This indicates possible interaction with genes involved in neurotransmitter regulation.
Step 3: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) and amide functionalities in the molecule could suggest interactions with enzymes like CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, which metabolize drugs containing such functional groups.
Step 4: Given the molecular structure, it is plausible that the molecule could bind to and modulate the activity of receptors encoded by genes like DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, and HTR2B, which are involved in dopaminergic and serotonergic signaling pathways.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule may be related to the following genes: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and possibly others involved in GPCR signaling and neurotransmitter metabolism. 
Summary of Related Genes: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, CYP2D6, CYP2C19.
