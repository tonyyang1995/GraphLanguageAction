Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccnc2c1NC(=O)c1cccnc1[NH+]2C1CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a quinoline ring system, which is a common pharmacophore found in many drugs that interact with various receptors and enzymes. This structural feature is indicative of potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule, particularly in the form of an amide group (-CONH2), suggests possible interaction with GPCRs such as D2-like dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4). These receptors are known to bind ligands containing basic functional groups like amides.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a benzene ring with a carboxamide group (-CONH2), which is reminiscent of substrates for cytochrome P450 enzymes, specifically CYP2D6. This enzyme is responsible for metabolizing a wide range of drugs, including those with similar chemical structures.
Step 4: The presence of a pyridine ring in the molecule might indicate potential binding to ion channels, such as the voltage-gated potassium channel encoded by KCNH2, due to the aromatic nature of the ring.
Step 5: Given the complex structure and the presence of functional groups like amides and carboxamides, the molecule could have diverse interactions with various enzymes and receptors. However, based on the identified features, the most likely related genes are those involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism, such as DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2D6, and KCNH2.
