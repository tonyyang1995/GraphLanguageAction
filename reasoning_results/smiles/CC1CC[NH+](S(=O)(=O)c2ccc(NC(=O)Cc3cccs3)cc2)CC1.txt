Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC1CC[NH+](S(=O)(=O)c2ccc(NC(=O)Cc3cccs3)cc2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound with multiple functional groups including an amide (NH+), a sulfoxide (S(=O)(=O)), and aromatic rings. This structure suggests it could interact with proteins that have binding sites for such functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of the amide group (NH+) indicates potential interaction with receptors that bind amine-containing ligands, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Among the provided genes, several are involved in the GPCR pathway, specifically ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
Step 3: The sulfoxide group (S(=O)(=O)) could indicate the molecule has redox properties or interacts with enzymes involved in oxidation-reduction reactions, which might relate to genes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, all of which are cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Step 4: Given the complexity and size of the molecule, it may also interact with membrane transporters, particularly those involved in neurotransmitter reuptake or release. Genes such as SLC6A2 and SLC6A4, which encode for sodium-dependent neurotransmitter transporters, could be relevant.
Step 5: Considering the detailed structure and potential interactions, the related genes include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4. These genes are primarily involved in receptor signaling and drug metabolism. 
Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
