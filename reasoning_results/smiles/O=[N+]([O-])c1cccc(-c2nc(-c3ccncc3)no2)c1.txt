Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=[N+]([O-])c1cccc(-c2nc(-c3ccncc3)no2)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a nitroso group (O=[N+]) attached to an aromatic ring, which suggests it may interact with proteins that have a role in signal transduction or neurotransmission due to its potential to form hydrogen bonds and stabilize protein conformation.
Step 2: The presence of an amide (-CONH-) and a hydroxyl (-OH) group indicates the molecule could be involved in interactions with receptors or enzymes that have hydrophobic and polar binding sites, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The cyclic structure and the presence of nitrogen atoms suggest the molecule might interact with ion channels or transporters, particularly those involving calcium or sodium ions, given the pattern of substituents around the ring.
Step 4: Given the molecule’s structure, it is likely to interact with GPCRs, which are encoded by genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These receptors play key roles in the modulation of neurotransmitter systems, including dopamine and serotonin pathways.
Step 5: The molecule may also interact with enzymes like CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are encoded by the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 genes respectively, due to their ability to metabolize drugs and xenobiotics.
Summary of related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
