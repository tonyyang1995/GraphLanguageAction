Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1cc(-c2ccccc2)oc2ccccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule is a heterocyclic compound with an aromatic ring system and a pyridine ring fused to a benzene ring, which is typical for many drugs that interact with receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) attached to the aromatic ring, which is known to be involved in the activation of certain kinases and can modulate receptor activity.
Step 3: The presence of multiple aromatic rings and a cyano group suggests potential interactions with kinases such as ABL1, CDK2, and LCK, all of which are tyrosine kinases.
Step 4: The molecule's structure also hints at possible interactions with receptors, particularly those involved in neurotransmission, such as DRD2, DRD3, and HTR2A, due to its size and functional groups.
Step 5: Given the potential kinase and receptor interactions, the related genes include: ABL1, CDK2, LCK, DRD2, DRD3, and HTR2A. 
Related genes: ABL1, CDK2, LCK, DRD2, DRD3, HTR2A.
