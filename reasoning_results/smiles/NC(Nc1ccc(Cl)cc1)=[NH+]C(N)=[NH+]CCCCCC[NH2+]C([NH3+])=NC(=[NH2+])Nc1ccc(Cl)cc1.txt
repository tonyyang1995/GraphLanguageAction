Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NC(Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1)=[NH+]C(N)=[NH+]CCCCCC[NH2+]C([NH3+])=NC(=[NH2+])Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains multiple amine groups (-NH2), a carboxamide group (-CONH2), and a nitroso group (N=N-). These functional groups suggest the molecule could be involved in interactions with proteins that bind to or modify amines, carboxamides, or nitrogen-containing functionalities.
Step 2: Notably, the molecule has several aromatic rings and potentially reactive groups like the nitroso group, which might indicate involvement in signaling pathways or protein-protein interactions that require recognition of aromatic residues or modification of such residues.
Step 3: Given the presence of amine groups and the overall structure, this molecule might interact with receptors or enzymes that have amino acid binding sites, particularly those containing aromatic residues or basic amino acids that could form hydrogen bonds or electrostatic interactions.
Step 4: Considering the specific genes provided, the molecule could potentially relate to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to the presence of amine groups and the possibility of forming hydrogen bonds or other interactions with the receptor's extracellular domain. GPCRs include HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 5: The molecule may also interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, due to its potential for being metabolized or acting as a substrate for these enzymes.
