Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(C(=O)C(C)C[NH+]2CCCCC2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups including a carboxamide group (-CONH), a phenyl ring, and several alkyl chains. This suggests the molecule could be a small organic compound with potential pharmacological activity.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH) indicates that this molecule may act as an inhibitor or activator of enzymes containing catalytic amide hydrolase activity. This functional group is commonly found in drugs that interact with various receptors and transporters.
Step 3: Given the pattern of the molecule, it might have a high affinity for certain receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmission and hormone signaling pathways. Specifically, it could interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other membrane-bound proteins due to its hydrophobic core and polar headgroup.
Step 4: Considering the molecular features, the compound could potentially affect genes encoding for receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), and serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6). It might also influence genes encoding for enzymes involved in drug metabolism like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
Step 5: The molecule's structure and potential interactions suggest it could modulate the function of the listed genes involved in neurotransmission, hormone signaling, and drug metabolism. Based on the analysis, the related gene names are:
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- ADRB2
- CHRM1
- CHRM3
- CHRM4
- DRD2
- DRD3
- DRD4
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- HTR6
- CYP1A2
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
Note: Some of the other genes mentioned (e.g., ABCB1, ABL1, etc.) are not directly related to the molecule based on its structure and the described interactions. Therefore, they are not included in the final list of related genes. The summary focuses on those genes most likely to be affected by the molecule's structure and potential pharmacological activities.
