Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1c(-c2ccccc2)c([O-])c2cccc3c2n1CCC3, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this might be important.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is characteristic of many drugs that interact with receptors and enzymes. This structural feature may suggest potential interactions with genes encoding for receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) and a nitro group (-NO2) within the molecule indicates the possibility of electrophilic reactivity and potential for covalent binding to proteins, including enzymes and receptors. This could imply a relationship with genes involved in drug metabolism and signaling pathways.
Step 3: The molecule also has a quinoline ring, which is known to interact with various receptors and ion channels. This suggests a possible interaction with genes encoding for receptors and ion channels.
Step 4: Given the complex structure of the molecule, it likely interacts with multiple targets, potentially affecting several genes. However, based on the specific functional groups and the overall structure, the molecule seems more likely to interact with genes involved in neurotransmitter signaling and drug metabolism.
Step 5: Based on the analysis, the following genes are most likely to be related to the molecule: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, and SLC6A4.
