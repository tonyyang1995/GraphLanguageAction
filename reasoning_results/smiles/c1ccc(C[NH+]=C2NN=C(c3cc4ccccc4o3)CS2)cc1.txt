Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: c1ccc(C[NH+]=C2NN=C(c3cc4ccccc4o3)CS2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure including aromatic rings, a heterocyclic amine (indicated by [NH+]), and a sulfonamide group. These features suggest potential interactions with enzymes or receptors involved in neurotransmission or metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a positively charged nitrogen atom ([NH+]) and a sulfonamide group (CS2) indicates that this molecule could act as a ligand for ion channels or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are often involved in signal transduction pathways and are associated with various physiological processes including neurotransmission.
Step 3: Considering the pattern of the molecule, it may interact with genes encoding neurotransmitter receptors and transporters, such as those involved in dopaminergic pathways. Dopamine receptors (e.g., DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) are key components of these pathways and are implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure might also suggest interactions with genes encoding enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4. These enzymes are part of the cytochrome P450 family and play crucial roles in the biotransformation of xenobiotics and endogenous compounds.
Step 5: Based on the analysis of the molecule's structure and its potential interactions, the related genes include: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4. These genes are involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism, respectively. 
Summary of related gene names: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4.
