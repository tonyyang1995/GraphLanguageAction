Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C#CC[NH+](C)Cc1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge, indicated by [NH+], which suggests it could be an amine derivative with potential proton pump inhibitor activity.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring (C#CC) indicates aromaticity, which is common in many drug molecules and can interact with various receptors and ion channels.
Step 3: The cyclic structure (Cc1ccccc1) resembles a pyridine ring, which is often involved in interactions with neurotransmitter receptors and enzymes.
Step 4: Given the structure, this molecule may have potential interactions with genes encoding neurotransmitter receptors such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, as well as enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 that metabolize similar compounds.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule might interact with genes related to ion channels and transporters, including KCNH2 and SLC6A4.
