Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: c1ccc(-c2nnc(SCc3nc4ccccc4[n-]3)n2Cc2ccco2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with multiple functional groups including nitrogen-containing heterocycles, aromatic rings, and hydroxyl groups. The presence of these functional groups suggests that the molecule may have various biological activities, such as binding to receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: Among the listed genes, several are involved in drug metabolism and receptor signaling pathways. CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) play crucial roles in metabolizing drugs, while receptors like DRD2, HTR2A, and CHRM1 are involved in neurotransmission. The presence of these functional groups in the molecule indicates potential interactions with these proteins.
Step 3: The nitrogen-containing heterocycles and aromatic rings in the molecule could potentially interact with the active sites of CYP enzymes, allowing for substrate binding and catalysis. This interaction would be particularly relevant for CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize a wide range of substrates.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure might enable it to bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as DRD2, HTR2A, and CHRM1, which are known targets for drugs affecting neurotransmitter signaling. The hydroxyl groups could also contribute to hydrogen bonding, enhancing the binding affinity.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and the potential for interaction with the listed genes, the related gene names are: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, and CHRM1.
