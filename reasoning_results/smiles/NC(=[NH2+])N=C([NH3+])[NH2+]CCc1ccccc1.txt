Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NC(=[NH2+])N=C([NH3+])[NH2+]CCc1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with an amide group (-CONH2) and a nitrile group (C#N), which are characteristic features of many drugs that interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This pattern suggests potential interactions with receptors that have similar structural motifs.
Step 2: The presence of multiple amine groups (NH2+) and amines (NH3+) in the molecule indicates it could be a ligand for various receptors that bind to amino groups, such as muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M-channels) and dopamine receptors.
Step 3: The cyclic structure with aromatic rings and amine functionalities is reminiscent of molecules that modulate ion channels, particularly those involved in calcium signaling pathways. For instance, CACNA1H encodes a voltage-gated calcium channel subunit, which could potentially interact with this molecule.
Step 4: Given the complex aromatic structure and the presence of functional groups that can form hydrogen bonds and other interactions with proteins, the molecule may interact with enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) that metabolize drugs.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and functional groups, the molecule might also interact with receptors involved in neurotransmission, such as dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Summary of related gene names:
- Dopamine receptors: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4
- Serotonin receptors: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4
- Calcium channels: CACNA1H
- Drug metabolism enzymes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4
Note: Other genes listed do not have a direct structural or functional connection based on the provided molecular structure. The relationships outlined are speculative based on common pharmacological patterns and do not necessarily imply that the molecule directly interacts with these genes. Further experimental validation would be required to confirm any interactions.
