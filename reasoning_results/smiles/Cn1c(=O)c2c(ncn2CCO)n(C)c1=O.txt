Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cn1c(=O)c2c(ncn2CCO)n(C)c1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with a core structure that includes a benzene ring, an amide group, and multiple nitrogen-containing heterocycles. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in neurotransmitter systems and signaling pathways.
Step 2: The presence of amide and ester groups indicates that the molecule could act as a ligand for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are known to be involved in various physiological processes mediated by neurotransmitters and hormones. GPCRs often have specific binding sites for drugs and natural ligands, making them targets for molecules with similar functional groups.
Step 3: Considering the pattern of nitrogen-containing heterocycles, this molecule may interact with ion channels, particularly those involved in calcium or potassium currents, as these channels frequently contain binding sites for ligands with similar structural features. For example, the CACNA1H gene encodes a calcium channel subunit, which might be relevant if the molecule has calcium channel-blocking activity.
Step 4: Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, this molecule could also influence enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes. The CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 genes encode enzymes that metabolize many drugs, including some that interact with neurotransmitter systems. If the molecule mimics the structure of substrates for these enzymes, it might alter their activity, potentially affecting the levels of neurotransmitters.
Step 5: Based on the structure and potential interactions described, the molecule could be related to several genes involved in neurotransmitter systems and signal transduction, including but not limited to: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, KDR, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4.
