Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1n[n-]c(SC(C(=O)c2ccccc2)c2ccccc2)n1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex molecule with multiple functional groups, including a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring (indicated by the 'n' and 'c' atoms), a thiocyanate group (-SC-), and an amide group (C(=O)-). This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for these functional groups.
Step 2: Considering the presence of a thiocyanate group, the molecule could interact with enzymes involved in sulfur metabolism or detoxification processes. The thiocyanate group might also be relevant to the activity of certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP) that metabolize thiocyanates.
Step 3: Given the presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring and an amide group, this molecule may have affinity for receptors or ion channels that contain similar functional groups in their binding sites. This is particularly relevant for genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels.
Step 4: Among the listed genes, those encoding GPCRs and ion channels are potentially relevant. Specifically, CHRM1 (cholinergic receptor, muscarinic 1), CHRM3 (cholinergic receptor, muscarinic 3), and CHRM4 (cholinergic receptor, muscarinic 4) are likely candidates due to their muscarinic acetylcholine receptor function, which involves binding to ligands with similar functional groups.
Step 5: Additionally, genes involved in neurotransmitter signaling and metabolism, such as HTR1A (serotonin receptor 1A), HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A), HTR2B (serotonin receptor 2B), and HTR2C (serotonin receptor 2C), might also be relevant due to the presence of amide groups and nitrogen-containing rings in the molecule.
Summary of related gene names:
- CHRM1
- CHRM3
- CHRM4
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C Step 5: Summary of related gene names includes CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C. These genes encode receptors that may interact with the described molecule based on its functional groups and overall structure. The presence of amide and nitrogen-containing heterocyclic rings suggests potential binding interactions with these receptors, particularly those involved in cholinergic and serotonergic signaling pathways.
