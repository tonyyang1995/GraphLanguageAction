Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex molecule with multiple substructures. Notably, it contains several carboxylic acids (e.g., -COOH) and amides (-CONH-), which are common in many bioactive compounds. These functional groups suggest the molecule could interact with proteins that bind or catalyze reactions involving these functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of two distinct benzene rings connected via a carbon chain and containing various substituents such as methyl (-CH3) and ethyl (-C2H5) groups, indicates the molecule might have aromaticity and hydrophobic regions, which can be important for binding to receptors or enzymes. This structural feature aligns with ligands that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other membrane-bound proteins.
Step 3: The molecule also includes nitrogen-containing heterocycles, such as pyrroles and possibly imidazoles, which are known to form hydrogen bonds and can participate in the binding of ligands to receptors. This suggests the molecule may interact with proteins that have hydrogen-bonding sites, like certain GPCRs.
Step 4: Given the presence of multiple carboxylate groups (-COO-), the molecule could act as an inhibitor or activator of enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize drugs and other xenobiotics.
Step 5: Considering the overall complexity and the presence of functional groups that can form hydrogen bonds and interactions with aromatic rings, the molecule is likely to interact with GPCRs. Therefore, the genes related to this molecule are those encoding GPCRs, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
