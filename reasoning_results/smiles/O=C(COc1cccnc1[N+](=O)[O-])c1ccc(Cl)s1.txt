Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(COc1cccnc1[N+](=O)[O-])c1ccc(Cl)s1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a structure that includes a benzene ring with a carbonyl group (C=O) attached, which is common in many drug molecules and can interact with proteins such as enzymes and receptors. This pattern suggests potential interactions with genes involved in drug metabolism and receptor signaling.
Step 2: The molecule also contains a nitrosoamine group (-N+(-O)-) and a hydroxyl group (-OH), which are known to be involved in drug binding and activation. These functional groups may interact specifically with certain enzymes or receptors encoded by the genes listed.
Step 3: The presence of a quinoline-like structure (quinoline is a common pharmacophore) indicates that the molecule might interact with proteins that have quinoline-binding domains, such as certain ion channels or transporters. Genes like KCNH2, which encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel, could be relevant due to this structural similarity.
Step 4: The overall structure hints at potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), given its complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups that could bind to these receptors. Genes such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which encode serotonin receptors, might be relevant based on this feature.
Step 5: Considering the molecule’s diverse functional groups and complex structure, it is likely to interact with multiple genes involved in various pathways, including drug metabolism (e.g., CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), neurotransmission (e.g., HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C), and inflammation (e.g., PTGS1). However, the most specific interactions would likely involve genes encoding proteins that directly bind to or interact with the molecule's functional groups.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- PTGS1
- KCNH2 (for ion channel interactions) Step 5: Given the diverse interactions suggested, the molecule is most likely to be related to several genes involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmission, and inflammation. The specific interactions would depend on the precise binding sites and functional groups within the molecule. The genes listed above represent the primary areas of interaction. 
- KCNH2 (for ion channel interactions)
