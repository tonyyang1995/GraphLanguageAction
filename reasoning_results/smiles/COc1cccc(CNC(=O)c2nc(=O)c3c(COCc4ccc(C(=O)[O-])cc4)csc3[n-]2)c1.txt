Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cccc(CNC(=O)c2nc(=O)c3c(COCc4ccc(C(=O)[O-])cc4)csc3[n-]2)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex molecule that includes a benzene ring, a cyclic amide (amide bond), and several functional groups such as carboxylic acids, esters, and a pyrrolidine ring. These structural elements suggest the molecule may interact with proteins involved in signaling pathways, metabolism, and receptor binding.
Step 2: The presence of carboxylic acid and amide functionalities suggests the molecule could be an inhibitor or activator of enzymes involved in metabolic pathways. This aligns with the presence of several drug metabolism-related genes such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are involved in the metabolism of various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: The cyclic amide and ester functionalities also indicate potential interaction with receptors or ion channels. Genes like DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode for different subtypes of serotonin receptors, are involved in neurotransmission and could be targeted by this molecule due to its structural features.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a benzene ring and other aromatic moieties might suggest interactions with proteins involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, which is relevant to genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, and CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, which are all associated with adrenergic and cholinergic signaling pathways.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and functional groups, the molecule could potentially interact with multiple genes involved in different biological processes. However, based on the identified structural features, the most likely related genes are those involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), neurotransmission (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), and adrenergic and cholinergic signaling (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Summary of related genes:
- Drug metabolism: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4
- Neurotransmission: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- Adrenergic and cholinergic signaling: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4
Other genes listed do not appear to have a direct structural or functional relationship with the given molecule based on the provided information. Therefore, the focus should be on the aforementioned genes for further analysis.
