Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(NC(=O)c2ccc3c(=O)n(Cc4ccco4)c(=S)[n-]c3c2)c(OC)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is characteristic of many drugs and ligands that interact with receptors and transport proteins. This structural feature suggests that the molecule could potentially interact with proteins involved in signal transduction or drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) and an amide (-CONH-) group indicates that this molecule likely has electrophilic and nucleophilic functional groups, which can participate in covalent binding or hydrogen bonding interactions with proteins. These interactions are often seen in molecules that modulate the activity of enzymes or receptors.
Step 3: The aromatic nitro group (NO2) in the molecule might indicate the potential for redox reactions or interaction with enzymes involved in the metabolic pathways, such as those containing cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP family). This suggests a possible relationship with genes encoding these enzymes, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
Step 4: The presence of a thiol group (-SH) in the molecule, which is part of the sulfur-containing heterocyclic ring, may suggest a potential interaction with proteins that contain cysteine residues, such as ion channels or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This could be relevant for genes like KCNH2, which encodes a potassium channel, and HTR2A, which encodes a serotonin receptor.
Step 5: Given the overall structure and functional groups of the molecule, it appears to have the potential to interact with multiple targets, including enzymes involved in drug metabolism (CYP family), receptors (such as GPCRs and ion channels), and possibly transport proteins. Therefore, the molecule may be related to several of the listed genes, including CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, KCNH2, HTR2A, and others.
