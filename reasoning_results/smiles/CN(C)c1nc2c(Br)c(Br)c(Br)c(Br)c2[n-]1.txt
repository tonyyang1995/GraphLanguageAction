Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with multiple halogen substituents (Br), indicating potential interactions with proteins that have ligand binding sites, such as receptors and transporters.
Step 2: The presence of a pyridine ring with a nitrogen atom and a negative charge suggests it may interact with ion channels or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that contain similar functional groups.
Step 3: The pattern of halogenated aromatic compounds can be found in some ligands for receptors involved in signal transduction pathways, such as those regulated by GPCRs and ion channels.
Step 4: Considering the molecular structure, this compound could potentially interact with genes encoding for receptors like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, and CYP enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 due to their roles in drug metabolism and receptor signaling.
Step 5: The molecule's structure might also relate to genes involved in neurotransmitter systems, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, and HTR2B, due to the presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocycle.
