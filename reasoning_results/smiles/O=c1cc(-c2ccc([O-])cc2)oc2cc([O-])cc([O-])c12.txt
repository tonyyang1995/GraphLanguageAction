Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1cc(-c2ccc([O-])cc2)oc2cc([O-])cc([O-])c12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that contains a benzene ring system with an oxygen atom double-bonded to it (oxo group), a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH), and several substituents including another phenolic group and an alkyl chain with an oxygen-containing functional group. This structure suggests the molecule is likely an aromatic compound with potential bioactivity due to its polar and functional groups.
Step 2: Analyzing the molecular structure further, we observe that the presence of an oxygen atom double-bonded to a carbon (oxo group) and the presence of phenolic hydroxyl groups could indicate the molecule has the potential to interact with enzymes or receptors involved in signal transduction pathways. These functional groups are common in ligands for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: Given the structure's potential to interact with GPCRs, we can hypothesize that this molecule might be related to genes encoding GPCRs, which are involved in various physiological processes such as neurotransmission and hormone signaling. This is because the molecule’s functional groups can act as agonists or antagonists of these receptors.
Step 4: Among the listed genes, several are known to encode GPCRs, including DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), HTR1A (serotonin receptor 1A), HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A), HTR2B (serotonin receptor 2B), HTR2C (serotonin receptor 2C), HTR6 (serotonin receptor 6), CHRM1 (cholinergic receptor muscarinic M1), CHRM3 (cholinergic receptor muscarinic M3), and CHRM4 (cholinergic receptor muscarinic M4). These receptors are involved in various signaling pathways and neurotransmission.
Step 5: Therefore, based on the structure of the molecule and its potential to interact with GPCRs, the related genes include: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
