Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Sc1nnc(-c2ccccc2)o1)N1c2ccccc2Sc2ccccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other type of explanation.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring system, which is common in ligands for nuclear receptors and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature suggests potential interactions with genes involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring with substituents, such as cyano (-CN) and alkyl groups, indicates a pharmacophore that could bind to enzymes like CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a quinoline-like moiety, which is known to interact with GPCRs and ion channels. This part of the molecule may have relevance to genes such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and KCNH2, which encode serotonin receptors and potassium channels, respectively.
Step 4: The overall structure does not suggest direct binding to kinases, transcription factors, or other proteins listed in the provided gene list. However, its ability to modulate receptors and ion channels implies indirect effects through these mechanisms.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is most likely related to the following genes: CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, and KCNH2.
Related gene names: CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, KCNH2.
