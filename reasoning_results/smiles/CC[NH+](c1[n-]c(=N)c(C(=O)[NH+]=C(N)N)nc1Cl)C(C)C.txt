Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC[NH+](c1[n-]c(=N)c(C(=O)[NH+]=C(N)N)nc1Cl)C(C)C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this relationship might be significant.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring, which is part of a positively charged amine group (NH+) attached to a nitrogen atom. This structural feature suggests potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for basic amino groups, such as receptors or transporters.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH+) and a ketone group (C=O) indicates the molecule could interact with enzymes or receptors that recognize these functional groups. Specifically, it may bind to enzymes involved in metabolism or signaling pathways.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a benzene ring, which is often recognized by aromatic amino acids in protein binding sites, particularly those involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. This suggests possible interaction with GPCRs.
Step 4: Given the presence of a chlorine atom (Cl) and the overall structure, the molecule may act as a ligand for ion channels, particularly those that are sensitive to chloride ions or have similar structures.
Step 5: Considering the structural features identified, the molecule may be related to the following genes: ABL1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4. These genes encode proteins that include receptors, enzymes, and transporters that could potentially interact with the described molecular structure. Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring, which is part of a positively charged amine group (NH+), suggesting potential interactions with basic amino acid residues in protein binding sites.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH+) and a ketone group (C=O) indicates the molecule could interact with enzymes or receptors that recognize these functional groups, particularly those involved in metabolic pathways or signal transduction.
Step 3: The benzene ring in the molecule suggests possible interaction with proteins containing aromatic amino acids, which are common in receptor binding sites, especially GPCRs.
Step 4: The chlorine atom (Cl) and overall structure indicate the molecule may act as a ligand for ion channels or receptors sensitive to chloride ions.
Step 5: The related genes are: ABL1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4. These genes encode proteins that include receptors, enzymes, and transporters that could interact with the molecule's structure.
