Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains several functional groups such as amine (-NH2), carbonyl (C=O), and ester (-COO-). It also includes aromatic rings and heterocycles, which are common in drug-like molecules.
Step 2: The presence of amine groups (-NH2 and -NH+) suggests that this molecule may act as a ligand for receptors that have amino acid binding sites, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The molecule contains multiple functional groups that could interact with various proteins, including enzymes and ion channels. For instance, the ester and carbonyl groups could form hydrogen bonds or participate in hydrophobic interactions.
Step 4: Given the potential for the molecule to interact with proteins involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways, it is likely to be related to genes encoding for receptors and enzymes involved in these processes. Notably, the molecule might interact with GPCRs, which are encoded by genes such as DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule's structure might interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are involved in drug metabolism.
