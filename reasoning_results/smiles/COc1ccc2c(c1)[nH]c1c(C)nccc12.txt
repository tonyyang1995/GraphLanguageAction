Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c1c(C)nccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that includes a benzene ring, a nitrogen atom with an amine group, and a pyrrole ring. This structure suggests the molecule could be involved in interactions with receptors or enzymes that have similar functional groups or binding sites.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom with an amine group indicates potential for interactions with proteins containing amine-binding sites, such as receptors and enzymes. This feature is particularly relevant to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes like cytochrome P450s, which are known to interact with molecules containing nitrogen and aromatic rings.
Step 3: The benzene ring and pyrrole ring in the molecule suggest it might interact with enzymes and receptors that have a preference for aromatic compounds. For instance, cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and GPCRs (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) often bind to or metabolize aromatic molecules.
Step 4: Given the molecular structure, the molecule could potentially interact with GPCRs and enzymes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism and signaling pathways. This aligns with the involvement of genes encoding GPCRs (e.g., DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4) and enzymes involved in drug metabolism (e.g., CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is most likely to be related to genes encoding GPCRs and enzymes involved in drug metabolism. The related gene names are: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. 
Summary of Related Genes:
- DRD2, DRD3, DRD4
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4
- CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4
These genes encode proteins that are either GPCRs or enzymes involved in the metabolism of drugs and neurotransmitters. The molecule's structure supports its potential interaction with these proteins.
