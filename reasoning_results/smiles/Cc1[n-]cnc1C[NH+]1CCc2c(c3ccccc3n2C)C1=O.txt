Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1[n-]cnc1C[NH+]1CCc2c(c3ccccc3n2C)C1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a negative charge (n-), which suggests it may interact with proteins that have positively charged binding sites, such as ion channels or receptors.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-NH-COOH) indicates potential interactions with enzymes or receptors that have amino acid residues capable of forming hydrogen bonds.
Step 3: The aromatic ring structures and the presence of a quinoline-like moiety suggest possible interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Step 4: The presence of a pyridine ring and a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group could indicate potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like DRD2, HTR2A, and HTR2B, which are known to bind to various ligands.
Step 5: Given the structure, the molecule could potentially interact with multiple genes involved in neurotransmitter systems and signal transduction pathways, including DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, and CNR1.
