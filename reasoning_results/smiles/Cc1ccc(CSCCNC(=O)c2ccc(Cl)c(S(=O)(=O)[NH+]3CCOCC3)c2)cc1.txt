Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(CSCCNC(=O)c2ccc(Cl)c(S(=O)(=O)[NH+]3CCOCC3)c2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure containing multiple rings, including benzene rings and sulfur-containing heterocycles. This complexity suggests that it could interact with proteins involved in various cellular processes, such as signal transduction and receptor binding.
Step 2: Notably, the molecule contains a carboxamide group (-CONH-) and an ester group (-COO-), which are common functional groups in molecules that can bind to and modulate the activity of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are known to be regulated by various signaling pathways and are often associated with neurotransmitter and hormone receptors.
Step 3: Given the presence of these functional groups and the overall structure, the molecule might have affinity for receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), which are GPCRs involved in neurotransmission and play significant roles in mood, behavior, and addiction.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's potential to interact with GPCRs makes it plausible that it could affect the expression or function of other genes involved in neurotransmission and neurodegenerative processes, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode serotonin receptors.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the molecule may be relevant to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes are primarily involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways, particularly those related to adrenergic and dopaminergic systems, and serotonin receptors.
