Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc2ncnc(Sc3nnc(C)s3)c2cc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule, COc1cc2ncnc(Sc3nnc(C)s3)c2cc1OC, is a complex organic compound containing aromatic rings and heteroatoms such as nitrogen and oxygen. This structure suggests potential interactions with receptors or enzymes that are involved in neurotransmission or metabolism.
Step 2: Analyzing the genes provided, we see several categories including those related to neurotransmitters (e.g., DRD2, HTR2A), metabolic enzymes (e.g., CYP2C19, CYP2D6), and ion channels (e.g., KCNH2). Given the complexity of the molecule and its potential to interact with multiple biological targets, it is likely to affect a few of these pathways rather than just one.
Step 3: Considering the pattern of the molecule, which includes aromatic rings and heteroatoms, it could potentially bind to receptors or enzymes that have similar functional groups or binding sites. For example, the presence of nitrogen-containing heterocycles might allow for interaction with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like DRD2 and HTR2A.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule’s structure may also interact with metabolic enzymes such as those encoded by CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics. This interaction could influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the molecule.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: DRD2, HTR2A, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and possibly others like KCNH2 if it interacts with ion channels.
Summary of Related Genes: DRD2, HTR2A, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, KCNH2.
