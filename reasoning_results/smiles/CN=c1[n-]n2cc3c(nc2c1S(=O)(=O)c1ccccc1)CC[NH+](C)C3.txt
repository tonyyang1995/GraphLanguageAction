Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CN=c1[n-]n2cc3c(nc2c1S(=O)(=O)c1ccccc1)CC[NH+](C)C3, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule containing a benzene ring with various substituents, including a nitro group, a sulfoxide group, and alkyl chains. This structure suggests that the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of a sulfoxide group (S(=O)(=O)) is characteristic of certain inhibitors of CYP enzymes, which are involved in drug metabolism. Specifically, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are known to be inhibited by sulfoxides due to their ability to form covalent bonds with the heme iron of these enzymes.
Step 3: The alkyl chains and other substituents on the benzene ring may also interact with protein targets, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). For example, GPCRs like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4 (dopamine receptors), HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C (serotonin receptors), and CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4 (cholinergic receptors) have been implicated in various physiological and pathological processes.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a nitro group (-NO2) might indicate a potential interaction with enzymes such as CYP1A2, which metabolizes nitro compounds. However, this feature alone does not strongly suggest a direct relationship with any of the listed genes.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule is most likely related to the genes encoding CYP enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6) and GPCRs (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
