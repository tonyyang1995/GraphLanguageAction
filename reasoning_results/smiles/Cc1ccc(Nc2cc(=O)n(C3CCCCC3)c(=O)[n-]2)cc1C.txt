Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(Nc2cc(=O)n(C3CCCCC3)c(=O)[n-]2)cc1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with a benzene ring system, including a quinoline-like moiety (Cc1ccc), a pyrrole ring (Nc2cc), and several other heterocycles. These structural features suggest potential interactions with proteins that have similar chemical motifs or binding sites.
Step 2: The presence of a nitro group (-N=C=O) and an amide group (c(=O)[n-]) indicates that the molecule could be involved in interactions with enzymes and receptors that recognize such functional groups. This is particularly relevant for enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) which metabolize drugs and xenobiotics containing these groups.
Step 3: The molecule's aromatic nature and presence of multiple rings suggest it might interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Specifically, the quinoline-like moiety could potentially bind to adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 4: Given the presence of an amide and the overall structure, the molecule might also interact with receptors that are sensitive to ligands containing these functional groups, such as dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) and serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Step 5: Considering the above interactions, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
