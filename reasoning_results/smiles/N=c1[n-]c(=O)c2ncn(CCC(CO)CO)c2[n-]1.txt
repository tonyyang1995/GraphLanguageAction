Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N=c1[n-]c(=O)c2ncn(CCC(CO)CO)c2[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex molecule with a core structure that includes a nitrogen-containing heterocycle, a benzene ring, and several substituents such as amine groups, methyl groups, and an ester group. This structure suggests the molecule may be a ligand for receptors or enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: Analyzing the pattern of the molecule, it contains multiple functional groups that are commonly found in molecules interacting with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which include adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4). These receptors play crucial roles in neurotransmission and signaling cascades.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a cytochrome P450 enzyme system-related functional groups (such as those potentially found in CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6) indicates that the molecule might interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, which could affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs.
Step 4: The molecule also has a potential interaction with receptors that regulate serotonin levels (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) due to its structural similarity to known serotonin receptor ligands.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to have relationships with the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
