Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(N(CC2=[NH+]CCN2)c2cccc([O-])c2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule containing multiple functional groups such as amine (-NH2), carbonyl (C=O), imidazole (N=CH-C=), and a negatively charged oxygen (-O-). These functional groups suggest that the molecule may interact with proteins or enzymes involved in metabolism, neurotransmission, or signaling pathways.
Step 2: The presence of an amine group (-NH2) indicates potential interactions with receptors that have a positively charged binding site, such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Among the provided genes, several are GPCRs: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4. These receptors are known to bind small molecules and modulate their activity based on the chemical structure of the ligand.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a benzene ring system, which is common in many drugs and small molecules that interact with enzymes. This structural feature might be relevant to enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of various xenobiotics, including drugs. These enzymes are part of the cytochrome P450 family and are responsible for oxidizing substrates.
Step 4: The negatively charged oxygen (-O-) could indicate a salt-forming moiety, which might interact with positively charged residues on proteins or enzymes. This feature is particularly relevant to the enzyme CYP3A4, which has been implicated in drug-drug interactions due to its ability to form ionic bonds with negatively charged molecules.
Step 5: Based on the analysis of the molecule's structure and the provided gene list, the related genes are likely to be those involved in GPCR signaling (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) and drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
