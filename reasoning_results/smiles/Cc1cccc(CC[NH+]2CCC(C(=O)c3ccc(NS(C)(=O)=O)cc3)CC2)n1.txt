Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cccc(CC[NH+]2CCC(C(=O)c3ccc(NS(C)(=O)=O)cc3)CC2)n1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure featuring a fused ring system, including a benzene ring, a pyrrole ring, and a piperidine ring, along with an amide group and a quaternary ammonium group. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins that have similar functional groups or binding sites.
Step 2: The presence of a quaternary ammonium group, which is positively charged, indicates that the molecule could interact with negatively charged regions on protein surfaces, such as those found on receptors or enzymes. This feature is particularly relevant for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which often have charged residues in their transmembrane domains.
Step 3: Given the complexity of the molecule, it is likely to interact with multiple targets, but focusing on the most probable interaction partners, we see that several of the listed genes are involved in neurotransmitter signaling pathways and receptor functions. For instance, DRD2 (Dopamine Receptor D2), HTR1A (Serotonin Receptor 1A), HTR2A (Serotonin Receptor 2A), HTR2B (Serotonin Receptor 2B), and HTR2C (Serotonin Receptor 2C) are all GPCRs that could potentially bind to this molecule due to its charge and structural features.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule’s structure might also interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are cytochrome P450 enzymes known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics. These enzymes are crucial for understanding how the molecule might be processed in the body and its potential pharmacokinetic profile.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related gene names that are most likely to be affected or influenced by the molecule include: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4.
