Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cccc(C)c1NC(=O)C[NH+]1CC[NH+](CCCC(c2ccc(F)cc2)c2ccc(F)cc2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this is relevant to the drug's mechanism of action.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring fused to a benzene ring, which is characteristic of many ligands that interact with nuclear receptors such as PPARγ (encoded by PPARG). This structural feature suggests potential interaction with PPARG.
Step 2: Additionally, the molecule has multiple aromatic rings and functional groups like amide and ester, which are often involved in binding to enzymes and receptors such as CYP enzymes (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). These functional groups can facilitate interactions with these enzymes.
Step 3: The presence of a quinoline ring in the molecule could indicate potential interaction with the G protein-coupled receptor family, particularly those involved in neurotransmission such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4 (encoded by genes for dopamine receptors).
Step 4: The molecule also includes a phenyl ring and amine functionalities, which may suggest interaction with cholinergic receptors such as CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4 (encoded by genes for muscarinic acetylcholine receptors).
Step 5: The overall structure and functional groups of the molecule point towards possible interactions with a few genes, including PPARG, CYP enzymes, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
