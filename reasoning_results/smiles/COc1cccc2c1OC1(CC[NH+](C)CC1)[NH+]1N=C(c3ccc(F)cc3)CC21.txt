Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cccc2c1OC1(CC[NH+](C)CC1)[NH+]1N=C(c3ccc(F)cc3)CC21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings and functional groups including an aromatic ring system, a carbonyl group, and amine functionalities. These features suggest potential interactions with proteins involved in neurotransmission, hormone signaling, and drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of amine groups, particularly the positively charged [NH+] and [NH+]1, indicates that the molecule could interact with receptors that have amino acid binding sites, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels. This is relevant to genes encoding GPCRs and ion channels.
Step 3: The aromatic ring system and the presence of fluorine atoms in the molecule might allow it to interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as cytochrome P450s (CYP enzymes). This is pertinent to genes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 4: Given the presence of a carbonyl group and other functional groups, the molecule could potentially act as a ligand for nuclear receptors, which are transcription factors involved in regulating gene expression. This is relevant to genes like NR1 (CNR1), which encodes a cannabinoid receptor.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and the presence of functional groups, the molecule may also interact with kinases, which are enzymes that phosphorylate other proteins. This is relevant to genes like LCK (Lck), which encodes a tyrosine kinase.
Summary of related gene names:
- ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2
- CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4
- CNR1
- LCK
- DRD2, DRD3, DRD4
These genes are related to the potential pharmacological activities and molecular targets of the described molecule.
