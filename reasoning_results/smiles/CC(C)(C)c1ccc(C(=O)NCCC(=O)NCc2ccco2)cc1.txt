Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)(C)c1ccc(C(=O)NCCC(=O)NCc2ccco2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with several functional groups such as amides (N-C=O), esters (O-C=O), aromatic rings (c1ccc...cc1), and heterocycles (C(=O)N). This complexity suggests it could interact with multiple biological targets, but we need to identify specific patterns that align with known drug-gene interactions.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (N-C=O) in the molecule, particularly in the substructure C(=O)NCCC(=O)NC, is notable. Amides are common in drugs that interact with enzymes and receptors involved in neurotransmission. This feature points towards potential interactions with genes encoding receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism.
Step 3: The presence of aromatic rings (c1ccc...cc1) and heterocyclic structures (C(=O)N) in the molecule suggests it may have affinity for proteins containing similar structural elements, such as ion channels or transporters. This could imply interaction with genes like KCNH2 (potassium channel) and SLC6A4 (serotonin transporter).
Step 4: Considering the amide and ester functionalities, the molecule might also interact with enzymes involved in metabolic pathways, potentially related to CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) which are known to metabolize many drugs.
Step 5: Given the above structural features, the most likely related genes would be those involved in neurotransmission and metabolism. Therefore, the related gene names include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and SLC6A4.
