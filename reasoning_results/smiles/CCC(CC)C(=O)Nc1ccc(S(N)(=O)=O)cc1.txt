Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCC(CC)C(=O)Nc1ccc(S(N)(=O)=O)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this relationship might be important.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is part of the SMILES string "CCC(CC)C(=O)Nc1ccc(S(N)(=O)=O)cc1". Benzene rings are often found in molecules that interact with receptors or enzymes, suggesting potential interaction with genes involved in signaling pathways or drug metabolism.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a quinoline-like structure with a nitro group (-NO2) attached to it. This functional group is known to interact with certain receptors and enzymes, indicating possible interaction with genes encoding proteins that bind or metabolize similar functional groups.
Step 3: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH2) in the molecule suggests it could be an inhibitor or activator of enzymes that have this group as a binding site, such as kinases. This points to potential interaction with genes like CDK2, which encodes a cyclin-dependent kinase.
Step 4: Given the overall structure and functional groups present, the molecule could potentially interact with receptors that have hydrophobic binding pockets or ligand-binding domains, which might include genes such as DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), HTR1A (serotonin receptor 1A), and HRH1 (histamine receptor H1).
Step 5: The molecule's structure and functional groups may also suggest interactions with genes involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways, as it has features that could fit into the binding sites of these receptors, including ADRB2 (adrenergic receptor beta-2), ADRA1D, and ADRA2B.
