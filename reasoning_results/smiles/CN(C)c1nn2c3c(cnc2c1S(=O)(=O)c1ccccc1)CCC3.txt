Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CN(C)c1nn2c3c(cnc2c1S(=O)(=O)c1ccccc1)CCC3, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with a sulfur-containing group attached, which is characteristic of thiophene rings. This structure is often found in molecules that interact with certain receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of multiple aromatic rings and functional groups such as amides and esters suggests the molecule could act as an agonist or antagonist for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are involved in signaling pathways regulated by various genes like DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C.
Step 3: The molecule also has a quinoline-like structure, which may indicate potential interactions with CYP enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, known for their role in drug metabolism.
Step 4: Given the presence of a nitro group and a carboxamide, the molecule might have affinity for ion channels, particularly those involving KCNH2, which codes for a voltage-gated potassium channel.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and functional groups, the molecule is likely to interact with multiple neurotransmitter systems and metabolic pathways, potentially affecting genes such as DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and KCNH2.
Summary of related genes: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, KCNH2.
