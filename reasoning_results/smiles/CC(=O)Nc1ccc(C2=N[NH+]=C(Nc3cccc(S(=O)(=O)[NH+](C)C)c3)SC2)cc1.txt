Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(C2=N[NH+]=C(Nc3cccc(S(=O)(=O)[NH+](C)C)c3)SC2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a core structure of an amide (CC(=O)) connected to an amino group (N), indicating it could be an organic compound such as a drug or a small molecule ligand. This structural feature suggests potential interaction with receptors or enzymes that bind to amino groups.
Step 2: The presence of a substituted benzene ring (c1ccc(C2=N[NH+])cc1) with a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (S(=O)(=O)[NH+]) attached through a sulfur atom indicates the molecule might interact with proteins involved in signaling pathways or enzymatic reactions, particularly those involving aromatic rings and sulfur-containing moieties.
Step 3: The sulfur-containing heterocycle (S(=O)(=O)[NH+]) and the presence of multiple nitrogen atoms (including positively charged ones) suggest the molecule could act as a ligand for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or other receptors that recognize nitrogen-containing ligands, such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 4: The presence of a cytosine ring (C2=N[NH+]) within the molecule might indicate a potential interaction with enzymes involved in DNA or RNA metabolism, such as those encoded by the CYP family of enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). Additionally, the presence of a benzene ring and the overall molecular structure may suggest potential interactions with kinases (e.g., CDK2, LCK, MCL1) or receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g., KDR, FLT1).
Step 5: The overall structure and functional groups of the molecule point towards its possible role in modulating neurotransmitter systems, as it contains features similar to known ligands for receptors involved in neurotransmission, such as dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), and opioid receptors (OPRK1). It also suggests potential interactions with estrogen receptors (ESR1) and other nuclear receptors (PPARG, SIGMAR1).
