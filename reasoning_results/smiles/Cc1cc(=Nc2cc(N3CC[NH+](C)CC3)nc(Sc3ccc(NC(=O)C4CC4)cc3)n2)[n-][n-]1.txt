Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc(=Nc2cc(N3CC[NH+](C)CC3)nc(Sc3ccc(NC(=O)C4CC4)cc3)n2)[n-][n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure containing a benzene ring system, a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (imidazole), and a carboxylic acid group. The presence of a carboxylic acid suggests potential interactions with ion channels or receptors that have acidic ligand binding sites.
Step 2: The benzene rings and nitrogen-containing heterocycles are characteristic of many receptor ligands, particularly those for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature might allow the molecule to interact with various GPCRs, which are encoded by multiple genes listed here such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
Step 3: The imidazole ring, which is part of the nitrogen-containing heterocycle, can form hydrogen bonds with proteins, including enzymes and receptors. This property could lead to interactions with enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: Given the presence of a carboxylic acid group, the molecule may be able to modulate ion channels, such as KCNH2, which encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel. Ion channel modulation can affect neurotransmitter release and signaling, potentially influencing genes like HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode serotonin receptors.
Step 5: The overall structure suggests the molecule could act as a ligand for various receptors and channels, but the most likely targets based on the given structure would be the GPCRs and ion channels mentioned above. Therefore, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, KCNH2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. 
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, KCNH2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure containing a benzene ring system, a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (imidazole), and a carboxylic acid group. The presence of a carboxylic acid suggests potential interactions with ion channels or receptors that have acidic ligand binding sites.
Step 3: The imid
