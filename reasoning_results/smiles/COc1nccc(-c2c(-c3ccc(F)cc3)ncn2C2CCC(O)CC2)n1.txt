Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1nccc(-c2c(-c3ccc(F)cc3)ncn2C2CCC(O)CC2)n1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a naphthylamine core with multiple functional groups including a nitro group, fluorine substituents, and an oxygen-containing moiety. These structural features suggest potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme substrates like CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 indicates that this molecule could be metabolized by these enzymes. This relationship is particularly relevant for understanding its pharmacokinetics and potential drug-drug interactions.
Step 3: Given the presence of a benzene ring and potential for aromatic amine functionality, there is a possibility of interaction with genes involved in neurotransmitter systems, such as DRD2 (Dopamine Receptor D2), HTR1A (Serotonin Receptor 1A), and HTR2A (Serotonin Receptor 2A).
Step 4: The molecule's structure also suggests potential binding to receptors like HRH1 (Histamine H1 Receptor) and CHRM1 (Cholinergic Receptor Muscarinic M1), which are associated with neurotransmission and signaling pathways.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and the described interactions, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HRH1, and CHRM1. Step 6: Summary of related genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HRH1, CHRM1.
