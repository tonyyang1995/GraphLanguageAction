Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc2c(cc1OC)C[NH+](CCc1ccc(-n3nnc(-c4cc(OC)c(OC)cc4NC(=O)c4cc(=O)c5ccccc5o4)n3)cc1)CC2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this might be clinically relevant.
Step 1: The molecule contains a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) and a pyrrolidine ring, which are common in ligands that interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature suggests potential interaction with receptors that have similar binding sites.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a nitrile group (-CN) indicates that the molecule could act as a modulator or inhibitor of enzymes such as CYP2D6, which metabolizes drugs through oxidation reactions involving these functional groups.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a benzene ring with substituents, which is characteristic of molecules that can bind to ion channels or transport proteins. For instance, the benzene ring could interact with voltage-gated sodium channels or potassium channels, such as those encoded by KCNH2.
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule, including its aromatic rings and heterocycles, may enable it to form hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions with the active sites of receptors like HTR2A, which is involved in serotonin signaling.
Step 5: Given the diverse functional groups and structural motifs present in the molecule, it is likely to interact with multiple targets, including but not limited to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4. Step 5: Related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
