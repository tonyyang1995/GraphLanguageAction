Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule, represented by the SMILES string "COc1c2occc2cc2ccc(=O)oc12", appears to be a complex organic compound with a benzene ring fused to an imidazole ring and containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This structure suggests that it could be a ligand or substrate for enzymes involved in drug metabolism or neurotransmitter signaling.
Step 2: Considering the structure, the molecule likely interacts with enzymes or receptors that are involved in pathways regulated by drugs or neurotransmitters. Notably, the presence of a carboxylic acid group and aromatic rings is common in molecules that can bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are encoded by genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 3: The benzene ring and carboxylic acid functional groups also suggest potential interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a benzene ring and carboxylic acid could indicate a potential interaction with other metabolic enzymes like CYP3A4, which metabolizes a wide range of drugs, including those that might interact with the aforementioned receptors and enzymes.
Step 5: Given the structural characteristics and the potential for interactions with both GPCRs and metabolic enzymes, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. These genes encode proteins that are directly involved in the binding, metabolism, or regulation of the molecule.
