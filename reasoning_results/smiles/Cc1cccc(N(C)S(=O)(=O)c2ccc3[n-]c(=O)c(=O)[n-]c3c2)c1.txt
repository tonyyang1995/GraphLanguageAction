Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cccc(N(C)S(=O)(=O)c2ccc3[n-]c(=O)c(=O)[n-]c3c2)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a nitrogen atom (N) attached to a sulfur atom (S), forming an N-S bond. This type of functional group, known as a thioether, is often involved in interactions with proteins that have cysteine residues, which are common in many receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) connected to a nitrogen atom. Sulfonamides are known to interact with various enzymes and transporters, including those encoded by genes such as ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein), which is involved in drug efflux and is a key player in drug resistance mechanisms.
Step 3: The presence of a nitrile group (-CN) and amide groups (-CONH2) suggests potential interactions with proteins that contain amino acid sequences rich in hydrogen-bonding residues, such as those found in receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmitter signaling pathways. For example, HTR2A and HTR2B, which encode serotonin receptors, might be influenced by such groups due to their role in modulating neurotransmission.
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule, particularly the aromatic rings and the presence of heteroatoms like nitrogen and sulfur, could indicate potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism and detoxification processes. Genes such as CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics, could be relevant due to the complex chemical environment provided by the molecule.
Step 5: Given the diverse functional groups and the potential for interaction with multiple protein targets, the molecule could be related to several genes. However, based on the detailed analysis, the most likely candidates include ABCB1, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, and HTR2B.
