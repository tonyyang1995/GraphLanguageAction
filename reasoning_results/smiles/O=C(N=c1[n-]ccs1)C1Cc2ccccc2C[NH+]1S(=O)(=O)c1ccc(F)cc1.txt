Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(N=c1[n-]ccs1)C1Cc2ccccc2C[NH+]1S(=O)(=O)c1ccc(F)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring (imidazole) linked to a sulfur-containing heterocyclic ring (thiazole), which is characteristic of molecules that can interact with various G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are known to be involved in the regulation of neurotransmission and hormone secretion.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-CONH-) and a carbonyl group (C=O) suggests potential interactions with enzymes such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, which are involved in drug metabolism. Specifically, the CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 enzymes are known to metabolize drugs through oxidation reactions involving these functional groups.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a quinolone-like structure, which could potentially interact with DNA topoisomerases, such as those targeted by the EGFR inhibitors. However, this feature alone does not directly indicate a strong relationship with any of the listed genes.
Step 4: Given the presence of multiple functional groups, including aromatic rings, amine groups, and sulfur-containing heterocycles, this molecule could have diverse interactions with various proteins. For example, it might bind to receptors like the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4) due to its amine functionality, or to adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) due to its aromatic nature.
Step 5: Considering the molecule’s potential to interact with receptors and enzymes, the related genes include those encoding for GPCRs (e.g., CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) and enzymes involved in drug metabolism (e.g., CYP2D6, CYP2C19).
Summary of Related Genes:
- GPCRs: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- Drug Metabolism Enzymes: CYP2D6, CYP2C19
The molecule is likely to be related to these genes based on its structural features and the biological functions of the encoded proteins. These genes play crucial roles in neurotransmission, hormone regulation, and drug metabolism.
