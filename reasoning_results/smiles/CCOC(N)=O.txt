Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this relationship might be clinically significant.
Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string CCOC(N)=O is identified as a nitroimidazole derivative, which includes a nitrogen atom with a double bond to an oxygen atom (N-O) and an imidazole ring.
Step 2: This structure is reminiscent of molecules known to interact with various receptors and enzymes, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in the molecule suggests potential interactions with enzymes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are known to metabolize compounds containing such groups.
Step 4: The molecule's structure also indicates possible interactions with neurotransmitter receptors, particularly those associated with serotonin, such as HTR2A (serotonin 5-HT2A receptor), given the presence of the imidazole ring, which is a common feature in many serotonin receptor ligands.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and potential interactions, the related genes include CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A.
Summary of related genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A. Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string CCOC(N)=O is identified as a nitroimidazole derivative, featuring a nitrogen atom with a double bond to an oxygen atom (N-O) and an imidazole ring.
