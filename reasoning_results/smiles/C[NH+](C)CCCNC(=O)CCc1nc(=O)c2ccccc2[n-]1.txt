Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+](C)CCCNC(=O)CCc1nc(=O)c2ccccc2[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (N+), indicating it could be an ionizable compound. This feature may interact with receptors that have ion channel or G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) functions.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a carboxyl group (-COOH) and a lactam structure, which are common in compounds that can modulate enzymes or receptors involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways.
Step 3: The presence of multiple aromatic rings suggests the molecule could act as a ligand for receptors or enzymes that recognize such structures, like GPCRs or cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Step 4: Given the potential interactions with ion channels and GPCRs, the molecule might be related to genes encoding such proteins, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 5: Additionally, due to its possible modulation of enzymes like cytochrome P450s, the molecule might also be related to CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
Related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6.
