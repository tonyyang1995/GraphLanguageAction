Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(NCc1ccco1)c1ccc2c(=O)n(-c3ccccc3)c(=S)[n-]c2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains several functional groups including an amide (N=C), a sulfoxide (S=O), and a carboxylic acid (COOH). These functional groups are often involved in interactions with proteins that have binding sites for small molecules, particularly those related to neurotransmission and signal transduction.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the amide group and a carboxylic acid group suggests that this molecule could potentially interact with ion channels, receptors, or enzymes that contain similar functional groups in their active sites. For instance, some G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels have regions that can form hydrogen bonds with amides and carboxylic acids.
Step 3: The sulfoxide group might be relevant for interactions with enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are known to oxidize sulfides and sulfoxides into more reactive forms. This interaction could affect the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of the molecule.
Step 4: Given the potential for interaction with receptors and enzymes, the molecule could influence the activity of several genes involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism. Specifically, it may impact genes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, DRD2, and SLC6A4.
Step 5: The related genes include CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, DRD2, and SLC6A4.
Summary of related genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, DRD2, SLC6A4.
