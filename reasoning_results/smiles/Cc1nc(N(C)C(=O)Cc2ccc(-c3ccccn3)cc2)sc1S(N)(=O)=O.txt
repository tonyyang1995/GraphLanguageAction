Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1nc(N(C)C(=O)Cc2ccc(-c3ccccn3)cc2)sc1S(N)(=O)=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple functional groups such as amide, sulfone, and aromatic rings. These structural features suggest it could interact with proteins that have binding sites for similar chemical moieties.
Step 2: The presence of a sulfone group (-SO2-) in the molecule indicates potential interaction with enzymes or receptors that have sulfur-containing amino acids like cysteine or methionine in their active sites. This feature is relevant to genes encoding enzymes involved in sulfur metabolism or drug metabolism pathways.
Step 3: The amide group (-CONH2) suggests the molecule could act as an agonist or antagonist for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which often bind ligands with amide functionalities. Genes encoding GPCRs such as HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HRH1 are likely candidates for interaction.
Step 4: The aromatic ring structure of the molecule may allow it to interact with DNA-binding proteins or other proteins that recognize specific DNA sequences, which could be relevant to transcription factors or other regulatory proteins encoded by genes like PTGS1.
Step 5: Given the diverse functional groups and overall complexity, this molecule could potentially interact with multiple targets, including those encoded by the listed genes. However, based on the structural analysis, the most likely interactions are with GPCRs (HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HRH1) and enzymes involved in sulfur metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6).
