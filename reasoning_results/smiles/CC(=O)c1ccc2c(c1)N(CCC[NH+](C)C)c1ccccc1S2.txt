Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(=O)c1ccc2c(c1)N(CCC[NH+](C)C)c1ccccc1S2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring system, an amide group, a pyrrole ring, and a sulfur-containing moiety. This structure suggests that it could interact with proteins involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, enzyme activity, and receptor binding.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-CO-NH-) indicates potential interactions with enzymes that contain histidine residues in their active sites, such as CYP2D6 and CYP2C9, which are involved in drug metabolism. The amide group could also serve as a ligand for receptors, particularly those that have a histidine residue in their intracellular regions, like HTR2B (serotonin receptor).
Step 3: The benzene ring and the sulfur-containing moiety suggest possible interactions with proteins involved in calcium signaling, such as CACNA1H, which encodes a voltage-gated calcium channel. Additionally, the overall structure might be recognized by proteins involved in G-protein coupled receptor signaling, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and HRH1.
Step 4: The presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (pyrrole ring) could potentially interact with proteins containing cysteine residues, such as SLC6A2 and SLC6A4, which are involved in neurotransmitter transport.
Step 5: Considering the above structural features, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, HTR2B, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CACNA1H, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4.
