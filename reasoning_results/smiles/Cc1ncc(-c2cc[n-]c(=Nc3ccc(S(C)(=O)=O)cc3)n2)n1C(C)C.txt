Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ncc(-c2cc[n-]c(=Nc3ccc(S(C)(=O)=O)cc3)n2)n1C(C)C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with nitrogen-containing heterocycles, specifically an imidazole ring and a pyrrole ring. These structural features are often associated with compounds that interact with receptors and transport proteins.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) suggests potential interactions with enzymes such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) family members, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a quinolone-like structure, which may indicate potential binding to receptors like G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly those involved in neurotransmission and hormone signaling.
Step 4: Considering the molecular structure and functional groups, the molecule could potentially interact with genes encoding for CYP enzymes (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), GPCRs (e.g., DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), and transporters (e.g., SLC6A2, SLC6A4).
Step 5: The related gene names are: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, SLC6A2, SLC6A4. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with nitrogen-containing heterocycles, specifically an imidazole ring and a pyrrole ring. These structural features are often associated with compounds that interact with receptors and transport proteins.
Step 5: The related gene names are: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, SLC6A2, SLC
