Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N=c1[n-]ccc(Oc2ccc(NC(=O)c3c[n-]cc(-c4ccc(F)cc4)c3=O)cc2F)c1Cl, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a negative charge and a phenyl ring system, suggesting it may interact with receptors that have affinity for basic amino groups or aromatic compounds.
Step 2: The presence of a furan ring (Oc2ccc(NC(=O)c3c[n-]cc(-c4ccc(F)cc4)c3=O)) indicates potential interactions with enzymes or transporters that metabolize or transport aromatic compounds.
Step 3: The molecule has a complex structure including multiple functional groups such as amides, esters, and fluorine substituents, which could influence its binding to proteins involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 4: The overall structure hints at possible interactions with enzymes or receptors involved in neurotransmitter metabolism or signaling, given the presence of amide and ester bonds.
Step 5: Based on the structural features, the molecule might be related to genes involved in neurotransmitter systems, such as DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Summary of related gene names: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
