Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1cc(-c2ccccc2)[n-]n1-c1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule is a complex organic compound that includes a benzene ring system, a cyano group (-CN), and an amide group (-CONH). These structural elements suggest the molecule may interact with proteins involved in signaling pathways or enzyme activities.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group and amide functional groups is particularly relevant for enzymes such as CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize compounds containing these functional groups. This indicates potential interactions between the molecule and these enzymes.
Step 3: The amide group could also interact with receptors, especially those involved in neurotransmission, such as HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A) and DRD2 (dopamine receptor 2). These receptors have amine binding sites that might accommodate the amide group.
Step 4: Given the overall complexity and specific functional groups, the molecule could potentially influence multiple genes involved in various pathways, including but not limited to, those encoding enzymes (CYP2C19, CYP2D6) and receptors (HTR2A, DRD2).
Step 5: Therefore, the related genes to this molecule include: CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A, and DRD2.
Summary of related genes: CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A, DRD2.
