Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ncc(CO)c(C[NH3+])c1[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string Cc1ncc(CO)c(C[NH3+])c1[O-] contains a benzene ring with a nitrogen atom bearing a positive charge and an oxygen-containing substituent. This pattern suggests that the molecule is likely an alkaloid or a related compound, which often interacts with receptors and ion channels involved in neurotransmission.
Step 2: The presence of a positively charged nitrogen and a benzene ring indicates potential interactions with proteins that have similar structural motifs. Such proteins include receptors like adrenergic (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and cholinergic (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4) receptors, which are known to bind to small molecules with similar structures.
Step 3: The oxygen-containing substituent could also interact with enzymes involved in metabolism. For example, cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) are known to metabolize compounds with oxygenated functional groups.
Step 4: Given the overall structure and charge distribution, the molecule may also influence ion channels, particularly those involved in calcium (CACNA1H) and potassium (KCNH2) signaling, which are relevant for neuronal activity and function.
Step 5: Based on the structure and potential interactions, the most likely related genes are those involved in neurotransmission, receptor binding, and metabolism. These include:
- ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2 (adrenergic receptors)
- CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4 (cholinergic receptors)
- CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 (cytochrome P450 enzymes)
- CACNA1H (calcium channel)
- KCNH2 (potassium channel)
Summary of related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CACNA1H, KCNH2.
