Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc2[nH]cc(CCNC(=O)Nc3ccccc3)c2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with several aromatic rings, including a pyrrole ring, a pyridine ring, and a benzene ring. Additionally, it contains a nitrogen atom that is potentially capable of forming hydrogen bonds, which could interact with certain receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: Considering the structure, this molecule might be designed to interact with receptors or enzymes that have similar chemical features, such as nitrogen-containing heterocycles and aromatic rings. One such receptor is the Dopamine D2-like receptor (DRD2), which includes DRD3 and DRD4, all of which are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) known for binding small molecules with aromatic and nitrogenous functionalities.
Step 3: Another potential interaction could be with the enzyme CYP2D6, which is involved in the metabolism of many drugs and endogenous compounds. CYP2D6 is known to metabolize molecules containing aromatic rings and nitrogen atoms, suggesting that our molecule could be a substrate for this enzyme.
Step 4: Given the presence of a pyrrole ring and a nitrogen atom, the molecule may also interact with ion channels or transporters. For example, KCNH2 encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel that may be influenced by molecules with planar structures and polar functional groups like the nitrogen atom.
Step 5: Based on the structure and potential interactions, the related genes include: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2D6, and KCNH2.
Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2
- DRD3
- DRD4
- CYP2D6
- KCNH2 Step 5: Summary of related gene names:
- KCNH2
These genes are likely to be influenced by the molecule due to its structural features and potential interactions with these proteins.
