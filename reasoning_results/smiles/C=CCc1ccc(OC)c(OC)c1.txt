Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C=CCc1ccc(OC)c(OC)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string C=CCc1ccc(OC)c(OC)c1 has a benzene ring (C=CC) with two cyclohexane rings attached to it, each containing an oxygen atom (OC). This structure suggests that the molecule could interact with proteins involved in cell signaling pathways, such as receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The cyclohexane rings with oxygen atoms (OC) indicate potential for hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. These types of interactions are common in ligand-receptor binding, where hydrogen bonds can stabilize the binding complex, and hydrophobic interactions can help in the formation of the complex.
Step 3: Given the structure, the molecule might be able to bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which often have binding sites for small molecules due to their hydrophobic pocket and the presence of conserved amino acid residues like tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine. The cyclohexane rings and the oxygen atoms could fit into such a pocket.
Step 4: Among the listed genes, several are known to code for GPCRs, including CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4. These genes encode muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and dopamine receptors, respectively, which are GPCRs involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule's structure could also potentially interact with enzymes such as those coded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism. The presence of functional groups like the carbonyl (C=O) and the aromatic rings suggest that the molecule might serve as a substrate or inhibitor for these enzymes.
Summary of related gene names:
- CHRM1
- CHRM3
- CHRM4
- DRD2
- DRD3
- DRD4
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
These genes are likely to be the most relevant given the molecule's structure and its potential to interact with both GPCRs and enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
