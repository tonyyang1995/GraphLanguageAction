Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1c(NC(=O)c2cc(C(N)=O)nc3cc(F)ccc23)c(C(F)(F)F)nn1Cc1ccc(C#N)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this might be clinically relevant.
Step 1: The molecule contains multiple functional groups such as amide (N-C(=O)-), carboxylic acid (-COOH), and aromatic rings (benzene rings). These functional groups suggest the molecule could interact with proteins that contain binding sites for these structures, such as enzymes or receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring with a cyano group (-C#N) and fluorine atoms (F) indicates the molecule may have affinity for proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, particularly those containing ion channels or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The molecule also includes a quinoline-like structure, which is often found in ligands that bind to GPCRs and other receptor types. This structural feature could indicate potential interactions with receptors such as adrenergic (adrenergic alpha-1D, adrenergic alpha-2B, adrenergic beta-2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M1, M3, M4).
Step 4: Given the complexity of the molecule and its various functional groups, it suggests possible interactions with multiple enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
Step 5: The molecule’s overall structure and functional groups hint at potential interactions with neurotransmitter receptors and transporters, specifically HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and SLC6A2, which are involved in serotonin signaling, and DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are dopamine receptors.
