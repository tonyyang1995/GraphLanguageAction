Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCC[NH+](CCC)C(=O)CSc1nc2ccccc2c(=O)n1CC1COc2ccccc2O1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (NH+), indicating it may be an amine or amide derivative. This functional group can interact with receptors that have ion channels or G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) characteristics.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an ester group (-OC(=O)-). These functional groups are often involved in enzyme inhibition or modulation, particularly for enzymes like CYPs (cytochrome P450) which are known to metabolize drugs and other xenobiotics.
Step 3: The presence of multiple aromatic rings suggests potential interactions with proteins that contain hydrophobic binding sites, such as those found in the cytoskeleton or membrane proteins.
Step 4: Given the complexity of the molecule and its functional groups, it could potentially interact with several genes involved in drug metabolism and receptor signaling, including CYP enzymes, GPCRs, and ion channels.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and functional groups, the related genes are likely to include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
