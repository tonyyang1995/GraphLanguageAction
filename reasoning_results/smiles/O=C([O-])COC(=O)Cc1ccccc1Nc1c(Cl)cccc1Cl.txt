Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])COC(=O)Cc1ccccc1Nc1c(Cl)cccc1Cl, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyridine ring system, which is a common pharmacophore often found in ligands for receptors such as ADRB2 (Adrenergic Receptor Beta 2) and DRD2 (Dopamine Receptor D2), both of which are involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways.
Step 2: The molecule also includes an aromatic ring with a carboxyl group, reminiscent of compounds that may interact with CYP2D6 (Cytochrome P450 2D6), an enzyme involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group and a chlorine atom could indicate potential interactions with PTGS1 (Cyclooxygenase 1), an enzyme involved in prostaglandin synthesis, which is regulated by ESR1 (Estrogen Receptor Alpha).
Step 4: The molecule's overall structure suggests possible interactions with enzymes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which metabolize various drugs, indicating potential effects on drug response and side effects.
Step 5: Given the molecule's structural features, it is likely to have interactions with genes involved in neurotransmission, drug metabolism, and inflammatory responses, including ADRB2, DRD2, CYP2D6, PTGS1, and ESR1.
Summary of related gene names: ADRB2, DRD2, CYP2D6, PTGS1, ESR1.
