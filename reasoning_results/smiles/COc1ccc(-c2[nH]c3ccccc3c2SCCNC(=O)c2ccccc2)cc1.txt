Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(-c2[nH]c3ccccc3c2SCCNC(=O)c2ccccc2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex molecule with multiple functional groups, including a benzene ring, a sulfur-containing group (-S), and a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring. The presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring suggests potential interactions with receptors that have similar functional groups.
Step 2: The molecule contains a quinoline-like structure (quinoline is a common pharmacophore found in many drugs and can interact with various receptors such as adrenergic receptors and G-protein coupled receptors). This structure is often associated with binding to adrenergic receptors, which are encoded by genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule has a pyridine ring attached to a benzene ring, which is another common pharmacophore. Pyridine rings are known to interact with enzymes such as CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH2) in the molecule suggests it may be an inhibitor or activator of enzymes such as HTR2A and HTR2C, which are involved in serotonin signaling and are encoded by the HTR2A and HTR2C genes.
Step 5: Given the diverse functional groups and potential for interaction with multiple receptor and enzyme types, the molecule could be related to several of the listed genes, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A, and HTR2C.
Summary of related gene names:
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- ADRB2
- CHRM1
- CHRM3
- CHRM4
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- HTR2A
- HTR2C
Note: This analysis assumes the molecule has the potential to interact with these genes based on its chemical structure and common pharmacophores. Further experimental validation would be necessary to confirm any actual biological activity or interaction.
