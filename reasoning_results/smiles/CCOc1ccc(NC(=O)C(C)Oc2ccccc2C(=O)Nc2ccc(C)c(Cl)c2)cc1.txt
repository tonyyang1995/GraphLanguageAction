Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C(C)Oc2ccccc2C(=O)Nc2ccc(C)c(Cl)c2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is common in many drugs that interact with receptors or enzymes. This suggests potential interactions with genes encoding membrane receptors or drug-metabolizing enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (N-C(=O)-C) indicates a possible interaction with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C19 and CYP2D6.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a quinoline ring system, which may suggest potential interactions with genes encoding ion channels or receptors, such as KCNH2 and DRD2.
Step 4: The aromatic amine structure could indicate potential interactions with genes involved in neurotransmitter transport or metabolism, such as SLC6A2 and HTR2A.
Step 5: Given the complex structure and potential for multiple interactions, the molecule is likely related to several genes including CYP2C19, CYP2D6, KCNH2, DRD2, SLC6A2, and HTR2A.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2C19, CYP2D6, KCNH2, DRD2, SLC6A2, HTR2A.
