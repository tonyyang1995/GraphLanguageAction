Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N#Cc1nc(COc2ccccc2Cl)oc1NCc1ccco1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a tricyclic structure with a nitrogen atom double-bonded to carbon (N#C), indicating potential interactions with receptors that have similar structural motifs, such as adrenergic receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) and a phenolic group (-OH) suggest the molecule could interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19.
Step 3: The molecule includes a benzene ring with multiple substituents, which may interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), specifically those mentioned in the list such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C.
Step 4: The presence of a quinoline-like structure could indicate potential interactions with ion channels, such as KCNH2.
Step 5: Given the diverse functional groups and the overall structure, the molecule is likely to be related to multiple genes, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, and SLC6A4.
