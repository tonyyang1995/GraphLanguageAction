Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccsc1C(=O)N=c1[n-]ccs1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with a sulfonyl group attached, which is characteristic of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This structural feature suggests potential interactions with genes involved in inflammation and pain modulation.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) and a carboxamide group (-CONH2) indicates the molecule may have inhibitory activity against certain enzymes, such as those involved in neurotransmitter metabolism or signal transduction pathways.
Step 3: The aromatic amine and the carboxylic acid functionalities in the molecule could interact with ion channels, potentially affecting their gating mechanisms. This could be relevant for genes encoding ion channels like KCNH2.
Step 4: The presence of a benzene ring with substituents like the sulfonyl group and the cyano group might also indicate potential interactions with receptors or transporters, particularly those involved in GPCR signaling or drug transport, such as CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and SLC6A4.
Step 5: Given the above structural features, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, CYP1A2, KCNH2, SLC6A4, and possibly ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, PTGS1, and SIGMAR1. These genes are involved in various aspects of pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. Step 1: CYP2D6
Step 2: CYP2C19
Step 3: CYP2C9
Step 4: CYP3A4
Step 5: CYP1A2
Summary List: CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, CYP1A2, KCNH2, SLC6A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, PTGS1, SIGMAR1
