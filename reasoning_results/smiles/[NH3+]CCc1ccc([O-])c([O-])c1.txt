Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [NH3+]CCc1ccc([O-])c([O-])c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is an ammonium salt (NH3+) attached to a benzene ring, which is further connected to a cyclohexene ring with two negatively charged oxygens (-O-) attached. This structure suggests the molecule could have a basic nitrogen atom and acidic oxygen atoms, which are important for interactions with proteins and nucleic acids.
Step 2: Considering the pattern of the molecule, it has potential for binding to proteins that have basic amino acid residues (lysine, arginine, histidine) and acidic residues (aspartic acid, glutamic acid). Proteins with such features include receptors and ion channels, which are known to be involved in signal transduction pathways and neurotransmission.
Step 3: Among the provided genes, several are associated with receptor families or ion channels. For instance, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 all encode for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other receptors involved in neurotransmission. Additionally, CACNA1H encodes for a calcium channel, which is also relevant here due to its role in neuronal signaling.
Step 4: Furthermore, the molecule's basic nature might interact with proteins containing basic amino acid residues, such as those encoded by genes like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which encode dopamine receptors, or PTGS1, which encodes cyclooxygenase-1, an enzyme involved in prostaglandin synthesis and inflammation.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis and the potential for interaction with basic and acidic residues, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CACNA1H, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, ESR1, PTGS1.
Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CACNA1H, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, ESR1, PTGS1.
