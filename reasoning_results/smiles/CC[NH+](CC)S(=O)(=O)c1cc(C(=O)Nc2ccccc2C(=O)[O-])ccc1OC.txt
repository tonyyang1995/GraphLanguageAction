Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC[NH+](CC)S(=O)(=O)c1cc(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2C(=O)[O-])ccc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure including an amine group (-NH+) that can form hydrogen bonds, a sulfonate ester (S(=O)(=O)) which can interact with proteins through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, and a phenolic hydroxyl group (OC) that can participate in hydrogen bonding. These functional groups suggest the molecule could have potential interactions with proteins that have similar functional groups or binding sites.
Step 2: Considering the genes provided, those involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways are of particular interest due to their extensive use of hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions for ligand binding. This includes genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes encode receptors that often have ligand-binding domains rich in hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, which aligns with the molecule's functional groups.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a carboxylic acid group (C(=O)N), which can engage in hydrogen bonding and ion-dipole interactions. Genes encoding enzymes like CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are involved in phase I drug metabolism, might have interactions with this functional group. These enzymes often bind substrates via hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a thioether group (S(=O)(=O)) suggests possible interactions with proteins containing cysteine residues, which are common in many enzymes. Genes such as CYP3A4 and CYP1A2, which are involved in xenobiotic metabolism, might have specific cysteine-rich regions where the thioether group could interact.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule could be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP1A2. These genes are involved in various biological processes, including neurotransmission and drug metabolism, which are areas where the molecule's functional groups could play a role.
