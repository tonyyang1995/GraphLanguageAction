Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1c2ccccc2nc2n1CCc1c-2[nH]c2ccccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a quinoline ring system, which is a common pharmacophore for many ligands that interact with receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B) and dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4). This structural feature suggests potential interactions with these receptor types.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and a cyano group (-CN) indicates the molecule may have affinity for enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2D6 and CYP2C9, which are known to metabolize compounds containing these functional groups.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a pyrrolidine ring, which can be involved in forming hydrogen bonds and stabilizing interactions with proteins, particularly with cholinergic receptors like CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 4: The overall structure, including the presence of aromatic rings and heteroatoms, might suggest the molecule could interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are characterized by seven transmembrane domains.
Step 5: The molecule’s structure does not directly indicate significant interactions with other genes listed, such as those involved in signal transduction pathways, kinases, or inflammatory responses.
Summary of related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
