Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC[NH+](CC)S(=O)(=O)c1ccc(NC(=O)c2cc(-c3cccs3)nc3ccccc23)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex molecule that includes a nitrogen atom bearing a positive charge (N+), a sulfur atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom (S=O), and a benzene ring with multiple substituents. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in neurotransmission, signaling pathways, and drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a positively charged nitrogen atom (N+) and a sulfonate group (S=O) indicates that this molecule could be a ligand for receptors or enzymes involved in signal transduction. This feature aligns with the presence of several G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other signaling pathway-related genes in the given list.
Step 3: Notably, the molecule contains a benzene ring, which is a common feature in many ligands that interact with receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4). These receptors are known to bind to various ligands containing aromatic rings.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure might allow it to interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are cytochrome P450 enzymes responsible for metabolizing numerous drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4.
Summary of related gene names:
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- ADRB2
- CHRM1
- CHRM3
- CHRM4
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP3A4
