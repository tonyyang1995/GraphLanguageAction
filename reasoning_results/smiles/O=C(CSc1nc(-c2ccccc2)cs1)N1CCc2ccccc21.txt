Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(CSc1nc(-c2ccccc2)cs1)N1CCc2ccccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this might be clinically relevant.
Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound with a structure that includes a benzene ring, a cyano group (-CN), and a nitro group (-NO2). These functional groups suggest the molecule could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction or enzymatic processes.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group and a nitro group indicates potential for forming hydrogen bonds or electrostatic interactions with amino acid residues in protein binding sites, particularly those containing polar or charged residues.
Step 3: The benzene ring suggests aromaticity, which could enable the molecule to form π-π stacking interactions with aromatic amino acids such as tyrosine or phenylalanine in protein binding sites.
Step 4: Considering the molecular structure, the molecule may interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to its size and the presence of polar and aromatic groups, which are common features of GPCR ligands.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and potential interactions, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HRH1, KDR, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, and PTGS1. These genes encode proteins involved in neurotransmission, hormone signaling, and other cellular processes that could be modulated by the described molecule.
