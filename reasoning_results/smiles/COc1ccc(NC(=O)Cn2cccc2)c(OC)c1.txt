Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(NC(=O)Cn2cccc2)c(OC)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound that includes a benzene ring system, a nitrogen-containing heterocycle, and an amide group. The presence of these structural elements suggests potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for similar chemical moieties.
Step 2: Among the listed genes, several are known to encode receptors or enzymes that interact with various types of ligands, including those containing aromatic rings, nitrogen-containing groups, and amide functionalities. These include CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics and drugs through hydroxylation and oxidation reactions.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule’s structure could potentially bind to ion channels or receptors such as HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A), which has a binding site for serotonin and other small molecules. This makes HTR2A another candidate for interaction.
Step 4: Furthermore, the presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocycle and an amide group might also suggest possible interactions with enzymes like ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein), which is involved in drug efflux and can be modulated by certain compounds.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and the functional roles of the listed genes, the related genes that this molecule might interact with include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, and ABCB1. 
Summary of Related Genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, ABCB1.
