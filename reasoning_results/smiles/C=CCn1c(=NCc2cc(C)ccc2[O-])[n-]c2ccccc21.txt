Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C=CCn1c(=NCc2cc(C)ccc2[O-])[n-]c2ccccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples or additional unnecessary text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with a nitrogen atom double-bonded to a carbon atom, which is part of a nitrile group (-CN). This structural feature is characteristic of molecules that can interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2D6, which metabolizes many drugs including those containing nitrile groups.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a pyridine ring, which can form hydrogen bonds and is known to interact with various receptors such as adrenergic and cholinergic receptors. This structural element is relevant to genes encoding these receptors, specifically ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of an oxygen atom in the molecule, specifically in the form of an ester or ether, suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in lipid metabolism and signaling pathways. This is pertinent to the gene CYP2C9, which plays a role in the metabolism of some drugs.
Step 4: The molecule’s overall structure, with multiple functional groups and rings, indicates it could be a substrate for drug transporters, particularly P-glycoprotein (ABCB1), which is encoded by the ABCB1 gene. This transporter is known to efflux drugs from cells, affecting their intracellular concentration.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related genes include: ABCB1, CYP2D6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and CYP2C9. These genes are involved in drug metabolism, receptor binding, and transport processes, which are directly influenced by the molecule's chemical structure. 
Summary of Related Genes: ABCB1, CYP2D6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9.
