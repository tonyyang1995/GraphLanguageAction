Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COC(=O)c1ccccc1NC(=O)C1CC[NH+](C(=O)c2ccc(OC)cc2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is common in many drug molecules that interact with receptors and enzymes. This structural feature could potentially interact with proteins encoded by genes involved in signal transduction pathways and drug metabolism.
Step 2: The molecule includes a pyrrolidine ring and amide groups, which are known to form hydrogen bonds and participate in enzyme binding. This suggests potential interactions with enzymes such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH-) indicates a possible interaction with ion channels or receptors. Genes like KCNH2 (encoding a potassium channel) and HTR2A (encoding a serotonin receptor) might be related due to their involvement in neuronal signaling.
Step 4: The molecule also has a phenyl ring and an amine group, which could interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Genes such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which encode dopamine receptors, could be relevant because they play key roles in neurotransmission.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and functional groups, the molecule may have multiple points of interaction with various genes. However, based on the specific features identified, the most likely related genes are CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, KCNH2, HTR2A, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
Summary of Related Gene Names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, KCNH2, HTR2A, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
