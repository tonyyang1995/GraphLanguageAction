Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+](c1nc(=O)cc[n-]1)C1CCN(c2nc3ccccc3n2Cc2ccc(F)cc2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple functional groups such as amine, carboxylic acid, and aromatic rings. This complexity suggests it could interact with various biological targets. However, the presence of a positively charged nitrogen (NH+) indicates that this molecule might be a cationic compound.
Step 2: The positively charged nitrogen in the molecule could potentially interact with anionic sites on proteins, which are often involved in ion channels or receptors. For instance, this interaction could occur with receptors that have negatively charged regions, such as those found in the adrenergic and cholinergic systems.
Step 3: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is common in many drugs that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Specific genes encoding GPCRs include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, which are all involved in neurotransmission and hormone signaling.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a fluorine atom (-F) in the molecule might suggest it could be a ligand for certain enzymes or receptors known to interact with fluorinated compounds, such as some members of the cytochrome P450 family (CYP2C19, CYP2D6), which metabolize numerous drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 5: Given the structural features and potential interactions described, the molecule is most likely related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C19, CYP2D6. These genes encode proteins that could directly or indirectly interact with the molecule due to its functional groups and overall structure. 
Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C19, CYP2D6.
