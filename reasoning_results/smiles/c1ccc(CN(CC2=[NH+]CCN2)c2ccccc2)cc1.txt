Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: c1ccc(CN(CC2=[NH+]CCN2)c2ccccc2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that includes a cyclic structure with nitrogen atoms, which are often involved in binding to proteins such as receptors and enzymes. This cyclic structure, along with the presence of nitrogen and carbon atoms, suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in signaling pathways and metabolic processes.
Step 2: Notably, the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) and an amide group (-CONH-), which are functional groups that can participate in hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions with proteins. These types of interactions are particularly relevant for ligands that bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are known to be involved in numerous physiological processes mediated by neurotransmitters and hormones.
Step 3: Given the pattern of the molecule and its functional groups, it is likely to interact with GPCRs. Among the provided genes, several are known to encode for GPCRs: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes are associated with various neurotransmitter systems, including adrenergic and cholinergic systems, as well as serotonin receptors.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a nitrogen-containing ring in the molecule, along with other functional groups, could suggest potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism. This might include CYP enzymes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are known to be involved in the metabolism of many drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 5: Based on the structural and functional characteristics of the molecule, the related genes can be summarized as follows:
- GPCRs: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- Metabolic enzymes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6
Summary of related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6.
