Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(C[NH+]1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O)N1c2ccccc2CCc2ccccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a quinolone-like structure with a pyridine ring fused to a benzene ring, which is characteristic of certain ligands for adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2). This structural feature suggests potential interaction with adrenergic receptor pathways.
Step 2: Additionally, the presence of a phenyl ring and amide group may indicate a possible interaction with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are involved in drug metabolism and could influence the pharmacokinetics of the molecule.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a pyrrolidine ring, which is known to interact with G-protein coupled receptors such as serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), potentially affecting their function.
Step 4: Furthermore, the presence of a carbamate group might suggest an interaction with cholinergic receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), given that these receptors often bind to similar functional groups.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4.
