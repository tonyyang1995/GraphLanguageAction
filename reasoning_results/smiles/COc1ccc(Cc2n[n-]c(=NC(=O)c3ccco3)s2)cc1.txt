Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(Cc2n[n-]c(=NC(=O)c3ccco3)s2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound with a benzene ring, a nitro group (-NO2), and a pyrrole ring fused to it. The presence of a nitro group and the overall structure suggest potential interactions with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways and receptor binding.
Step 2: The molecule contains a cytosine moiety (C), which is often found in nucleic acids and can interact with DNA-binding proteins. Additionally, the presence of an amide group (-CONH-) indicates potential for binding to enzymes or receptors that have amine groups as their active sites.
Step 3: The nitro group (-NO2) on the molecule could act as a functional group that might interact with proteins containing aromatic residues, such as those involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways. This is relevant to genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which encode for various types of adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors.
Step 4: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) suggests potential for interaction with proteins that bind acidic moieties, such as ion channels. For instance, KCNH2 encodes for a potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2, which could be a target for this molecule.
Step 5: The overall structure of the molecule, particularly the nitro group and carboxylic acid, may also interact with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize drugs and xenobiotics.
