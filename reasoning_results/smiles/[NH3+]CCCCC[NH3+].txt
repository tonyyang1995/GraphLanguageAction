Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [NH3+]CCCCC[NH3+], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The SMILES string [NH3+]CCCCC[NH3+] describes a linear alkylamine structure with a positively charged amine group at both ends. This type of molecule is known to interact with ion channels and receptors that have specific binding sites for amino groups.
Step 2: Analyzing the gene features, we find that several genes are involved in encoding ion channels or receptors that could potentially bind to this alkylamine molecule. These include CACNA1H (a calcium channel), KCNH2 (a potassium channel), and HRH1 (a histamine receptor).
Step 3: The molecule also has potential interactions with neurotransmitter receptors due to its amine functionality. Genes encoding such receptors include HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 (serotonin receptors) and CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4 (acetylcholine receptors).
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule might influence enzymes that metabolize drugs, as it contains an amine group which could interact with drug-metabolizing enzymes like CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names: CACNA1H, KCNH2, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6. These genes encode proteins that could directly interact with or be influenced by the given molecule. The related gene list includes ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors, and drug-metabolizing enzymes. 
Summary of related genes: CACNA1H, KCNH2, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6.
