Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cn1c(=O)c(Oc2cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c2)nc2ccccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule, identified by the SMILES string Cn1c(=O)c(Oc2cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c2)nc2ccccc21, is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring system, a nitrile group (-CN), and an amide group (-CONH-). This structure suggests that the molecule could potentially interact with proteins involved in cellular signaling and metabolism.
Step 2: Analyzing the genes provided, we look for those involved in pathways related to drug metabolism and receptor functions, as these are likely to be influenced by the chemical structure of the molecule. Genes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 are associated with cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are crucial for metabolizing drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: Additionally, genes like DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2) and HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A) are related to neurotransmitter receptors, which could be targeted by molecules with structural features similar to the amide and nitrile groups present in the molecule.
Step 4: The presence of halogen atoms (chlorine) in the molecule might also suggest interactions with transporters or ion channels, such as those encoded by SLC6A2 and SLC6A4, which are involved in the uptake of neurotransmitters and other small molecules.
Step 5: Considering the above points, the related genes to this molecule include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4. These genes encode proteins that could potentially interact with or be affected by the molecule due to its structural features. 
Summary of Related Genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
