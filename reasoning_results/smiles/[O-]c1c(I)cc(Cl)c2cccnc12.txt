Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [O-]c1c(I)cc(Cl)c2cccnc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a molecule with a negatively charged oxygen atom (O-) at one end and a complex aromatic ring system at the other, which includes chlorine (Cl) and iodine (I). This structure suggests the molecule could have potential interactions with proteins that are involved in transport or metabolism due to its charged and aromatic nature.
Step 2: The aromatic ring system and the presence of chlorine and iodine suggest the molecule might interact with enzymes or receptors that are known to bind to such functional groups. For instance, it could potentially affect enzymes involved in drug metabolism like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, or transporters like ABCB1.
Step 3: The negatively charged oxygen group (-O-) indicates the molecule may have affinity for ion channels or receptors that are sensitive to changes in ionic environment or pH. Genes encoding such proteins include KCNH2 (potassium channel subfamily H member 2), which is an important potassium channel involved in cardiac repolarization, and possibly others like CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4, which encode muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.
Step 4: Given the complexity and specific functional groups present, the molecule could also interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are involved in various physiological processes. Relevant genes here include HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which encode serotonin receptors, and DRD2, which encodes dopamine receptor D2.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and the outlined interactions, the related genes are likely to be: ABCB1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, KCNH2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and DRD2. These genes are involved in drug metabolism, ion channel function, and neurotransmission, respectively.
