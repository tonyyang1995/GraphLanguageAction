Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1c([O-])c(-c2ccc([O-])c([O-])c2)oc2cc([O-])cc([O-])c12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex molecule that includes multiple functional groups such as carbonyl (C=O), ester (-COOR), and aromatic rings. Notably, the molecule contains several hydroxyl (-OH) and carboxyl (-COO-) groups, which are common in many bioactive compounds.
Step 2: Given the presence of carboxylic acid groups (-COOH) and esters, this molecule likely has acidic or amphipathic properties, which could influence its interaction with cell membrane proteins or ion channels. The aromatic ring structures suggest potential interactions with nuclear receptors or enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 3: Considering the presence of hydroxyl groups and carboxyl groups, this molecule might have affinity for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) or other receptors that bind small molecules. Specifically, the molecule's structure aligns well with the ligand-binding domains of certain GPCRs.
Step 4: Based on the chemical structure, the molecule may interact with receptors and enzymes listed under the categories of neurotransmitters, hormones, and signaling molecules. This includes GPCRs like DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), HTR1A (Serotonin receptor 1A), and CHRM1 (Cholinergic receptor, muscarinic).
Step 5: Therefore, the molecule is potentially related to the following genes: DRD2, HTR1A, and CHRM1. These genes encode receptors that are known to be activated by various small molecules and are involved in neurotransmission and hormone signaling pathways. 
Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2
- HTR1A
- CHRM1 Step 5: Summary of related gene names:
- CHRM1
These genes encode receptors that interact with small molecules similar to the described molecule, suggesting potential pharmacological activity.
