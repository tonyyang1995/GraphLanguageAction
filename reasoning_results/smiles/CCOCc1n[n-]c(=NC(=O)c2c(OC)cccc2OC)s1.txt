Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOCc1n[n-]c(=NC(=O)c2c(OC)cccc2OC)s1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups including an amide (N-C=O), an ester (O-C-O), a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH), and a nitro group (-NO2). The presence of these functional groups suggests that the molecule could potentially interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism or receptors that bind small molecules.
Step 2: Among the provided genes, those encoding for enzymes involved in drug metabolism such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 are particularly relevant. These genes encode cytochrome P450 enzymes which are responsible for metabolizing many drugs and xenobiotics, and their activity can be influenced by structural features of the molecule like those present here.
Step 3: Additionally, several genes encode receptors that might interact directly or indirectly with this molecule. For example, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 all encode G-protein coupled receptors which can bind to various ligands. The presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group and an amide in the molecule could allow it to act as a potential agonist or antagonist for these receptors.
Step 4: Furthermore, the nitro group in the molecule could indicate potential electrophilic reactivity, which might influence interactions with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, such as PTGS1 (encoding cyclooxygenase-1), which is involved in prostaglandin synthesis, and KDR (encoding VEGF receptor-2), which plays a role in angiogenesis.
Step 5: Based on the analysis of the molecule's structure and its potential interactions, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, PTGS1, and KDR.
