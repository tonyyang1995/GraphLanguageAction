Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccccc1N1CC[NH+](CCN(C(=O)C2CCCCC2)c2ccccn2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule containing several functional groups including aromatic rings, amine, amide, and nitro groups. This molecule has a central benzene ring with multiple substituents, which suggests it could interact with proteins that bind to aromatic structures or have specific binding sites for nitrogen-containing moieties.
Step 2: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) and an amide (-CONH-) indicates potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, which are known to metabolize drugs containing these functional groups. CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are particularly relevant here due to their roles in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The molecule also contains an amine group (-NH-), which could potentially interact with receptors that bind to amines. Among the listed genes, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4 encode dopamine receptors, which are known to bind amines and could be targeted by this molecule.
Step 4: Given the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in the structure, the molecule might interact with proteins that bind to acidic moieties. PTGS1 encodes COX-1, an enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of prostaglandins, which could interact with this part of the molecule.
Step 5: The overall structure and functional groups suggest that this molecule could interact with multiple targets, but the most likely related genes based on the provided information are those involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6), neurotransmitter receptor binding (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), and prostaglandin synthesis (PTGS1).
