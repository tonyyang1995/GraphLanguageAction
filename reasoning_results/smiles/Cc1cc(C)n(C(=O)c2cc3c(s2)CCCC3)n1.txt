Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc(C)n(C(=O)c2cc3c(s2)CCCC3)n1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a cyano group (-CN), a carboxamide group (-CONH2), and a pyrrolidine ring fused to the benzene ring. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins that have similar chemical moieties or functional groups.
Step 2: Looking at the genes listed, several are involved in drug metabolism or receptor functions, which could interact with a molecule containing a benzene ring and a carboxamide group. For instance, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 are enzymes involved in phase I drug metabolism, particularly in the oxidation of aromatic compounds and amides.
Step 3: The molecule also has a quinoline-like structure, which might interact with receptors such as HTR2A (serotonin 5-HT2A receptor) and HTR2B (serotonin 5-HT2B receptor). These receptors are known to bind to various ligands including some with quinoline-like structures.
Step 4: Furthermore, the presence of a cyano group could potentially interact with ion channels like KCNH2 (hERG potassium channel) or other proteins with similar binding sites.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to genes involved in drug metabolism (CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4) and serotonin receptor function (HTR2A, HTR2B).
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2D6
- CYP2C9
- CYP3A4
- HTR2A
- HTR2B Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a cyano group (-CN), a carboxamide group (-CONH2), and a pyrrolidine ring fused to the benzene ring. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins that have similar chemical moieties or functional groups.
Step 2: Several genes listed are involved in drug metabolism, specifically CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4, which are enzymes that oxidize aromatic compounds and amides. The presence of these functional groups in the molecule makes it likely to interact with these enzymes.
Step 3: The molecule's quinoline-like structure may interact with serotonin receptors, such as HTR2A and HTR2B, which are known to bind to ligands with similar chemical features.
Step 4: The cyano group in the molecule could interact with ion channels, such as KCNH2 (hERG potassium channel), which might explain its potential interaction with this gene.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure, the molecule is most likely related to genes involved in drug metabolism (CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4) and serotonin receptor function (HTR2A, HTR2B).
- HTR2B
These genes are primarily involved in drug metabolism and serotonin receptor function, making them the most relevant to the given molecule based on its structure. Other genes listed do not have a direct structural or functional relationship with the molecule.
