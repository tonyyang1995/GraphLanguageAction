Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Nc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)N=c2cccc[n-]2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex molecule with multiple functional groups including a sulfur dioxide (SO2) group and an imidazole ring. The sulfur dioxide group is likely to be involved in covalent binding to proteins, which could potentially affect enzymes or receptors that have sulfhydryl (-SH) groups.
Step 2: The imidazole ring in the molecule might interact with basic residues in proteins such as histidine (His), which are common in many enzyme active sites and receptor binding pockets. This interaction could modulate the activity of proteins containing His residues.
Step 3: Given the presence of a nitrogen atom within the imidazole ring, it could form hydrogen bonds with acidic residues like glutamic acid (Glu) or aspartic acid (Asp), which are also common in protein binding sites. This interaction could influence the binding affinity of the molecule to proteins with these residues.
Step 4: Considering the overall structure, the molecule could interact with enzymes and receptors involved in signal transduction pathways, neurotransmitter metabolism, and drug metabolism due to its potential to bind to and modify the activity of these proteins.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and interactions described, the molecule may be related to several genes involved in neurotransmitter signaling, receptor function, and drug metabolism. Specifically, it could be related to: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, PTGS1, OPKR1, and PPARG.
