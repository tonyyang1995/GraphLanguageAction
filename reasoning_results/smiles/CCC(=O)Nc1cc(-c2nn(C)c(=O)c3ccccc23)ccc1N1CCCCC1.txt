Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is part of the core structure of several neurotransmitter receptors and enzymes. This suggests potential interactions with genes involved in neurotransmission and metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a pyrrole ring in the molecule indicates possible binding to proteins that interact with cyclic nucleotides, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This could relate to genes like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which encode dopamine receptors.
Step 3: The molecule includes an amide group (-CONH-) which may interact with enzymes containing similar functional groups, such as CYP2D6, known for its role in drug metabolism.
Step 4: The presence of multiple aromatic rings and nitrogen-containing heterocycles suggests potential interactions with genes encoding ion channels and transporters, like KCNH2 and SLC6A4.
Step 5: Given the complex structure and the presence of various functional groups, this molecule is likely to be related to multiple genes involved in neurotransmission, metabolism, and signaling pathways.
