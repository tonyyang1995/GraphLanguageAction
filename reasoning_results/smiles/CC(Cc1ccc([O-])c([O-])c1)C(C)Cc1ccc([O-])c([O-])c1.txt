Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(Cc1ccc([O-])c([O-])c1)C(C)Cc1ccc([O-])c([O-])c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule has an overall structure that includes multiple rings, particularly benzene rings and a pyrrole ring. This complex structure suggests the molecule could interact with proteins that have similar chemical properties, such as receptors or transporters.
Step 2: Upon closer inspection, the molecule contains several negatively charged groups (-O-) which might indicate it can bind to ion channels or receptors that are sensitive to charge, such as potassium channels or G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The presence of aromatic rings and the overall size of the molecule suggest it could potentially interact with large protein targets like those found in the GPCR family, which include genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes encode for various subtypes of adrenergic and serotonergic receptors.
Step 4: Given the molecule's structure, it may also have potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are known to be involved in drug metabolism.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and potential interaction sites, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4. These genes encode for receptors and enzymes that might be affected by the molecule due to its chemical structure and charge distribution. 
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4.
