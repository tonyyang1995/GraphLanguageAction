Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC[NH+](CC)C(=O)C1(c2ccccc2)CC1C[NH3+], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (N+), indicating it is an amine with a protonated amine group. This structural feature is relevant to receptors that bind to small molecules, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a carboxylate group (-COOH), which can form hydrogen bonds and contribute to binding interactions with proteins, particularly those involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 3: The cyclic structures present, such as the benzene rings and the six-membered ring, suggest potential interactions with proteins containing aromatic amino acid residues or hydrophobic pockets.
Step 4: Given the presence of a benzene ring and the overall structure, this molecule could interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are part of the cytochrome P450 family.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule might have affinity for GPCRs like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are known to interact with ligands that contain basic functional groups, similar to the positively charged nitrogen in the molecule.
