Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(-c2cc(=O)oc3cc4occ(C)c4cc23)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex molecule that includes a benzene ring system, a quinoline-like structure, and several functional groups such as an amide (-CO-NH-), a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH). This structure suggests potential interactions with receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylic acid and amide functional groups in the molecule could indicate its role in modulating neurotransmitter systems. For instance, these functional groups are often found in drugs that interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) which are known to be influenced by various neurotransmitters. Examples of such receptors include HTR2A (serotonin receptor) and DRD2 (dopamine receptor).
Step 3: Additionally, the benzene rings and aromatic substituents in the molecule might suggest it could bind to or interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) like CYP2D6, which metabolize many drugs and endogenous compounds. The molecule’s structure also hints at possible binding to calcium channels (e.g., CACNA1H) due to its aromatic nature and potential for forming hydrogen bonds.
Step 4: The quinoline-like structure and carboxylic acid group could also point towards interactions with kinases, such as LCK (Lck tyrosine kinase), which plays a role in cell signaling pathways. The molecule’s ability to interact with kinases could influence cellular processes mediated by these proteins.
Step 5: Based on the structural features described, the molecule is likely to have relationships with the following genes: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, HTR2A, DRD2, LCK, and CACNA1H.

- CYP2D6
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP3A4
- HTR2A
- DRD2
- LCK
