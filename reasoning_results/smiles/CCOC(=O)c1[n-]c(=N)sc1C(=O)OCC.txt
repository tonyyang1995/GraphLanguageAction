Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)c1[n-]c(=N)sc1C(=O)OCC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a structure that includes a benzene ring, an amide group (-CONH2), and a cyclic amine (-N+), which suggests it could be a drug-like compound with potential pharmacological activity. This structure indicates the molecule might interact with proteins involved in neurotransmission or other biological processes.
Step 2: Analyzing the molecular structure further, we observe the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an ester group (-OCO-) which are common in molecules that can bind to or inhibit enzymes such as those involved in drug metabolism. This suggests the molecule may interact with genes encoding enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs.
Step 3: The cyclic amine part of the molecule, which contains a positively charged nitrogen atom, can act as a ligand for receptors. This indicates the molecule could potentially interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are known to be involved in various neurological functions and responses to neurotransmitters.
Step 4: Given the presence of a benzene ring and amide groups, the molecule could also interact with ion channels and transporters. This implies possible interactions with genes like KCNH2, which encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel, and SLC6A4, which codes for a sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule is likely to have relationships with the following genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, KCNH2, and SLC6A4. These genes are involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmission, and ion channel function, which aligns with the structural characteristics of the molecule.
