Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCC(CC)c1n[n-]c(=NC(=O)c2ccc3ccccc3n2)s1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex molecule that includes a benzene ring system, a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (indole), and a sulfonamide group. This structure suggests the molecule could be a drug-like compound, potentially acting as an inhibitor or modulator of certain enzymes or receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring and the presence of a sulfonamide group are common in drugs that target G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms. The pattern of the molecule, with its aromatic and heterocyclic components, aligns with the binding sites of many CYP enzymes, particularly those involved in phase I metabolism.
Step 3: Considering the gene list provided, several genes encode proteins that are known targets for compounds with similar structural features. Specifically, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 are all members of the CYP family and are involved in the metabolism of various drugs. The molecule's potential to interact with these enzymes is significant.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocycle might suggest the molecule could interact with GPCRs. Genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4 encode GPCRs, which are often targeted by drugs due to their role in neurotransmission and other physiological processes.
Step 5: In summary, based on the molecular structure, the molecule is likely to be related to the genes encoding CYP enzymes (CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and GPCRs (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4).
