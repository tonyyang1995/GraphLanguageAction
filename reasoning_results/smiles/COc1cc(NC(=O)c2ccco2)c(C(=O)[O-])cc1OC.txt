Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc(NC(=O)c2ccco2)c(C(=O)[O-])cc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex molecule that includes a pyrrole ring system, an amide group, and an ester group. This structure suggests the molecule could be a ligand or inhibitor targeting enzymes or receptors involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of an amide (N-C=O) and an ester (C=O-O-) group indicates potential interactions with enzymes such as those catalyzing the formation or breakdown of these functional groups, like CYP (cytochrome P450) enzymes. CYP enzymes are known for their role in drug metabolism and are represented by several genes in the provided list, including CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
Step 3: The molecule's structure also suggests possible interaction with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which often have seven transmembrane domains and are involved in various signaling pathways. GPCRs are targeted by many drugs, and the provided list includes several genes encoding such receptors, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 4: Given the presence of a carboxylate group (-COO-), the molecule might interact with ion channels or transporters, particularly those involved in neurotransmitter reuptake. For example, SLC6A2 and SLC6A4 encode neurotransmitter transporters, and the molecule could potentially act as a modulator or inhibitor of these proteins.
Step 5: The molecule's overall structure does not suggest direct interactions with kinases, phosphatases, or other enzymes listed in the provided gene set, such as CDK2, LCK, or PTGS1.
