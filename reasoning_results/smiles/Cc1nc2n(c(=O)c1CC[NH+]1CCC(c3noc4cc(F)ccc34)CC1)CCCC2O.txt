Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1nc2n(c(=O)c1CC[NH+]1CCC(c3noc4cc(F)ccc34)CC1)CCCC2O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system and a quinoline-like structure, which are common motifs in drugs that interact with receptors or enzymes. This suggests potential interactions with genes encoding receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH-) and an amide group (-CO-) indicates the molecule could be an inhibitor or activator of enzymes such as kinases, which are often encoded by genes like ABL1, CDK2, LCK, or PTGS1.
Step 3: The molecule has a substituted phenol (phenolic hydroxyl group) and a phenyl ring, which are typical for ligands that bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are encoded by genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 4: The presence of a nitrile group (-CN) and a cyano group (-CN), which are not typically found in natural products, suggest that the molecule may have been designed as a selective inhibitor or modulator of certain enzymes or receptors, possibly targeting those involved in neurotransmission or inflammation.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and potential interactions, the related genes include: ABL1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, PTGS1.
