Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCN(CC)c1ccc2cc(C(C)=O)c(=O)oc2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring with various functional groups attached, including a pyrrole ring, an amide group, and a ketone group. This structure suggests the molecule could be a ligand or a substrate for enzymes involved in metabolism or receptors that interact with small molecules.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of a ketone group (C=O) and an amide group (CONH) indicates this molecule likely interacts with enzymes or receptors that have binding sites for these functional groups. For instance, enzymes like CYP2D6, which metabolizes drugs and xenobiotics, often have active sites that can bind to ketones and amides.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a benzene ring, which is common in many drug molecules and can interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Specific receptors such as DRD2 (Dopamine D2 receptor), HTR2A (Serotonin 5-HT2A receptor), and HRH1 (Histamine H1 receptor) are known to have benzene-like structures in their binding pockets.
Step 4: Given the complexity and potential for interaction with multiple types of proteins, it is plausible that this molecule could interact with several of the listed genes, particularly those encoding enzymes involved in metabolism (like CYP2D6, CYP2C19) and receptors (like DRD2, HTR2A, HRH1).
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related genes to this molecule include: CYP2D6, CYP2C19, DRD2, HTR2A, and HRH1. These genes encode proteins that could potentially interact with the molecule either directly through binding or indirectly through metabolic pathways. 
Summary of related gene names: CYP2D6, CYP2C19, DRD2, HTR2A, HRH1.
