Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N=c1[n-]onc1-c1noc(CCC[NH+]2C(=O)c3ccccc3C2=O)n1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains multiple functional groups such as amide (N-C=O), ester (C-O-C), and aromatic rings (cyclohexane-like structures). These functional groups are often involved in binding to proteins and can modulate their activity.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule, which is part of a heterocyclic ring, suggests that this molecule could potentially interact with receptors or enzymes containing similar nitrogen-containing motifs. This is particularly relevant for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other membrane-bound proteins that contain nitrogen-rich regions.
Step 3: Among the provided genes, several are known to encode GPCRs, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and HRH1. These receptors typically have seven transmembrane domains and often bind to small molecules, including ligands with nitrogen-containing functionalities.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure might also be relevant to enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are known to oxidize various substrates, including those with aromatic rings and amide groups.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is most likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. These genes encode proteins that may interact directly with the molecule or metabolize it within the cell.
