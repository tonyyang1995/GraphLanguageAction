Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)C(=NNc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl)C(=O)OCC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule provided is a complex structure containing multiple functional groups such as an amide (C(=O)O), a benzene ring (Ph), a nitro group (N=O), and halogen substituents (Cl). This complexity suggests it may interact with proteins that have binding sites for these functional groups.
Step 2: Considering the presence of an amide group (C(=O)O), this functional group is often found in substrates or inhibitors of enzymes like CYP2D6, which metabolizes many drugs and xenobiotics through oxidative reactions involving amides.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a benzene ring with halogen substituents (Cl), which could potentially interact with proteins involved in drug transport or metabolism. Specifically, the ATP-binding cassette transporter family (e.g., ABCB1) is known to transport various compounds across cell membranes, including those with aromatic and halogenated structures.
Step 4: Given the presence of a nitro group (N=O), this feature might be recognized by certain receptors or enzymes. For instance, nitro groups are known to activate some receptor tyrosine kinases, which are associated with genes like KDR (VEGFR2).
Step 5: The overall structure does not strongly suggest interactions with neurotransmitter receptors (like HTR2A, DRD2, etc.) or ion channels (like KCNH2, CACNA1H), but further detailed analysis would be required to confirm this.
Summary of Related Gene Names:
- ABCB1
- CYP2D6
- KDR
- LCK
Note: The molecule does not appear to be directly related to the other listed genes based on the provided structure and common biological interactions. However, this summary is based on the most likely interactions given the molecular features described. A more detailed biochemical study would be needed for comprehensive validation.
