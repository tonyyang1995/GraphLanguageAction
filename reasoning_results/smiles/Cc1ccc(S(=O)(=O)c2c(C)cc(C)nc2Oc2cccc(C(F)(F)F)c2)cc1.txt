Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)c2c(C)cc(C)nc2Oc2cccc(C(F)(F)F)c2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that contains a sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)), which is a common functional group found in drugs that interact with various receptors and enzymes. This indicates that the molecule might have pharmacological activity.
Step 2: The presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) suggests the molecule could act as an agonist or antagonist for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly those involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways. This aligns with several of the listed genes that encode GPCRs such as DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule's structure includes a thiazole ring, which is known to interact with certain enzymes like CYP2D6, an important drug-metabolizing enzyme. This interaction could influence the metabolism of the molecule itself and other drugs.
Step 4: The presence of fluorine atoms (-F) in the molecule suggests it may be designed to modulate ion channels, as some ion channel inhibitors include fluorine in their structures. This could relate to the gene KCNH2, which encodes the HERG potassium channel.
Step 5: Given the complexity and specific functional groups present in the molecule, it is likely to interact with multiple targets, including those encoded by the genes CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and CYP1A2, which are all involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics and drugs.
