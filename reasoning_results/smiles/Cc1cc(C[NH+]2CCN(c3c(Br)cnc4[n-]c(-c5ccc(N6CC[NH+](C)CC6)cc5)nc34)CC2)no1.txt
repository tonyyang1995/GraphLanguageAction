Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc(C[NH+]2CCN(c3c(Br)cnc4[n-]c(-c5ccc(N6CC[NH+](C)CC6)cc5)nc34)CC2)no1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a quinoline ring system, which is a common pharmacophore feature found in several drugs that interact with various receptors and enzymes. This structural motif can be associated with multiple genes involved in drug metabolism and receptor signaling.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (N+) indicates an amine group that could participate in hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions. Such functional groups are often involved in binding to receptors like G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are encoded by genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a bromine atom (-Br), which can serve as a substituent that may influence the molecule's pharmacokinetic properties, such as lipophilicity and metabolic stability. Brominated compounds can be relevant to genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism, such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19.
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule suggests potential interactions with ion channels and enzymes, which are encoded by genes like KCNH2 and CYP3A4, respectively. These interactions could affect the molecule's activity and pharmacological profile.
Step 5: Given the complex structure and the presence of multiple functional groups, the molecule might have diverse effects on different genes, but the primary focus seems to be on receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes involved in metabolism. Therefore, the related genes include:
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- ADRB2
- CHRM1
- CHRM3
- CHRM4
- DRD2
- DRD3
- DRD4
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- HTR6
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- KCNH2
- CYP3A4
These genes are primarily involved in receptor signaling and drug metabolism, making them relevant to the molecule's potential biological activities. Other genes listed may not have a direct relationship with the molecule based on its structure and properties described.
