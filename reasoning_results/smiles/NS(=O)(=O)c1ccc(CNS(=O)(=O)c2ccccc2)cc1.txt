Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(CNS(=O)(=O)c2ccccc2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule has a core structure consisting of a nitrogen atom with a double bond to an oxygen atom (N=O), which is characteristic of a sulfonamide group. This pattern is found in molecules that interact with certain enzymes and transport proteins.
Step 2: The molecule also contains multiple benzene rings connected by methylene groups (-CH2-). Benzene ring systems are often involved in binding to receptors and enzymes due to their aromaticity and ability to form hydrogen bonds.
Step 3: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) further suggests the molecule could interact with enzymes such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs containing these functional groups.
Step 4: Given the molecule's structure, it may interact with several G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes. For instance, it could potentially bind to adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), and serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule might interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism like CYP3A4, and possibly with kinases such as LCK.
Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP3A4, LCK.
