Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)Nc1sc(C(=O)[NH+](C)C)c(C)c1C(=O)OCC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure containing an amide group (N=C=O), a carboxylic acid group (C=O), a hydroxyl group (-OH), and a number of aromatic rings. These functional groups are characteristic of drugs that interact with receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH-) suggests that this molecule could potentially act as a reversible inhibitor or activator of enzymes, such as those involved in signal transduction pathways or drug metabolism.
Step 3: The aromatic rings in the molecule may allow for interaction with protein targets that contain binding sites for small molecules with similar structural features, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 4: Given the potential for interaction with enzymes and receptors, the molecule might be related to genes encoding proteins involved in signal transduction, neurotransmission, and drug metabolism. Specifically, it could interact with genes like CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which encode cytochrome P450 enzymes, or genes like DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which encode serotonin receptors.
Step 5: The molecule's structure also hints at possible interactions with genes encoding other receptors, such as CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4, which are muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, or genes like CNR1, which encodes the cannabinoid receptor.
