Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1[n-]c(C[NH+]2CCN(c3ccccc3[O-])CC2)nc2ccccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple functional groups such as an amide (N-C), ester (O=C), amine (N-H), and aromatic rings (benzene). It also includes a nitro group (-N[O-]) which is a key feature for identifying potential inhibitors of certain enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of the nitro group (-N[O-]) in the molecule suggests it may interact with enzymes that have a high affinity for electron-rich aromatic systems and negatively charged groups. This pattern is particularly relevant to enzymes like CYP2E1, which metabolizes drugs and xenobiotics, but since CYP2E1 is not listed, we focus on the other listed CYP enzymes.
Step 3: The molecule's structure also contains amine groups (NH+) and amide linkages, which are common in substrates and inhibitors of enzymes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism and signaling pathways. For instance, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 are known to be involved in the metabolism of drugs that contain similar functional groups.
Step 4: Given the presence of the amine group and the overall structure, this molecule could potentially interact with receptors or transporters that bind to similar chemical structures. Genes like SLC6A2 and SLC6A4, which encode neurotransmitter transporters, might be influenced by this molecule due to their binding specificity.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related genes include those involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), neurotransmitter metabolism and signaling (SLC6A2, SLC6A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), and receptor binding (CYP2D6, SLC6A2, SLC6A4).
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9

- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- SLC6A2
