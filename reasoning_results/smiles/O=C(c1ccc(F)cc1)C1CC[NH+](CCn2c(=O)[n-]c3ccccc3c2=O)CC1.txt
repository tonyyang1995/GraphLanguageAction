Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(c1ccc(F)cc1)C1CC[NH+](CCn2c(=O)[n-]c3ccccc3c2=O)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a cyano group (-CN), a fluorine substituent (F), and an amide group (-CONH2). These structural features are often found in ligands that interact with receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of the amide group suggests the molecule could be an inhibitor or agonist of enzymes like CYP2D6, which metabolizes many drugs, and HTR2A, which is involved in neurotransmission.
Step 3: The fluorine substituent might indicate the molecule has lipophilic properties, which could affect its binding to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and HRH1.
Step 4: Given the presence of a cyano group, the molecule might have affinity for ion channels, such as KCNH2, or receptors like DRD2 and DRD3, which are known to bind molecules with similar functional groups.
Step 5: The overall structure, including the amide and aromatic parts, suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism and signaling pathways, such as CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and PTGS1.
