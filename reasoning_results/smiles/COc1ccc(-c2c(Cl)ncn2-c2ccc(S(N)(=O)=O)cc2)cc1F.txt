Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(-c2c(Cl)ncn2-c2ccc(S(N)(=O)=O)cc2)cc1F, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule in question contains a fluorine atom (F) and a sulfonamide group (-S(N)(=O)=O), which are common functional groups in pharmaceuticals. These features suggest that the molecule could interact with proteins involved in drug metabolism or transport.
Step 2: The presence of a quinoline-like ring system (COc1ccc(-c2c(Cl)ncn2-c2ccc(S(N)(=O)=O)cc2)cc1) indicates potential binding sites for proteins that recognize aromatic rings, such as certain receptors or enzymes. This suggests possible interactions with genes encoding receptors or enzymes that have aromatic binding pockets.
Step 3: The molecule includes a pyridine ring (c1ccc(-c2c(Cl)ncn2-c2ccc(S(N)(=O)=O)cc2)cc1) and a heterocyclic structure, which are common in ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This pattern is particularly relevant to genes like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which encode dopamine receptors.
Step 4: Given the complexity and specific structural features of the molecule, it likely interacts with multiple targets, including those encoded by the CYP family of enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are involved in phase I drug metabolism.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and its potential interactions with various proteins, the related genes include: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. These genes are primarily associated with neurotransmitter signaling and drug metabolism. Summary of related gene names: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
