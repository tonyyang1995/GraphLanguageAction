Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+]1CCC(=C2c3ccccc3CC(=O)c3sccc32)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other type of explanation.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (N+), which suggests it could be an amine derivative. This feature is relevant to receptors that bind amine ligands, such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B) and cholinergic receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 2: The molecule also includes a benzene ring system connected to a carboxamide group (-CONH2), which is characteristic of certain ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural pattern is pertinent to receptors like the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CNR1), dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), and serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Step 3: The presence of a quinoline-like structure (quinoline is a common substructure in many drug molecules) might indicate interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Step 4: The molecule's overall size and shape, along with its functional groups, suggest potential binding to voltage-gated sodium channels (CACNA1H), which are important in neuronal signaling.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule may interact with the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CNR1, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CACNA1H. 
Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CNR1, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CACNA1H.
