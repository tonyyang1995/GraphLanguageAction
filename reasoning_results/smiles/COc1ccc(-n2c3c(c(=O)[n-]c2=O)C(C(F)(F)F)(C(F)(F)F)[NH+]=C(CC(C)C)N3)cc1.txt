Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(-n2c3c(c(=O)[n-]c2=O)C(C(F)(F)F)(C(F)(F)F)[NH+]=C(CC(C)C)N3)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex molecule containing several functional groups such as a benzene ring, amide, alcohol, and carboxylic acid. Notably, the presence of an amide group (-CONH-) suggests this molecule could act as a ligand or modulator for receptors that bind to amine-containing molecules.
Step 2: The molecule also includes fluorine atoms attached to carbon atoms, which are often found in drug molecules due to their lipophilic properties, enhancing absorption and distribution within the body. This feature may indicate the molecule has pharmacological activity, possibly targeting receptors that interact with fatty acids or other lipophilic ligands.
Step 3: Given the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), the molecule might have acidic properties, which could be relevant for its interaction with protonated receptors or ion channels. The carboxylic acid could also form ester bonds or participate in hydrogen bonding, affecting the molecule’s ability to bind to certain proteins.
Step 4: Considering the pattern of functional groups and the potential for interaction with receptors, the molecule might be related to genes encoding receptors that recognize amine-containing ligands (e.g., adrenergic and cholinergic receptors) or those that respond to acidic conditions (e.g., proton-sensing ion channels).
Step 5: Based on the structural features and potential interactions, the related genes include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, which encode adrenergic and cholinergic receptors, as well as serotonin receptors. These genes are involved in various physiological processes, including neurotransmission and hormone signaling.
