Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COCCOc1cc2[n-]ccc(=Nc3[n-]nc(C)c3C)c2cc1S(=O)(=O)C(C)(C)C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with multiple functional groups, including an amide, a sulfonate ester, and several aromatic rings. This structure suggests that the molecule could be involved in various biological processes such as binding to receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: Analyzing the molecular structure, it contains a quaternary nitrogen (N+), which is characteristic of protonated amine groups. This feature is relevant to molecules that can act as ligands for ion channels or receptors, particularly those containing protonated amino groups.
Step 3: The presence of a sulfonate ester group (-SO3-) is indicative of potential interactions with sulfhydryl-containing proteins or enzymes, such as cysteine-rich domains. This structural element may interact with thiols present in certain receptor proteins or enzymes.
Step 4: Considering the pattern of aromatic rings and the overall complexity of the molecule, it is likely to have interactions with membrane-bound receptors or transporters. Among the listed genes, those encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels are particularly relevant due to their membrane localization and the presence of functional groups that could interact with them.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule is most likely related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CACNA1H, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, LCK, and SIGMAR1. These genes encode receptors and ion channels that could potentially interact with the described molecular structure.
