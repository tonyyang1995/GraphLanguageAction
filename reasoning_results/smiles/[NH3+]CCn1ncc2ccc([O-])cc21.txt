Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [NH3+]CCn1ncc2ccc([O-])cc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains an amine group (-NH3+) and a pyrrolidine ring (n1ncc2ccc([O-])cc21). These functional groups suggest potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for basic amino acids or cyclic structures.
Step 2: The presence of a pyrrolidine ring and the amine group could indicate a possible interaction with receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B) and dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), which often bind basic amino acid-containing ligands.
Step 3: The molecule also has a benzene ring (CC) connected to the pyrrolidine ring, which might interact with enzymes like CYP2D6, known to metabolize drugs with aromatic rings.
Step 4: The overall structure does not directly suggest a strong interaction with kinases (like LCK) or G-protein coupled receptors (like HRH1), but it may influence downstream signaling pathways involving these proteins.
Step 5: Based on the structural features, the molecule could be related to ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2D6, and HRH1. 
Summary of related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2D6, HRH1.
