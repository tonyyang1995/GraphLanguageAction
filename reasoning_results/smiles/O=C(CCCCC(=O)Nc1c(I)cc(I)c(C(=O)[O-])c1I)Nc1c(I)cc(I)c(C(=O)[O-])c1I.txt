Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(CCCCC(=O)Nc1c(I)cc(I)c(C(=O)[O-])c1I)Nc1c(I)cc(I)c(C(=O)[O-])c1I, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule with a complex structure containing multiple functional groups such as carbonyl (C=O), amide (-CONH-), imidazole rings (c1c(I)cc(I)c1), and carboxylate (-COO-) groups. This structure suggests that the molecule could be involved in interactions with proteins that have binding sites for similar functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of carboxylate and amide groups indicates potential interactions with proteins that have acidic or basic amino acid residues in their active sites. This is relevant to genes encoding receptors and enzymes that interact with small molecules through hydrogen bonding or electrostatic interactions.
Step 3: The imidazole rings in the molecule suggest it might bind to proteins with histidine residues, which are common in ion channels and receptors. This aligns with genes like HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HRH1, which encode serotonin and histamine receptors.
Step 4: The molecule's overall structure and functional groups also hint at potential interactions with enzymes and transporters. Genes such as CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4, which encode enzymes and transporters involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmitter reuptake, may be particularly relevant.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and the genes it may interact with, the related genes include: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HRH1, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, SLC6A2, SLC6A4. These genes are involved in neurotransmitter signaling and drug metabolism. 
Summary of related genes: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HRH1, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
