Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(=O)N1CCc2cc(S(=O)(=O)NC(Cc3ccccc3)C(=O)NC3CCCCCC3)ccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other type of explanation.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with a carboxamide group attached to it. This structural feature is characteristic of molecules that can interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are often involved in signaling pathways regulated by various genes.
Step 2: The presence of a sulfoxide group (-S(=O)(=O)-) in the molecule suggests potential interaction with enzymes such as CYP2C19, which metabolizes drugs containing similar functional groups.
Step 3: The molecule includes a quinoline-like structure, which could interact with ion channels, particularly those encoded by genes like KCNH2, which encodes a potassium voltage-gated channel.
Step 4: The overall structure hints at the possibility of the molecule being an inhibitor or modulator of tyrosine kinase activity, given the presence of aromatic rings and potential binding sites for kinase domains, relevant to genes like KDR and LCK.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and interactions discussed, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: CYP2C19, KCNH2, KDR, LCK. 
Related Gene Names: CYP2C19, KCNH2, KDR, LCK.
