Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)CN=c1[n-]c(N2CC[NH+](CC3CCCOC3)CC2)ncc1C(=O)NCc1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a tricyclic amide structure with a quinoline ring system and a benzene ring fused to it. This complex structure is often found in molecules that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are known to be involved in various signaling pathways and are associated with several of the listed genes.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group and a nitrogen atom within the molecule suggests potential interactions with receptors that have binding sites for such functional groups, particularly GPCRs like adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 3: The molecule also includes a pyridine ring and a cyano group, which could indicate potential interactions with enzymes such as CYP2D6, which metabolizes drugs containing these functional groups.
Step 4: Given the overall structure and functional groups, the molecule might interact with receptors involved in neurotransmitter systems, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, which are known to bind various ligands including those with amide and aromatic functionalities.
Step 5: Considering the above structural and functional characteristics, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2D6, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4. 
Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2D6, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
