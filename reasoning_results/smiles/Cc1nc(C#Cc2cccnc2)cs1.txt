Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1nc(C#Cc2cccnc2)cs1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure that includes a benzene ring with substituents such as methyl groups, an aromatic ring with a nitrogen atom, and a cyano group (-CN). This pattern suggests the molecule could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction or transport processes.
Step 2: Considering the substituents and the overall structure, the molecule likely contains functional groups that could be recognized by receptors or enzymes. For instance, the cyano group could act as a ligand for certain receptors, while the benzene ring might interact with hydrophobic pockets of proteins.
Step 3: Given the presence of a cyano group and a benzene ring, this molecule could potentially bind to or modulate the activity of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are known to have benzene rings and/or cyano groups in their ligands. This would make ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4 relevant.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure may influence its ability to inhibit or activate enzymes, such as those involved in drug metabolism. CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 are examples of enzymes that could be affected by this molecule due to their known interactions with structurally similar compounds.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and potential binding sites, the related genes are ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These genes encode proteins that are directly involved in the interaction or metabolism of the described molecule. 
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6.
