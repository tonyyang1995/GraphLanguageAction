Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string [NH3+]CCc1ccc([O-])cc1 describes a molecule that consists of an amine group (-NH3+) attached to a benzene ring, which is further connected to a heterocyclic ring (c1ccc([O-])cc1). This structure suggests the presence of a nitrogen atom with a positive charge and an oxygen atom with a negative charge, indicating a charged or polar nature.
Step 2: Considering the structure, this molecule likely interacts with proteins that have binding sites for charged or polar molecules, such as ion channels, receptors, or transporters. These proteins often play roles in signal transduction pathways and neurotransmission.
Step 3: Among the provided genes, several are known to encode proteins involved in neurotransmitter systems, including receptors and transporters. For instance, DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), HTR1A (Serotonin receptor 1A), and SLC6A4 (Serotonin transporter) could potentially interact with this molecule due to its charged nature and potential to modulate neurotransmission.
Step 4: Additionally, some of the genes listed encode enzymes that may be influenced by this molecule's structure, such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 (cytochrome P450 enzymes), which metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics, possibly interacting with this charged molecule during metabolism.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and the described interactions, the related genes include: DRD2, HTR1A, SLC6A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19.
Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2
- HTR1A
- SLC6A4
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19 Step 1: The molecule described by the SMILES string has a positively charged amine group and a negatively charged oxygen atom, suggesting it is a polar molecule.
Step 2: Polar molecules often interact with proteins that have binding sites for charged or polar compounds, such as ion channels and receptors.
Step 3: Genes encoding receptors and transporters, like DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), HTR1A (serotonin receptor 1A), and SLC6A4 (serotonin transporter), are likely to be involved due to their role in neurotransmission.
Step 4: Metabolic enzymes such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 (cytochrome P450 enzymes) might also interact with the molecule, as they process many drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 5: Summary of related genes: DRD2, HTR1A, SLC6A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19.
