Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(OC)c2c(=S)c3ccccc3[n-]c12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a phenolic group (-OH) and a sulfonamide (-S=O) group. These functional groups are often involved in binding to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are proteins encoded by many of the listed genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and HRH1.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) suggests potential interaction with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are encoded by the corresponding genes.
Step 3: The molecule's overall structure, including its hydrophobic and polar regions, indicates it could interact with ion channels, like KCNH2, which is encoded by the KCNH2 gene.
Step 4: The presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (indicated by 'n' in the SMILES string) suggests potential binding to ionotropic receptors or transporters, possibly related to SLC6A2, SLC6A4, or OPRK1.
Step 5: Given the complexity and pattern of the molecule, it is most likely to interact with multiple GPCRs, enzymes involved in drug metabolism, ion channels, and transporters, suggesting a broad range of related genes including: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, KCNH2, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, and OPRK1. Step 5: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, KCNH2, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, OPRK1.
