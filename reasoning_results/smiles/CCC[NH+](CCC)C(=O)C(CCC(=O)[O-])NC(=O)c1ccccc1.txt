Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCC[NH+](CCC)C(=O)C(CCC(=O)[O-])NC(=O)c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple functional groups such as amide, ester, and amine. It also includes aromatic rings and a central nitrogen atom with a positive charge. This structure suggests that the molecule could potentially interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways and neurotransmitter systems.
Step 2: Considering the presence of amide and ester groups, this molecule could be related to enzymes involved in metabolic processes. For instance, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are known to metabolize drugs and xenobiotics through oxidation reactions involving these functional groups. Additionally, CYP3A4 is another enzyme that might be involved in the metabolism of this molecule due to its broad substrate specificity.
Step 3: The molecule's amine group and overall structure suggest potential interactions with receptors. DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4 are dopamine receptors, which can bind to various ligands including small molecules like the one described. HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 are serotonin receptors, which might also interact with this molecule due to its structural similarity to known ligands for these receptors.
Step 4: Given the presence of aromatic rings and the overall complexity of the molecule, it could influence ion channels. KCNH2 is an example of a potassium channel that might be affected by such molecules due to their ability to modulate ion permeability through the membrane.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule may have relationships with several genes including CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and KCNH2.
