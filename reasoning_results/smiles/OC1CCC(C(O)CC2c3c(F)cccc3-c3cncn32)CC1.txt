Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: OC1CCC(C(O)CC2c3c(F)cccc3-c3cncn32)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with a central benzene ring (OC1CCC(C(O)CC2c3c(F)cccc3-c3cncn32)CC1). This structure contains a phenolic group (-OH) and an aromatic ring, which are common in molecules that interact with certain receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a fluorine atom (-F) attached to a benzene ring (c3c(F)cccc3) suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolic pathways, such as those encoded by CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Step 3: The overall structure also includes a cyclic amide and ester linkage, which could indicate binding to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 4: The molecule's ability to interact with receptors and enzymes suggests it may have effects on signaling pathways and metabolism, potentially impacting genes involved in these processes, like PTGS1 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1).
Step 5: Based on the structural features and potential interactions, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, PTGS1.
