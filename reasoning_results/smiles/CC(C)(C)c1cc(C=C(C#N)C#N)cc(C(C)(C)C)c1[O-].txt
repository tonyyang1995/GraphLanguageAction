Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)(C)c1cc(C=C(C#N)C#N)cc(C(C)(C)C)c1[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a tricyclic structure with a nitrogen atom bearing a double bond to a carbon atom, which is part of a cyclic amide group. This pattern suggests potential interactions with receptors that have similar chemical features, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 2: The presence of a nitrosoamine (-N=C=N-) moiety in the molecule could indicate potential binding to enzymes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism, such as monoamine oxidases (MAOs). CYP enzymes, particularly CYP2D6, are also known to metabolize drugs containing aromatic nitroso groups.
Step 3: The molecule's overall structure includes multiple functional groups like amides, amines, and aromatic rings, which can interact with various proteins, including ion channels and receptors. For example, CACNA1H encodes a voltage-gated calcium channel that might be influenced by the molecule due to its structural complexity.
Step 4: Given the presence of a quinoline-like structure and aromatic substituents, the molecule may influence enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 5: The molecule's ability to potentially bind to and modulate the activity of receptors and enzymes suggests it could impact several signaling pathways, including those involving neurotransmitters. Genes like HTR2A, HTR2B, and DRD2, which encode serotonin and dopamine receptors respectively, could be affected by the molecule.
