Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N=c1nc(-c2c(-c3ccc(F)cc3)ncn2C2CCCCC2)cc[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compound with multiple rings, including a pyrrole ring, a furan ring, and a benzene ring. It also contains a nitrile group (-CN), which is typically involved in drug metabolism and binding to proteins. The presence of a fluorine atom (-F) suggests it might have specific interactions with certain proteins that recognize or bind to halogenated compounds.
Step 2: Given the structure, this molecule could potentially interact with proteins involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways due to its size and functional groups, particularly the aromatic rings and the nitrile group. GPCRs are known to be targets for various drugs, and their ligands often contain similar structural elements.
Step 3: Notably, the molecule's structure aligns well with the characteristics of molecules that can interact with receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4). These receptors are known to modulate various physiological responses and are often targets for therapeutic interventions.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a nitrogen-nitrogen double bond (N=N) and the overall planar structure suggest potential interaction with ion channels, which might relate to the voltage-gated calcium channel CACNA1H, though direct evidence would need further investigation.
Step 5: Considering the potential interactions with receptors and ion channels, the related genes include those encoding adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), and the voltage-gated calcium channel CACNA1H.
