Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(COc1ccc(-n2ccnc2)cc1)Nc1ccc(-c2ccccc2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a molecule that appears to be a complex organic compound with a benzene ring, a carboxylic acid group, and various functional groups such as amide, ester, and cyclic nitro groups. The presence of these structural elements suggests that this molecule could potentially interact with proteins involved in signal transduction, neurotransmission, and drug metabolism.
Step 2: Analyzing the molecule's structure further, we observe the presence of an amide group (-CONH-) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which are common in molecules that can act as ligands for receptors or enzymes. These functional groups are particularly relevant to the G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes that are encoded by several of the listed genes.
Step 3: Considering the GPCR family, the molecule's structure aligns well with the features of compounds that can bind to these receptors. For instance, the cyclic nitro group and the amide group could be involved in forming hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions necessary for receptor binding. Relevant GPCRs include DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, all of which are listed in the given gene list.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's carboxylic acid group could also interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize many drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related genes that the molecule might be associated with include: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. These genes encode proteins that are involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism, respectively.
