Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(C[NH+]2C(=O)CCC2C(=O)NCc2cccnc2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a quinolone-like structure with a nitrogen atom that carries a positive charge, suggesting it may be an acridine derivative. This type of structure is often found in ligands for various receptors and transporters.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a benzene ring with a cyano group (-CN), which could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, such as kinases. Notably, the LCK gene encodes a tyrosine kinase that plays a role in T-cell receptor signaling and B-cell receptor signaling.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group suggests the molecule might have anti-inflammatory properties, potentially interacting with enzymes like COX-2 (PTGS2, not listed but related to PTGS1). The gene PTGS1 codes for cyclooxygenase-1, an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of prostaglandins.
Step 4: The molecule's overall structure and functional groups indicate it could bind to or inhibit G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are common targets for drugs. For instance, the HTR2A gene codes for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, which is involved in mood regulation and neurotransmission.
Step 5: Considering the above structural and functional characteristics, the molecule may be related to the following genes: ABL1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KDR, LCK, OPRK1, and SLC6A2.
