Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: c1ccc(-c2nc(C[NH+]3CCN(c4ncccn4)CC3)c[n-]2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule has a complex structure featuring multiple rings, including aromatic and heteroaromatic rings, as well as amide and amine functional groups. This complexity suggests that it could interact with various proteins involved in signaling pathways, transport mechanisms, or enzymatic activities.
Step 2: Analyzing the potential interactions, the presence of amide and amine functionalities might allow for binding to receptors or enzymes such as those encoded by G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) genes. For instance, the amine group could potentially bind to adrenergic and cholinergic receptors, which are encoded by genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and HTRs (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Step 3: The molecule also contains a quinolone-like structure, which is characteristic of compounds that may inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes. This feature could be relevant to genes encoding CYP enzymes, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which play crucial roles in drug metabolism.
Step 4: Given the presence of a pyrrolidine ring and other structural motifs, the molecule might have affinity for G-protein coupled receptors or ion channels, potentially interacting with genes like HRH1 (histamine receptor), KCNH2 (potassium channel), and LCK (tyrosine kinase).
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and functional groups, the molecule is likely to interact with multiple genes involved in neurotransmitter systems, receptor signaling, and drug metabolism, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and KCNH2.
