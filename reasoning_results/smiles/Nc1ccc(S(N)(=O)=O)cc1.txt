Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Nc1ccc(S(N)(=O)=O)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule is a nitroimidazole derivative, specifically a nitroimidazole-based sulfonamide. It contains a nitrogen atom, a sulfur atom, and a carboxylate group, which are characteristic functional groups that may interact with certain receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylate group (-COOH) suggests potential interactions with ion channels or transporters, such as those encoded by SLC6A2 (solute carrier family 6 member 2), which is involved in the reuptake of dopamine.
Step 3: The sulfur atom and the carboxylate group could also suggest potential interactions with enzymes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are involved in the metabolism of various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 4: The molecule's structure does not directly suggest strong binding to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like those encoded by HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are known for their involvement in neurotransmitter signaling.
Step 5: Given the molecule's structure, it is most likely to interact with genes involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19) and neurotransmitter reuptake (SLC6A2).
