Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: c1ccc2nc(N3CC[NH2+]CC3)ccc2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings and functional groups, including an imidazole ring, a pyrrole ring, and amine functionalities. This type of chemical structure is often associated with molecules that can interact with various receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of an amine group (-NH2) suggests the molecule could potentially act as a ligand or modulator for receptor proteins. The imidazole ring, being a common component in many bioactive compounds, might also contribute to interactions with certain receptors.
Step 3: Considering the pattern of the molecule and its potential to interact with receptors, we can infer that it might be related to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are known to have amine groups and are involved in various signaling pathways. Some of the genes listed are directly involved in GPCR signaling or are receptors themselves.
Step 4: Specifically, the molecule's structure could be related to the following genes:
- **CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4**: These genes encode muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, which are GPCRs and could interact with a compound having an amine group.
- **HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6**: These genes encode serotonin receptors, another class of GPCRs that could potentially bind to a molecule with an amine functionality.
- **DRD2, DRD3, DRD4**: These genes encode dopamine receptors, which are also GPCRs and could interact with a compound containing an amine group.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4. These genes are all involved in GPCR signaling pathways and could potentially interact with the described molecular structure. 
List of related genes: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
