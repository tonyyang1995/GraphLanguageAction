Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)n1cc(C[NH+]2CCC(C(=O)Nc3cccc(-c4cccc(Cl)c4)c3)CC2)cn1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule has a complex structure that includes a benzene ring, amine groups, and a quinoline-like core, suggesting it may be an organic compound with potential biological activity.
Step 2: Analyzing the molecular structure for patterns that could indicate interactions with specific genes, we see the presence of aromatic rings and functional groups such as amide and ester bonds. These structural elements are often involved in binding to proteins and modulating their activity.
Step 3: Considering the functional groups present (amine, amide, and possibly ester), this molecule could interact with enzymes or receptors that have similar functional groups, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Step 4: Given the potential for interaction with enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism, and considering the presence of amine and amide groups, the molecule might affect the expression or activity of these genes.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule could potentially interact with genes involved in neurotransmitter transport and signaling, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and SLC6A4, due to the presence of amine groups.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9

- HTR2C
- SLC6A4 Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with aromatic rings, amine groups, and a quinoline-like core, indicating potential biological activity.
Step 2: The presence of amine and amide groups suggests possible interactions with enzymes and receptors.
Step 3: Structural features like amides and amines are common in compounds that interact with enzymes such as cytochrome P450s (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6).
Step 4: Aromatic rings and amine groups suggest potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and neurotransmitter transporters (e.g., HTR1A, HTR2A, SLC6A4).
Step 5: The molecule likely affects genes involved in neurotransmitter signaling and metabolism, including CYP enzymes and GPCRs.
- SLC6A4
Note: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, and other receptor-related genes are not directly indicated by the molecule's structure but could be indirectly related through their roles in neurotransmitter signaling. However, they are not explicitly supported by the given structure. Therefore, they are not included in the summary.
