Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC1NC(=O)NC1CCCCCC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)c(Cl)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings and functional groups including amides, esters, and aromatic rings. This complexity suggests it could interact with various proteins and enzymes.
Step 2: Analyzing the SMILES string, we observe that the molecule contains a central benzene ring with attached substituents such as methyl, phenyl, and fluoro groups, along with a pyrrolidine ring and an amide group. These structural features are indicative of potential interactions with receptors, transporters, and enzymes involved in signal transduction and metabolism.
Step 3: Given the presence of an amide and ester group, this molecule might be a ligand for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are known to bind to peptides and other small molecules containing amide bonds. Additionally, the aromatic nature of the molecule could suggest interactions with enzymes like CYP enzymes, which metabolize many drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 4: Considering the identified functional groups and the potential for receptor binding, the molecule may have a relationship with genes encoding GPCRs and enzymes involved in drug metabolism. Specific genes include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and DRD2, among others.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2. These genes encode proteins that could potentially interact with or be affected by the given molecule based on its structural features. ADRA1D and ADRA2B encode adrenergic receptors, ABL1 encodes a tyrosine kinase, while the CYP enzymes are involved in the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics. DRD2 encodes a dopamine receptor. Step 1: The provided molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings and functional groups including amides, esters, and aromatic rings. This complexity suggests it could interact with various proteins and enzymes.
Step 2: The molecule contains a central benzene ring with attached substituents such as methyl, phenyl, and fluoro groups, along with a pyrrolidine ring and an amide group. These structural features indicate potential interactions with receptors and metabolic enzymes.
Step 3: The presence of an amide and ester group suggests the molecule might act as a ligand for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and could also interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes, which metabolize many drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 4: Considering the potential for receptor binding and metabolic activity, the molecule may be related to genes encoding GPCRs and enzymes involved in drug metabolism. Specific genes include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP
