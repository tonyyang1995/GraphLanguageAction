Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(C[NH3+])cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a molecule that includes a sulfonamide group (NS(=O)(=O)) and a tricyclic aromatic ring system. This structure is characteristic of many nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and other chemically diverse compounds.
Step 2: The presence of a sulfonamide group (NS(=O)(=O)) suggests potential interaction with sulfotransferases, particularly those involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are related to the CYP family of enzymes mentioned in the list.
Step 3: The tricyclic aromatic ring system is reminiscent of structures found in beta-blockers such as propranolol, which are known to interact with adrenergic receptors. Specifically, this could relate to the ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, and CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4 genes encoding adrenergic and cholinergic receptors.
Step 4: Given the overall structure, there is no direct indication of a strong interaction with the listed genes related to tyrosine kinases, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), or specific metabolic pathways such as EGFR, PTGS1, or SLC6A2.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule may have interactions with genes encoding for:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- ADRB2
- CHRM1
- CHRM3
- CHRM4
These genes encode proteins that could potentially interact with the described molecular structure through enzymatic activity or receptor binding.
