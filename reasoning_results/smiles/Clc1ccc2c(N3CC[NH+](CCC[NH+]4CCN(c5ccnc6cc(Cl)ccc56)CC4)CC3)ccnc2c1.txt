Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Clc1ccc2c(N3CC[NH+](CCC[NH+]4CCN(c5ccnc6cc(Cl)ccc56)CC4)CC3)ccnc2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge, which suggests it may interact with proteins that have binding sites for positively charged amino acids. This characteristic is relevant to several G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are involved in dopamine signaling.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a benzene ring system, which could potentially interact with aromatic residues in protein binding sites. This feature is relevant to CYP enzymes like CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The presence of multiple aromatic rings and potential hydrogen bond donors/acceptors indicates the molecule might interact with proteins that have similar structural features, such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are serotonin receptors.
Step 4: The molecule’s overall structure, including its size and functional groups, could suggest interactions with enzymes like CYP3A4, which metabolizes various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 5: Based on the molecule’s structural features, it is likely to be related to the following genes: CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C. Step 6: Summary of related genes: CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C.
