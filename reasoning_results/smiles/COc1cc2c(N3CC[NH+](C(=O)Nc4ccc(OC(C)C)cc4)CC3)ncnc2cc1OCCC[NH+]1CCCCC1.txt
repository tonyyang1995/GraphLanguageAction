Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc2c(N3CC[NH+](C(=O)Nc4ccc(OC(C)C)cc4)CC3)ncnc2cc1OCCC[NH+]1CCCCC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule contains a complex structure including a benzene ring system, a pyridine ring, and various functional groups such as amides, esters, and hydroxyl groups. This structure suggests that the molecule could be a ligand or an inhibitor targeting receptors or enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (N+) and amide (-CONH2) and ester (-COOR) functionalities indicates that this molecule could interact with proteins that have binding sites for positively charged amino acids and/or acidic or basic functional groups. This feature is relevant to receptors like adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), and serotonergic receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Step 3: The presence of a benzene ring and hydroxyl groups suggests potential interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are known to metabolize drugs and xenobiotics. This interaction could influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the molecule.
Step 4: The molecule's overall complexity and functional groups indicate it might be designed to modulate multiple biological processes, which could involve several genes such as HRH1, PTGS1, and SIGMAR1. These genes encode for proteins that play roles in neurotransmission and inflammation, respectively.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HRH1, PTGS1, SIGMAR1. These genes are involved in signaling pathways and metabolic processes that the molecule might affect. 
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HRH1, PTGS1, SIGMAR1.
