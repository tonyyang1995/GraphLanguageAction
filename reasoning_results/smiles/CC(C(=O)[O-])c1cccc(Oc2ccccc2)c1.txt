Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C(=O)[O-])c1cccc(Oc2ccccc2)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule provided is a complex organic compound that includes a carboxyl group (-COOH), an ester group (-OC(=O)-), and a negatively charged oxygen atom (-O-). This structure suggests it could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors involved in signaling pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring (C(=O)[O-]) and a substituted amide (CC(C(=O)[O-])) indicates potential binding sites for enzymes such as CYP (cytochrome P450) enzymes, which are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics. This suggests the molecule might interact with genes encoding these enzymes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a quinoline ring (c1cccc(Oc2ccccc2)c1), which is characteristic of compounds that can act as agonists or antagonists at G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structure aligns with the potential modulation of receptors encoded by genes such as DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), HTR2A (serotonin receptor 5-HT2A), and HRH1 (histamine receptor H1).
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of multiple aromatic rings and functional groups suggests this molecule could influence ion channels and transporters. For instance, the structure might interact with the voltage-gated sodium channel encoded by KCNH2, or the GABA transporter encoded by SLC6A2.
Step 5: Considering the above structural features, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A, HRH1, KCNH2, and SLC6A2.
Summary of related genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A, HRH1, KCNH2, SLC6A2.
