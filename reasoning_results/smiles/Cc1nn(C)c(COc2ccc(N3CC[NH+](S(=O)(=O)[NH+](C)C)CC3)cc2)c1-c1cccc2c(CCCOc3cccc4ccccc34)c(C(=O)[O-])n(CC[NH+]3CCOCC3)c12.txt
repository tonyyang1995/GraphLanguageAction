Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1nn(C)c(COc2ccc(N3CC[NH+](S(=O)(=O)[NH+](C)C)CC3)cc2)c1-c1cccc2c(CCCOc3cccc4ccccc34)c(C(=O)[O-])n(CC[NH+]3CCOCC3)c12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains multiple aromatic rings and heteroatoms such as nitrogen and oxygen, which are common in ligands that interact with receptors and enzymes. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in signal transduction and metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) and an amide (-CONH-) within the molecule indicates it could act as a modulator for receptors that recognize such functional groups, like adrenergic and muscarinic receptors. These receptors are known to be influenced by molecules with similar functional groups.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a quinolone-like structure (quinoline ring), which is characteristic of certain drugs that target G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structure could interact with receptors such as DRD2, HTR1A, and others listed, which have been shown to bind to quinolone derivatives.
Step 4: Given the presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and ester (-COOR) functionalities, this molecule may interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are responsible for oxidizing various substrates including many pharmaceuticals.
Step 5: Considering the overall complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, this molecule likely has a broad pharmacological profile affecting several genes related to neurotransmission, hormone regulation, and metabolism. Specifically, the related genes include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, PTGS1, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4. Step 1: The molecule contains multiple aromatic rings and heteroatoms such as nitrogen and oxygen, which are common in ligands that interact with receptors and enzymes. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in signal transduction and metabolism.
Step 4: Given the presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and ester (-COOR) functionalities, this molecule may interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and
