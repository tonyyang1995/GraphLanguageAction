Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C1c2ccccc2S(=O)(=O)[NH+]1Cc1cccc(F)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a central carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom, which is then single-bonded to another oxygen atom forming a carbonyl group (O=C). This core structure is characteristic of a class of molecules known as oxazolones. The molecule also contains a sulfur atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom (S(=O)(=O)), indicating the presence of a sulfoxide group. Additionally, there are multiple aromatic rings attached to the central structure, including a benzene ring and a naphthalene-like ring.
Step 2: The molecule has a positively charged nitrogen atom (NH+) attached to a benzene ring, which is typical of certain pharmacophores that interact with ion channels and receptors. The presence of fluorine atoms (F) attached to the benzene ring suggests the molecule could have specific interactions with proteins involved in signaling pathways.
Step 3: Considering the molecular structure and its potential for interaction with biological targets, several genes could be relevant. These include those encoding for receptors and ion channels, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KDR, and LCK, due to their involvement in signal transduction pathways and neurotransmission.
Step 4: The molecule's ability to form hydrogen bonds and its hydrophobic regions suggest it might interact with enzymes like CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism and could influence the pharmacokinetics of the molecule.
Step 5: Given the pattern of functional groups and the potential for interactions with receptors and enzymes, the related genes can be summarized as follows: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KDR, LCK, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6.
