Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(C(=O)[NH+]2CCN(c3ccc4c(c3)CCC(=O)N4)CC2)cc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring system and an amide group, which are common in ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This suggests potential interactions with genes encoding GPCRs.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a benzene ring with a carboxamide group, indicating possible binding to enzymes involved in metabolism or signaling pathways.
Step 3: The presence of a quinoline-like moiety and a pyridine ring suggests potential interactions with genes involved in drug metabolism and transport, such as those encoding cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs).
Step 4: The molecule has a nitrogen atom with a positive charge, which could interact with negatively charged sites on proteins, possibly affecting genes related to ion channels or neurotransmitter receptors.
Step 5: Based on the structural features, the molecule is likely to be related to genes such as CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, and SIGMAR1, among others that encode proteins involved in metabolism, neurotransmission, and signal transduction.
