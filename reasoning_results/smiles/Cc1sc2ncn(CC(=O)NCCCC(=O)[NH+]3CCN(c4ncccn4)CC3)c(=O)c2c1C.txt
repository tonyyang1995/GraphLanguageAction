Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1sc2ncn(CC(=O)NCCCC(=O)[NH+]3CCN(c4ncccn4)CC3)c(=O)c2c1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a complex structure including aromatic rings, heteroatoms (such as nitrogen and oxygen), and functional groups like amides and esters. These structural features suggest that the molecule could interact with proteins involved in various biological processes such as signal transduction, enzyme activity, and receptor binding.
Step 2: Analyzing the functional groups in the molecule, we observe the presence of an amide group (-CONH-) and an ester group (-COO-). Amides are common in many drugs that act as agonists or antagonists for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), while esters can be substrates for enzymes such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: Given the presence of multiple nitrogen atoms, particularly in the amide and amidine groups, the molecule might have affinity for GPCRs. Specific GPCRs mentioned among the provided genes include DRD2 (Dopamine D2 receptor), HTR1A (Serotonin 5-HT1A receptor), HTR2A (Serotonin 5-HT2A receptor), and HTR2B (Serotonin 5-HT2B receptor).
Step 4: Considering the presence of ester and amide groups, the molecule could also be a substrate for CYP enzymes. Genes related to CYP enzymes include CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which play crucial roles in drug metabolism.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and potential interactions, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes involved in neurotransmitter signaling and drug metabolism. The related gene names are: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6. 
Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- CYP1A2
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
Note: The other genes listed do not appear to have a direct relationship based on the molecule's structure and known functions. However, it's important to note that molecular interactions can sometimes be indirect, and further experimental validation would be necessary to confirm any specific relationships.
