Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COC(=O)c1cc2ccsc2n1CC(=O)Nc1ccc(N(C)C)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with a carboxamide group and a cyano group, suggesting it may interact with enzymes or receptors involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) is indicative of potential interaction with enzymes such as CYP2E1, which metabolizes compounds with this functional group, although CYP2E1 is not listed among the provided genes.
Step 3: The molecule's structure includes a pyrrole ring, which could potentially interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Among the provided genes, HTR2A and HTR2B are GPCRs that may be affected by compounds containing a pyrrole ring.
Step 4: The presence of a quinoline-like structure in the molecule might indicate potential interactions with enzymes like CYP2D6, which metabolizes drugs with similar structures; however, CYP2D6 is not listed among the provided genes.
Step 5: Given the complexity of the molecule and its potential interactions with receptors, particularly those involved in neurotransmission, the related genes include HTR2A, HTR2B.
Related Genes: HTR2A, HTR2B Step 5: Summary of Related Genes: HTR2A, HTR2B.
