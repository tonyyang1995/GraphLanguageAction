Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCN(CC)c1ccc(NC(=O)C[NH+]2CCN(c3ccccc3F)CC2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure containing a benzene ring with multiple substituents, including an amide group (-CONH2), a phenyl group, and a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3). This structure suggests that the molecule may be involved in interactions with proteins that have binding sites for similar chemical moieties.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-CONH2) indicates potential interactions with enzymes and receptors that have amine or carboxylic acid functional groups. For example, this could include cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) which are known to metabolize drugs containing amide bonds.
Step 3: The aromatic ring system in the molecule may interact with proteins that contain transmembrane domains or have hydrophobic binding pockets. Examples include G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), and adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2).
Step 4: Given the presence of a phenolic group and potential for hydrogen bonding due to the amide functionality, the molecule might also interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways. For instance, the tyrosine kinase receptor KDR (VEGFR2) could be a target, as it binds small molecules with similar hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties.
Step 5: Considering the diverse functionalities present in the molecule, it could potentially interact with multiple targets, making it difficult to pinpoint a single gene. However, based on the above analysis, some of the most likely related genes are: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, ADRB2, and KDR.
