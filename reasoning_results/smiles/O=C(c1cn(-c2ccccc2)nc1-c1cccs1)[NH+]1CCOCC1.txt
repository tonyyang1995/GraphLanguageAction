Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(c1cn(-c2ccccc2)nc1-c1cccs1)[NH+]1CCOCC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with a central double-bonded carbon (O=C), a cyclic nitro group (-c1cn(-c2ccccc2)nc1-c1cccs1), and a positively charged amine group ([NH+]1). The cyclic nitro group is characteristic of molecules that can interact with various receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The cyclic nitro group (-c1cn(-c2ccccc2)nc1-c1cccs1) in the molecule suggests potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are often involved in signal transduction pathways mediated by neurotransmitters and hormones. This is because cyclic nitro groups can form hydrogen bonds and other interactions with the amino acid residues of these receptors.
Step 3: Among the provided genes, several are known to be involved in GPCR signaling pathways: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes encode for adrenergic and muscarinic receptors, as well as serotonin receptors, which are all GPCRs.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure may also interact with enzymes involved in metabolism and drug processing, such as those encoded by CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. These cytochrome P450 enzymes are known to metabolize a wide range of drugs and xenobiotics, and their interactions with the molecule could affect its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and the potential interactions with the aforementioned receptors and enzymes, the related genes are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.
