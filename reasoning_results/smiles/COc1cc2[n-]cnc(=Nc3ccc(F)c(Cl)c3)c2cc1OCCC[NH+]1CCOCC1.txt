Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, a pyridine ring, and an amide group. These structural elements are common in ligands that interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other membrane-bound proteins. GPCRs are often associated with neurotransmission and hormone signaling.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (N+) suggests that the molecule could be a partial agonist or antagonist for certain GPCRs, which are known to have positively charged binding sites. This pattern is consistent with molecules that interact with receptors like adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B) and dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4).
Step 3: The molecule also has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which can form hydrogen bonds and contribute to the interaction with receptors that have hydrophobic cavities. Such interactions are typical for molecules targeting receptors like adrenergic receptors (ADRB2) and serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule contains a fluorine atom (F) and a chlorine atom (Cl), which can act as lipophilic substituents and enhance the binding affinity to membrane-bound receptors. This feature is relevant to the interaction with adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2).
Step 5: Considering the above structural features, the molecule is likely to interact with several GPCRs, including adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), and serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
