Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCn1cc(C(=O)[O-])c(=O)c2cc(F)c(N3CC[NH2+]C(C)C3)c(F)c21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains several functional groups such as amide (-CONH2), carboxyl (-COOH), alcohol (-OH), and fluorine substituents. The presence of an amide group suggests that this molecule could be a drug that interacts with enzymes or receptors.
Step 2: The molecule has a cyclic structure with multiple rings, including a pyrrole ring (n1cc1) and a benzene ring (Cc1cc(C(=O)[O-])c1). These aromatic structures are often found in molecules that bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other protein targets.
Step 3: Given the presence of an amide group and the overall structure, this molecule might interact with enzymes such as CYP2D6, which is involved in the metabolism of many drugs, and CYP3A4, another important cytochrome P450 enzyme that metabolizes numerous drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 4: The molecule also has potential to interact with receptors. The amide and carboxyl groups, along with the overall shape, suggest it could bind to receptors like HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A), HTR2B (serotonin receptor 2B), and HTR2C (serotonin receptor 2C), all of which are part of the serotonin signaling pathway.
Step 5: Based on the structure and functional groups, the related genes include CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C.
Summary of related genes:
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
Note: The molecule does not appear to have a direct relationship with the other listed genes based on its structure and functional groups. However, interactions with these genes could influence pharmacological effects and metabolism of the molecule.
