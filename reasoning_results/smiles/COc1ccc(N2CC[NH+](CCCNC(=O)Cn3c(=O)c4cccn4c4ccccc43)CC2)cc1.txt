Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(N2CC[NH+](CCCNC(=O)Cn3c(=O)c4cccn4c4ccccc43)CC2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with a central benzene ring system, which is substituted with various functional groups such as amine (-NH2), nitrile (-CN), amide (-CONH-), and ester (-COOR) functionalities. The presence of these functional groups suggests that the molecule could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction, receptor binding, and enzymatic activities.
Step 2: Among the listed genes, several are known to encode for receptors or enzymes that might interact with molecules containing amine, amide, and ester functionalities. For example, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and DRD2, DRD3, DRD4 are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that bind to various ligands, including small molecules with amine and amide groups. These receptors are involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways.
Step 3: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are cytochrome P450 enzymes that play a crucial role in the metabolism of xenobiotics and endogenous compounds. The presence of amine and amide functionalities in the molecule indicates it could be a substrate for these enzymes, leading to potential drug-drug interactions or altered pharmacokinetics.
Step 4: CYP3A4 is another important cytochrome P450 enzyme that metabolizes numerous drugs and xenobiotics. Given the complexity of the molecule, it is possible that CYP3A4 could also be involved in its metabolism, potentially affecting the molecule's bioavailability and pharmacodynamics.
Step 5: EGFR and PTGS1 encode for proteins that are involved in cellular signaling pathways and inflammation, respectively. Although the molecule does not have obvious structural motifs that directly suggest interaction with these proteins, its metabolic products might still influence their activity through secondary effects.
Summary of related gene names:
- ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2
