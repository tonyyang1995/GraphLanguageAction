Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc1NC(=O)CC(C)c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring system, a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (imidazole), and several functional groups including an amide and a carboxylic acid. The presence of a nitrogen atom in the heterocycle and the presence of functional groups that can interact with proteins suggest potential interaction with proteins encoded by certain genes.
Step 2: The benzene ring system is common in many drugs and can form hydrophobic interactions with transmembrane domains of receptors and transporters, which are often encoded by genes such as ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein), ABL1 (a tyrosine kinase), and CYP2D6 (a cytochrome P450 enzyme). These interactions could influence the molecule's pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.
Step 3: The imidazole ring and amide group might allow for hydrogen bonding, which can be important for interactions with receptors like adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), as well as G-protein coupled receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Step 4: The presence of a carboxylic acid group may indicate potential for interaction with ion channels, such as KCNH2, which encodes the hERG potassium channel, and LCK, a protein kinase involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 5: Given the complexity and functional groups present, this molecule likely has multiple potential targets among the listed genes, including ABCB1, ABL1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CNR1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, LCK, OPRK1, PPARG, PTGS1, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, and possibly others not listed here.
