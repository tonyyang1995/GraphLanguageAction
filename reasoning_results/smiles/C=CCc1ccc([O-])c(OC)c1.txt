Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C=CCc1ccc([O-])c(OC)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a double bond (C=CC), indicating it has aromatic properties and could potentially interact with receptors that recognize such structures.
Step 2: Attached to this aromatic core is a pyrrole ring system (c1ccc([O-])c(OC)c1), which may contribute to the molecule's ability to bind to specific protein targets, possibly including G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The presence of an oxygen atom in the pyrrole ring and a hydroxyl group (OC) suggests the molecule could act as a ligand for receptors involved in signaling pathways, such as those modulated by adrenergic and cholinergic receptors.
Step 4: Given the structural features, the molecule might be related to genes encoding for GPCRs, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4, as well as other neurotransmitter-related genes like HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C.
Step 5: Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C. 
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C. Step 5: Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C.
