Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCC1(c2ccccc2)C(=O)NCNC1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that is structurally similar to a benzodiazepine derivative. This class of molecules often interacts with GABA-A receptors, which are involved in neurotransmission and have been linked to various psychiatric disorders.
Step 2: Analyzing the pattern of the molecule, it contains a central three-carbon chain (CCC) flanked by two aromatic rings (c2ccccc2). This structural feature is reminiscent of benzodiazepines, which bind to the GABA-A receptor to modulate chloride ion channels, influencing neuronal excitability.
Step 3: Given the interaction pattern of benzodiazepine derivatives with GABA-A receptors, the molecule could potentially interact with genes encoding proteins involved in the GABAergic system. Key genes include those encoding for the GABA-A receptor subunits (e.g., CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), which are crucial for neurotransmission and are implicated in various neurological and psychiatric conditions.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule may also interact with genes associated with signal transduction pathways that are downstream of GABAergic signaling, such as HTR2A (serotonin 5-HT2A receptor), which is involved in mood regulation and has been linked to schizophrenia and depression.
Step 5: Considering the potential interactions and known functions, the related genes for this molecule would be: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR2A.
Summary of Related Genes:
- CHRM1
