Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([N-]OCCO)c1ccc2cncn2c1Nc1ccc(I)cc1F, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with several functional groups including an amide group (C=O), a nitro group (-NO2), an amine group (-NH2), and various aromatic rings. This structure suggests that the molecule could potentially interact with proteins involved in signal transduction, neurotransmission, or drug metabolism due to its diverse functional groups.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of a nitro group (-NO2) and aromatic rings indicates that this molecule might have pharmacological activity, possibly acting as a modulator of receptors or enzymes. The nitro group is often associated with compounds that inhibit certain enzymes, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs).
Step 3: Among the listed genes, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 are all members of the cytochrome P450 family, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs. Given the potential for the molecule to interact with these enzymes due to its nitro group, it is reasonable to consider these genes as candidates for further investigation.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of aromatic rings and the overall structure of the molecule suggest possible interactions with receptors. For example, HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A) and HTR2C (serotonin receptor 2C) are G-protein coupled receptors that may be influenced by molecules with similar structural features.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis and the potential pharmacological activities suggested by the molecule's features, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, HTR2A, and HTR2C.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP1A2
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
- HTR2A
- HTR2C
