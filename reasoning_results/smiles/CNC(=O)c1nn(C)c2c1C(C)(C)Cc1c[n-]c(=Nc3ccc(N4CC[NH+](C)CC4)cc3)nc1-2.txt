Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CNC(=O)c1nn(C)c2c1C(C)(C)Cc1c[n-]c(=Nc3ccc(N4CC[NH+](C)CC4)cc3)nc1-2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with a benzene ring attached to a pyrrole ring via an amide bond, which is a common feature in many drugs that interact with neurotransmitter receptors. This structure suggests potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are known to be regulated by various genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
Step 2: The molecule also contains a quinoline ring system, which is characteristic of several drugs that modulate the activity of enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9 and CYP2D6. These enzymes are encoded by the CYP2C9 and CYP2D6 genes, respectively.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a carboxamide group and a phenyl ring in the molecule could indicate potential interactions with ion channels and transporters, such as KCNH2 and SLC6A4. These proteins are encoded by the KCNH2 and SLC6A4 genes, respectively.
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule does not show any clear affinity for kinases, which are encoded by genes like LCK and FLT1, or for receptor tyrosine kinases, such as KDR. Therefore, these genes are less likely to be directly related to this molecule.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the genes related to this molecule include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, KCNH2, and SLC6A4. These genes encode proteins that may interact with or be affected by the molecule through mechanisms such as receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or modulation of ion channel activity.
