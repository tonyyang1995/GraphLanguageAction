Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCc1cc(=O)oc2cc(OCC(=O)N3CCc4ccccc43)ccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule containing multiple functional groups such as a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), amide groups (-CONH-), and aromatic rings. This structure suggests that the molecule could interact with proteins involved in receptor binding, transport, or enzymatic activity.
Step 2: Analyzing the molecule's structure for potential interaction sites, we observe that it has an amide group and a carboxylic acid group, which are common in ligands for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other membrane receptors. GPCRs are known to be regulated by various genes listed, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
Step 3: The presence of an aromatic ring system in the molecule also indicates possible interactions with enzymes that metabolize drugs or neurotransmitters, such as those encoded by CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. These enzymes play crucial roles in the metabolism of many pharmaceuticals and endogenous compounds.
Step 4: Furthermore, the molecule's overall structure might allow it to bind to ion channels or voltage-gated channels, which are associated with genes like KCNH2 and KDR. These channels are involved in various physiological processes and may be modulated by small molecules.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to have interactions with several of the provided genes, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, KCNH2, and KDR.
