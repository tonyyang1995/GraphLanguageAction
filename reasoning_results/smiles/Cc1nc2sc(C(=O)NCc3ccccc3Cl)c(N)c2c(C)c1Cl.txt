Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1nc2sc(C(=O)NCc3ccccc3Cl)c(N)c2c(C)c1Cl, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with a sulfone group (-SO2-) attached to it. This structural feature is often involved in interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP), specifically CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are known to metabolize drugs containing similar functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of a quinolone-like structure (quinoline ring) suggests potential interactions with genes related to neurotransmitter receptors, particularly those involved in serotonin signaling pathways, such as HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A).
Step 3: The molecule also includes a carboxamide group (-CONH2), which can interact with various protein targets including G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels. This might suggest potential interactions with genes encoding for receptors like DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2) and CHRM1 (cholinergic receptor, muscarinic 1).
Step 4: The overall structure indicates a potential for binding to membrane proteins and may influence signaling pathways related to calcium and potassium ions, possibly involving genes like KCNH2 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2) and CACNA1H (calcium voltage-gated channel alpha1 subunit H).
Step 5: Given the identified structural features, the molecule could be related to several genes, including CYP2C9, CYP2C19, HTR2A, DRD2, CHRM1, KCNH2, and CACNA1H.
