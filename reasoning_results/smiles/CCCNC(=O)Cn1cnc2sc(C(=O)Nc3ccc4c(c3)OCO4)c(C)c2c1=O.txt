Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCNC(=O)Cn1cnc2sc(C(=O)Nc3ccc4c(c3)OCO4)c(C)c2c1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a molecule that contains a benzene ring system, a pyridine ring, and several functional groups such as amide (-CONH2), ester (RCOOR'), and aromatic rings. This structural complexity suggests the molecule could be a drug-like compound or a bioactive molecule.
Step 2: Considering the presence of an amide group (-CONH2) and an ester group (RCOOR'), this molecule likely has pharmacological activity, potentially acting as a ligand for various receptors or enzymes. These functional groups are common in molecules that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Step 3: The presence of the amide and ester groups might indicate potential interactions with genes involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways. Specifically, the amide group could interact with receptors like adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), which are known to have amine or amide ligands. The ester group could suggest a potential interaction with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4.
Step 4: Additionally, the benzene and pyridine rings present in the molecule may also indicate potential interactions with other receptors or enzymes. For instance, the benzene ring could suggest a possible interaction with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), as these receptors often have benzene rings in their ligands.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and the functional groups present, the molecule is most likely related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4.
Summary of related gene names:
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- ADRB2
- DRD2
- DRD3
- DRD4
- CHRM1
- CHRM3
- CHRM4
- CYP2D6
- CYP2C9
- CYP3A4 Step 5: Summary of related gene names:
