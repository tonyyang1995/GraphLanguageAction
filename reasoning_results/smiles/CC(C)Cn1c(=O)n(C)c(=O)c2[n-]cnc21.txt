Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)Cn1c(=O)n(C)c(=O)c2[n-]cnc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is common in many drugs that interact with receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmission or signal transduction pathways. This structural feature suggests potential interactions with genes encoding receptors or enzymes that are involved in these pathways.
Step 2: The presence of multiple amide groups (N=C=O) indicates that the molecule could be an inhibitor or substrate for enzymes like CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19, which are known to metabolize various drugs including those affecting neurotransmitter systems.
Step 3: The nitrogen-containing heterocycles (such as pyrrolidine and piperidine) suggest possible interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are encoded by genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These receptors play key roles in neurotransmission.
Step 4: The presence of a quinoline ring in the molecule may indicate potential interactions with the gene CYP1A2, which encodes an enzyme involved in drug metabolism and also has some role in the metabolism of neurotransmitters.
Step 5: The overall structure of the molecule, with its complex functional groups and rings, likely allows it to interact with multiple targets, including enzymes and receptors encoded by the listed genes, particularly those involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction.
