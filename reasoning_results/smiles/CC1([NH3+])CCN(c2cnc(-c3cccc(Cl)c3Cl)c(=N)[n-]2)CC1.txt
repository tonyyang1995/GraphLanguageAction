Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC1([NH3+])CCN(c2cnc(-c3cccc(Cl)c3Cl)c(=N)[n-]2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other type of content.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (NH3+), which suggests it may act as a ligand for receptors that bind positively charged molecules.
Step 2: The presence of multiple aromatic rings and heteroatoms (such as nitrogen and chlorine) indicates the molecule could interact with various types of receptors, including G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels.
Step 3: Several of the listed genes are involved in the expression or function of GPCRs, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4. The molecule's structure might allow it to bind to these receptors.
Step 4: The molecule also has potential to interact with enzymes like CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, given its complex structure and presence of functional groups that could be metabolized by these enzymes.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and the genes' functions, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.
Related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
