Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc(C(=O)[O-])cc(OC)c1[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with a carboxylic acid group and an alcohol group attached to it, which suggests it may be a drug-like compound with potential pharmacological activity. This structural feature indicates that the molecule could interact with various receptors or enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alcohol group (-OH) suggests the molecule might be an inhibitor or agonist of enzymes or receptors that have similar functional groups, such as kinases, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), or ion channels. These functional groups are common in small molecules that modulate the activity of proteins involved in cellular signaling.
Step 3: Given the molecular structure, the compound could potentially interact with several genes that encode for proteins involved in neurotransmitter systems, such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), and serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6). These receptors are known targets for drugs affecting mood, anxiety, and other neuropsychiatric conditions.
Step 4: The molecule might also influence genes encoding for enzymes involved in metabolism and drug processing, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, due to its chemical structure. These cytochrome P450 enzymes play crucial roles in the biotransformation of xenobiotics and endogenous compounds, making them important targets for drug development and pharmacogenomics.
Step 5: Considering the molecule's potential to interact with multiple receptor types and metabolic enzymes, it is likely to affect a range of biological processes regulated by the listed genes, including neurotransmission, pain perception, inflammation, and cell growth.
