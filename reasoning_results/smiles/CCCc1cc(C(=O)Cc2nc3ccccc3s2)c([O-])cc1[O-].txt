Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCc1cc(C(=O)Cc2nc3ccccc3s2)c([O-])cc1[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples or additional unnecessary information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with an amide group attached to it. This structural feature is often involved in interactions with proteins that have binding sites for such molecules, particularly those involved in signal transduction pathways and neurotransmitter systems.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group suggests potential interactions with enzymes and receptors that recognize and bind to this functional group. Enzymes like CYP2D6, which metabolizes many drugs and xenobiotics, might interact with this molecule due to its amide functionality.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a sulfonamide moiety, which is known to be recognized by certain drug targets, including some G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are associated with multiple genes listed here, such as DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 4: Given the overall structure and functional groups, the molecule could potentially interact with ion channels and transporters. For instance, CACNA1H, which codes for a voltage-gated calcium channel, and SLC6A2 and SLC6A4, which are involved in neurotransmitter transport, could be relevant targets.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes involved in neurotransmission and metabolism, including: CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CACNA1H, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4. Step 5: Summary of Related Genes: CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CACNA1H, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
