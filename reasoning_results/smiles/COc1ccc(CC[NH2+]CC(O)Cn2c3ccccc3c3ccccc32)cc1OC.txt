Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(CC[NH2+]CC(O)Cn2c3ccccc3c3ccccc32)cc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a nitrogen atom bearing a positive charge, indicating it may be an amine derivative with potential for interacting with receptors that bind such molecules.
Step 2: The presence of a cytosine (C) and pyrimidine (N) in the structure suggests it might have affinity for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which often interact with such ligands.
Step 3: Specific GPCRs like DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 are known to bind amine derivatives and could potentially interact with this molecule due to its structural features.
Step 4: The molecule also includes a benzene ring with a hydroxyl group, which could indicate potential interactions with enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 involved in drug metabolism.
Step 5: Based on the molecule’s structure and functional groups, the related genes include DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4.
Summary of related genes: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4.
