Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CN(C)c1ccc(C(CNC(=O)c2ccc(F)cc2)c2c[nH]c3ccccc23)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex molecule containing a benzene ring with various substituents such as cyclohexane, methyl groups, and a heterocyclic nitrogen atom. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, receptor binding, and metabolic processes.
Step 2: The presence of a heterocyclic nitrogen atom and functional groups like amide (N-C=O), which is present in the molecule, indicates that it could interact with receptors that have similar functional groups, such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). These receptors are known to be involved in various signaling pathways and neurotransmission.
Step 3: The molecule's structure also includes a quinolone-like motif, which is characteristic of certain ligands for serotonin receptors (e.g., 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, and 5-HT6 receptors). Serotonin receptors play crucial roles in mood regulation, pain perception, and other physiological functions.
Step 4: Given the structural features of the molecule, particularly its ability to potentially bind to and modulate GPCRs and serotonin receptors, it is likely to interact with genes encoding these receptors. These include HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are involved in serotonin signaling and neurotransmission.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule might also interact with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, due to its functional groups that could serve as substrates or inhibitors of these enzymes.
