Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(C(=O)N=c2[n-]c3ccc4nc(C)sc4c3s2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure that includes a pyrrole ring fused to a benzene ring, with a carbonyl group attached to the benzene ring. This structure suggests potential interactions with receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (pyrrole) and an amide group (carbonyl-nitrogen bond) indicates that this molecule could interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which often have binding sites for molecules containing nitrogen heterocycles and amides. Specifically, it may target receptors such as adrenergic (adrenaline) receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 3: The molecule also contains a carboxamide group (-CONH-) and a quinolone-like structure, which are characteristic of compounds that can inhibit certain enzymes. For instance, the CYP (cytochrome P450) family of enzymes, particularly CYP2D6 and CYP2C9, are known to be inhibited by similar structures. Therefore, this molecule might interact with CYP enzymes, including CYP2D6 and CYP2C9.
Step 4: Given the overall structure and functional groups, this molecule could potentially modulate the activity of various receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and metabolism. This suggests possible interactions with multiple genes, including but not limited to those encoding for receptors and enzymes mentioned above.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9.
