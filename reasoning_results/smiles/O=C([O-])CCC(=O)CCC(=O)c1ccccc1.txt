Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])CCC(=O)CCC(=O)c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule, represented by the SMILES string O=C([O-])CCC(=O)CCC(=O)c1ccccc1, contains an aromatic ring system with a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to one of the carbon atoms in the ring. This structure is indicative of a potential ligand for receptors that interact with various signaling pathways and neurotransmitter systems.
Step 2: The presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group suggests that this molecule could potentially interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are known to be involved in signal transduction pathways and neurotransmission. GPCRs are activated by various ligands, including neurotransmitters and hormones, and play a crucial role in many physiological processes.
Step 3: Among the given genes, several are associated with GPCRs or other receptor families that might be relevant to the molecule's structure. For instance, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and DRD2, DRD3, DRD4 are all GPCRs that could potentially bind to or be modulated by the molecule due to its phenolic hydroxyl group and overall aromatic structure.
Step 4: Additionally, CYP2D6, a cytochrome P450 enzyme involved in drug metabolism, might also be relevant if the molecule is a substrate or inhibitor of this enzyme. However, without further information about the molecule's pharmacokinetic properties, this relationship cannot be confirmed.
Step 5: Based on the analysis, the related gene names are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, and CYP2D6.
