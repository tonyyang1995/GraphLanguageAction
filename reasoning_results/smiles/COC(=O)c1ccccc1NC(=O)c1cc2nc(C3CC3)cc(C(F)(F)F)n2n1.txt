Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COC(=O)c1ccccc1NC(=O)c1cc2nc(C3CC3)cc(C(F)(F)F)n2n1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule, which appears to be a derivative of a benzodiazepine-like structure. Benzodiazepines are known for their ability to interact with GABA-A receptors, which are chloride channels that play a significant role in inhibiting neuronal activity.
Step 2: Analyzing the structure, we observe several substituents such as fluorine groups (-F) and a carboxamide group (N=C=O). These functional groups suggest the molecule could have binding affinity to various receptors, particularly those involved in neurotransmission. The presence of a carboxamide group might indicate the molecule could act as an agonist or antagonist at certain receptor sites.
Step 3: Considering the gene features, the molecule's structure is most likely to interact with genes encoding neurotransmitter receptors, particularly those involved in GABAergic signaling and dopaminergic pathways. This is due to the benzodiazepine-like core and the potential for the molecule to modulate ion channels and receptor function.
Step 4: Given this analysis, the genes most closely related to the molecule are those encoding receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction, such as GABA-A receptors, dopamine receptors, and enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the following genes are most likely to be directly or indirectly affected by the molecule: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, and SIGMAR1. These genes encode for receptors and enzymes that are involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism.
