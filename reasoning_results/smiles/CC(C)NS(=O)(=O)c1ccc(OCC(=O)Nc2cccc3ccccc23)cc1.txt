Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(OCC(=O)Nc2cccc3ccccc23)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains several functional groups such as amide (N=O), ester (O=C-O), and aromatic rings (cyclohexane-like structures). Notably, it has an amide group (-CONH-) which is characteristic of many drugs that interact with receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an amide group suggests that this molecule could act as a ligand for receptors or enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways, particularly those that are activated by G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The molecule also includes a benzene ring with an oxygenated substituent, which could indicate potential interactions with proteins that bind to or metabolize similar structures, such as certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP enzymes).
Step 4: Considering the presence of a benzene ring and an amide group, this molecule might be related to genes encoding GPCRs, ion channels, and enzymes involved in drug metabolism. Specifically, it could potentially interact with receptors like DRD2 (Dopamine D2 receptor), HTR2A (Serotonin 5-HT2A receptor), and HRH1 (Histamine H1 receptor).
Step 5: The molecule's structure also hints at possible interactions with CYP enzymes, suggesting a relationship with genes like CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4, which are involved in the metabolism of various drugs.
Summary of related gene names: DRD2, HTR2A, HRH1, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP3A4.
