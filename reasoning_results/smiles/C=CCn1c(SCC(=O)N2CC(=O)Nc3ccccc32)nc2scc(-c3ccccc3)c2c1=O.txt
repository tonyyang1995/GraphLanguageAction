Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C=CCn1c(SCC(=O)N2CC(=O)Nc3ccccc32)nc2scc(-c3ccccc3)c2c1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule containing several functional groups such as an amide (C=O), a nitrile (-CN), a nitro group (-NO2), and aromatic rings. This structure suggests the molecule could be a drug-like compound, potentially interacting with various biological targets.
Step 2: Analyzing the molecular structure further, we notice the presence of a benzene ring system with attached substituents including a carboxamide, a sulfonyl group, and a nitrile. These functional groups are often involved in interactions with receptors and enzymes that play roles in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways.
Step 3: Considering the gene list provided, several genes are directly associated with neurotransmitter receptors and signaling pathways. For instance, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 encode for different subtypes of serotonin receptors, which are known to interact with molecules possessing similar structural features to the given compound.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure could potentially interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are part of the cytochrome P450 family. These enzymes are crucial for metabolizing many drugs, including those targeting the nervous system.
Step 5: Based on the analysis of the molecule's structure and its potential interactions, the related genes include those encoding serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) and enzymes involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6).
