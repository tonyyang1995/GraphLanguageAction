Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: OCCN=c1[n-]c(N2CCOCC2)nc(=NCCC2=CCCCC2)[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples.
Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound containing nitrogen, oxygen, carbon, and other elements. It includes a pyrrolidine ring, an imidazole ring, and multiple aromatic rings, indicating potential interactions with receptors that contain these functional groups. 
Step 2: Considering the molecular structure, it likely interacts with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are characterized by seven transmembrane domains and are known to bind small molecules. The presence of amine groups (-NH2) and aromatic rings suggests possible binding to receptors like adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 3: The molecule also contains a quinolone moiety, which could interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism such as cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). These enzymes play a crucial role in the metabolism of drugs and can affect the pharmacokinetics of substances interacting with them.
Step 4: Given the presence of a nitro group (-NO2) and other polar functional groups, the molecule may also interact with ion channels and transporters, such as those encoded by KCNH2 (a potassium channel subunit) and SLC6A4 (a serotonin transporter). This interaction could modulate the activity of these proteins, affecting their function.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, KCNH2, SLC6A4. These genes encode proteins that are directly involved in receptor binding, enzyme activity, and ion channel function, which are critical for the molecule's potential biological effects. 
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, KCNH2, SLC6A4.
