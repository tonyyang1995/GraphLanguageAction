Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(=O)N=c1[n-]nc(S(N)(=O)=O)s1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a structure that includes an amide (C=O), a nitrogen with a negative charge, and a sulfhydryl group (-S-). These functional groups suggest potential interactions with proteins that have similar functional groups or binding sites.
Step 2: The molecule's amide group could potentially interact with proteins containing histidine residues, which are common in protein-protein interactions and can form hydrogen bonds with amides. Histidine residues are found in several of the listed genes, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The negative nitrogen in the molecule might interact with positively charged residues, such as lysine or arginine, which are commonly found in transmembrane receptors and ion channels. Genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, and ADRB2 encode for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that typically contain positively charged residues.
Step 4: The sulfhydryl group in the molecule could participate in disulfide bond formation or interact with cysteine residues, which are important for maintaining protein structure and function. SLC6A4, which encodes the serotonin transporter, contains cysteine residues that may be involved in forming disulfide bonds.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and the interactions described above, the molecule is likely to be related to the genes encoding GPCRs (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and enzymes involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
