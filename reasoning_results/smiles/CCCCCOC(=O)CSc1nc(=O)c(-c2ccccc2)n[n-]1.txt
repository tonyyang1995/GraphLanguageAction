Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCCOC(=O)CSc1nc(=O)c(-c2ccccc2)n[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure including multiple benzene rings, a carbonyl group, and a cyclic amide moiety. This structure suggests that it might be a ligand or substrate for enzymes or receptors involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: Analyzing the pattern of the molecule, we see that it contains a pyrrole ring (part of the cyclic amide moiety) and a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH). These functional groups are often recognized by G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are encoded by several genes listed here such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and DRD2-DRD4.
Step 3: The presence of a carbonyl group and the overall aromatic structure of the molecule indicates potential interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes like CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 4: Given the complexity of the molecule and its likely involvement in metabolic pathways, it could also interact with enzymes involved in neurotransmitter synthesis or degradation, such as PTGS1 (which codes for COX-1, an enzyme in prostaglandin biosynthesis) and SLC6A2/4 (which code for transporters involved in the reuptake of neurotransmitters).
Step 5: Based on the structural features identified, the molecule may be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, PTGS1, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4. 
Summary of related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
