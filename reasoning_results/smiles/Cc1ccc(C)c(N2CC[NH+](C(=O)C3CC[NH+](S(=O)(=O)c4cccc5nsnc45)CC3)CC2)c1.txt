Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(C)c(N2CC[NH+](C(=O)C3CC[NH+](S(=O)(=O)c4cccc5nsnc45)CC3)CC2)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a quinoline ring system, which is characteristic of several drugs that interact with various receptors and transporters. Notably, it has a pyrrolidine ring fused to the quinoline, suggesting potential interactions with enzymes or receptors that contain similar functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the pyrrolidine ring and the amide group (N-C(=O)-C) indicate that this molecule could potentially act as an agonist or antagonist for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as adrenergic (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic cholinergic receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 3: The molecule also includes a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a sulfonamide group (NS), which are often found in compounds that inhibit enzymes involved in metabolism, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). These groups might suggest the molecule could be an inhibitor of these enzymes, affecting their activity.
Step 4: The molecule's overall structure, with its complex functional groups, could potentially interact with multiple targets, including receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and hormone signaling. This complexity suggests it may have a broad impact on various pathways, such as those involving serotonin (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) and dopamine (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) receptors.
Step 5: Considering the molecular structure and the presence of functional groups that can interact with various biological targets, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
