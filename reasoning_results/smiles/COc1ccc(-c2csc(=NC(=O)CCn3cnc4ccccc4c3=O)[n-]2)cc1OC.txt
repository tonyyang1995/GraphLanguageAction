Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(-c2csc(=NC(=O)CCn3cnc4ccccc4c3=O)[n-]2)cc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that includes functional groups such as a carbonyl (CO), aromatic rings, and a cyclic amide (N-C=O). The presence of a cyclic amide suggests this molecule could potentially interact with proteins that have binding sites for amide-containing molecules.
Step 2: The molecule also contains a thiazole ring system, which is known to be involved in various biological processes, including enzyme inhibition and receptor modulation. This structural feature could indicate potential interactions with enzymes or receptors that contain thiazole binding sites.
Step 3: Notably, the molecule has a nitrile (-CN) group attached to an aromatic ring, which might suggest it could interact with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) could imply that the molecule may interact with proteins containing hydrophobic binding pockets, such as those found in receptors like HTR2A (serotonin receptor).
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and functional groups present, the most likely related genes would be those encoding enzymes involved in drug metabolism (CYP2D6, CYP3A4), receptors that interact with amides and phenols (HTR2A), and enzymes that could bind to thiazole rings (not specifically listed but relevant).
Summary of Related Genes:
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- HTR2A
These genes encode proteins that could interact directly or indirectly with the described molecule based on its structural features. Other genes might also be relevant depending on additional functional assays or studies.
