Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NC(=[NH2+])N=C([NH3+])[NH+]1CCOCC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains several functional groups including an amide (NC), an imine (=[NH2+]), and amine functionalities ([NH3+] and [NH+]). These functional groups are often involved in binding to proteins and can modulate receptor activity.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom with positive charge ([NH+] and [NH3+]) suggests that this molecule may interact with ion channels or receptors that have positively charged residues in their binding sites. This could include G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) which are known to be modulated by small molecules containing basic functional groups.
Step 3: The molecule also has a phenolic hydroxyl group (OH) attached to a benzene ring, which is characteristic of compounds that can act as agonists or antagonists for estrogen receptors (ER). This is due to the ability of such molecules to mimic the structure of estradiol, a natural ligand for ER.
Step 4: Given the pattern of the molecule and its potential interactions with receptors and ion channels, it is likely to affect neurotransmitter systems, particularly those involving dopamine and serotonin. This is supported by the presence of amine groups and the overall structural similarity to known ligands for these neurotransmitters.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule is most likely to be related to the following genes: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, ESR1, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.
Summary of related gene names:
- CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4
- DRD2, DRD3, DRD4
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- ESR1
- CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4
These genes are involved in the modulation of cholinergic, dopaminergic, and serotonergic pathways, as well as drug metabolism via cytochrome P450 enzymes. The molecule's structure supports its potential interaction with these biological targets. Step 1: The molecule contains several functional groups including an amide (NC), an imine (=[NH2+]), and amine functionalities ([NH3+] and [NH+]). These functional groups are often involved in binding to proteins and can modulate receptor activity.
Step 4: Considering the molecule's structure and potential interactions
