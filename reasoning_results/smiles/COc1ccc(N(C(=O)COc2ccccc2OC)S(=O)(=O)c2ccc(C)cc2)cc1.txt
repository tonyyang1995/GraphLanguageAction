Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(N(C(=O)COc2ccccc2OC)S(=O)(=O)c2ccc(C)cc2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a complex structure including a benzene ring with various functional groups such as amide (N(C(=O)CO)), thioether (S(=O)(=O)), and hydroxyl (-O). These functional groups suggest the molecule may interact with proteins that have binding sites for these functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (CO) and an ester (COc2ccccc2OC) suggests the molecule could potentially interact with enzymes involved in metabolism or signaling pathways, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a benzene ring system with multiple substituents, which could interact with transmembrane receptors. For instance, adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4) have binding sites for ligands with similar aromatic structures.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure might be relevant to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) and dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), due to its potential to form hydrogen bonds and other interactions with these receptors' binding pockets.
Step 5: Lastly, the presence of a thiophosphate group (S(=O)(=O)) and a carboxylic acid could indicate the molecule's interaction with enzymes like CYP1A2, which is involved in phase I metabolism, and PTGS1, which codes for cyclooxygenase-1, an enzyme in the inflammatory response pathway.
Summary of related gene names: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, PTGS1.
