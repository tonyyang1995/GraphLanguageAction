Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc(C(=O)OCCC[NH+]2CCC[NH+](CCCOC(=O)c3cc(OC)c(OC)c(OC)c3)CC2)cc(OC)c1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with multiple substituents, including an amide group (-CO-NH-) and an ester group (-CO-O-). This structural pattern suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism and neurotransmitter regulation.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring with substituents, particularly the amide and ester groups, indicates possible binding to receptors and transporters that interact with similar chemical moieties. For example, this could involve G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYPs).
Step 3: The molecule's chemical structure may influence the activity of CYP enzymes, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics through oxidation processes.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule might interact with neurotransmitter systems, potentially affecting receptors like HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are involved in serotonin signaling.
Step 5: The related genes include CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C. These genes encode enzymes and receptors that could be directly affected by or interact with the molecule's chemical structure. 
Summary of related gene names: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C.
