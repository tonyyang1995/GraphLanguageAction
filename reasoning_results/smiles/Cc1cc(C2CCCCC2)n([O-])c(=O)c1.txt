Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc(C2CCCCC2)n([O-])c(=O)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule has a benzene ring with a nitrogen atom attached, which is part of an imidazole ring system. This structure suggests potential interactions with receptors that have imidazole binding sites, such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 2: The molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring, which could interact with certain G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Notably, this might relate to serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), as they often have pyrrolidine-like structures in their ligand-binding domains.
Step 3: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) indicates the molecule may be an inhibitor or activator of enzymes involved in drug metabolism. Specifically, it could interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are key players in the metabolism of many drugs.
Step 4: The molecule also has a naphthalene ring, which could potentially interact with proteins involved in signaling pathways, such as HRH1 (histamine receptor H1) and KDR (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2).
Step 5: Considering the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HRH1, KDR. 
Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HRH1, KDR.
