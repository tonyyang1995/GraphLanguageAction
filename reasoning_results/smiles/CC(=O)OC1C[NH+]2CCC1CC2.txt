Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this relationship might be important.
Step 1: The molecule is a chiral compound containing a benzene ring, an amide group (-CONH), and a phenethylamine moiety. The presence of a phenethylamine group suggests potential interactions with receptors that have similar structural features.
Step 2: The phenethylamine moiety is known to interact with several G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), including adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 3: Additionally, the amide group could potentially interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as cytochrome P450s (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Step 4: The molecule also has a quinolone-like structure, which may interact with kinases like LCK and CDK2.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure, the molecule is likely to be related to the genes ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, LCK, and CDK2.
