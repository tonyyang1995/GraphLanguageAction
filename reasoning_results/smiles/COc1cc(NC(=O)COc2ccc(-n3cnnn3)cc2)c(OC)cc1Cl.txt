Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc(NC(=O)COc2ccc(-n3cnnn3)cc2)c(OC)cc1Cl, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule containing a benzene ring system, a cyano group (-CN), a nitro group (-NO2), and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This structure suggests the molecule has potential to interact with proteins involved in signal transduction, ion transport, and receptor activity.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of a carboxylic acid group could indicate the molecule may act as an agonist or antagonist for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as adrenergic and muscarinic receptors, which are encoded by several of the listed genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and HTR2A-HTR2C. GPCRs often have binding sites for small molecules that modulate their function.
Step 3: Additionally, the benzene ring system with attached functional groups might suggest the molecule could be an inhibitor of enzymes such as CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism. These genes encode enzymes that oxidize various substrates, including drugs, and alterations in their activity can affect pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.
Step 4: The molecule's structure also hints at possible interactions with ion channels, particularly those encoded by KCNH2, which encodes the HERG potassium channel, and PTGS1, which encodes cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), an enzyme involved in prostaglandin synthesis. Both ion channels and COX-1 are known to be targets for certain pharmaceutical compounds.
Step 5: Given the complexity and functional groups present in the molecule, it is likely to have multiple modes of action and potentially interact with a few key genes rather than just one. The related genes include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, KCNH2, and PTGS1.
Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, KCNH2, PTGS1.
