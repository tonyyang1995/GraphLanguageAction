Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cccc(-n2nnc3cnn(C)c3c2=O)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule provided is a complex organic compound that includes aromatic rings, heteroatoms (nitrogens), and a cyclic nitro group (-n2nnc3cnn(C)c3c2=O). This structure suggests it could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors due to its diverse functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of multiple nitrogen atoms and a nitro group indicates potential interactions with proteins that contain binding sites for such functional groups, particularly enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYP family) which are known to metabolize drugs and other xenobiotics.
Step 3: Considering the molecular structure, it is likely to interact with genes encoding for drug-metabolizing enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. These enzymes play crucial roles in the metabolism of various drugs, including those used for pain management, psychiatric conditions, and cardiovascular diseases.
Step 4: The cyclic nitro group and overall structure might also suggest potential interaction with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or ion channels, which could relate to genes like DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, and KCNH2, involved in neurotransmission and ion transport.
Step 5: Given the above structural features, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, and KCNH2.
