Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(N(C)C(=O)c2ccc3nc(-c4ccccc4)c(-c4ccccc4)nc3c2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a tricyclic core with a nitrogen atom, suggesting it may be an antidepressant or similar compound. This structure is common in molecules that interact with neurotransmitter receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and a quinoline moiety indicates potential interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2D6 and CYP2C9, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a pyrrolidine group, which could indicate interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as HTR2A and HTR2B, which are involved in serotonin signaling.
Step 4: The presence of a morphinan-like structure, with a central ring system, suggests possible interactions with opioid receptors, specifically OPRK1, which is part of the cannabinoid receptor family.
Step 5: Based on the structural features, the molecule is likely to interact with several genes including CYP2D6, CYP2C9, HTR2A, HTR2B, and OPRK1.
