Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(CC(=O)Nc2cccc(-c3nnc(-c4ccco4)o3)c2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that includes a benzene ring, a carboxamide group, and a nitrogen atom involved in a heterocyclic ring. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes and receptors involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of a carboxamide group and a benzene ring indicates this molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes such as CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: The nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring may also interact with receptors like HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A), which is part of the serotonergic system, and DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), which is involved in dopamine signaling pathways.
Step 4: Given the complexity and specific functional groups, this molecule might not directly relate to all listed genes but could have significant interactions with those involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmission.
Step 5: Therefore, the related genes are: CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, DRD2.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- HTR2A
- DRD2 Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that includes a benzene ring, a carboxamide group, and a nitrogen atom involved in a heterocyclic ring.

Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group and a benzene ring indicates this molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes such as CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics.
- DRD2
Note: The gene CYP2C19 was initially considered but was not mentioned in the final summary due to the focus on more direct interactions based on the molecule's structure. However, it could also be relevant depending on additional experimental evidence.
