Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C=CC(=O)Nc1cc(N=c2nc(-c3cn(C)c4ccccc34)cc[n-]2)c(OC)cc1N(C)CC[NH+](C)C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this might be important.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with a ketone group and a nitrogen atom with a positive charge. This structural feature suggests potential interactions with enzymes that metabolize drugs or chemicals, such as those encoded by CYP (Cytochrome P450) genes, particularly CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a pyrrolidine ring, which may interact with receptors that have similar structural features, such as HTR2A (5-HT2A receptor). This interaction could modulate serotonin signaling pathways.
Step 3: The presence of a nitrile group (-CN) and a phenylacetylene moiety indicates potential binding sites for proteins involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, and CHRM1-4. These interactions could affect adrenergic and cholinergic signaling.
Step 4: The molecule has a quinolone-like structure, which could interact with DNA topoisomerases, potentially affecting genes involved in cell cycle regulation, such as CDK2.
Step 5: The molecule also contains a pyridine ring, which may interact with enzymes like CYP1A2, suggesting possible metabolism-related effects.
