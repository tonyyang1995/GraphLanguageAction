Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)c1nnn(-c2no[n-]c2=N)c1-c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with a carboxamide group attached to it. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP (cytochrome P450) genes. 
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the carboxamide group and the overall molecular shape could indicate binding affinity for receptors like GPCRs (G protein-coupled receptors). Genes encoding such receptors include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 3: The aromatic nature of the molecule and its ability to form hydrogen bonds due to the oxygen and nitrogen atoms suggest possible interactions with ion channels and transporters. Relevant genes here are KCNH2 and SLC6A4.
Step 4: The molecule's overall size and shape might allow it to interact with kinases, such as LCK, which is encoded by the LCK gene.
Step 5: Considering the presence of a nitro group and the overall structure, the molecule may have activity against enzymes like CYP2D6, which metabolizes many drugs and is encoded by the CYP2D6 gene.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, SLC6A4, LCK.
