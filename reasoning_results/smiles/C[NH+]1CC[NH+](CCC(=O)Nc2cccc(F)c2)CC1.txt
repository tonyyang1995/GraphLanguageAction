Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+]1CC[NH+](CCC(=O)Nc2cccc(F)c2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule containing several functional groups such as amine (NH2), amide (CONH), and aromatic rings. The presence of an amine group (-NH+) suggests the molecule could act as a ligand or inhibitor for receptors that have an affinity for basic compounds.
Step 2: The molecule also contains a carboxamide group (CONH) and an ester group (COOR), which are common in drugs that interact with ion channels, transporters, and enzymes. The ester group might be involved in reversible binding to proteins, while the carboxamide could form hydrogen bonds or participate in catalytic processes.
Step 3: Given the structure, this molecule could potentially interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to its amine and amide functionalities. GPCRs are often involved in signal transduction pathways and are regulated by various neurotransmitters and hormones. The molecule's potential interaction with GPCRs aligns with the presence of several GPCR-related genes in the list, including HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule’s structure includes an acetyl group (CONH2) and a benzene ring, which are known to modulate the activity of certain enzymes like cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP). This suggests the molecule may interact with CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which play crucial roles in drug metabolism.
Step 5: The presence of a benzene ring and amine groups also indicates the molecule could influence ion channels, particularly those involved in calcium signaling, such as CACNA1H, which encodes a voltage-gated calcium channel.
Summary of related gene names:
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6 (serotonin receptors)
- CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4 (cholinergic receptors)
- CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 (cytochrome P450 enzymes)
- CACNA1H (calcium channel)
