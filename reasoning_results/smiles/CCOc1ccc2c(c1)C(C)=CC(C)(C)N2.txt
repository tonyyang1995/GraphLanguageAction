Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOc1ccc2c(c1)C(C)=CC(C)(C)N2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a structure that includes a benzene ring (Phenyl) attached to a pyrrole ring, which is part of a larger complex structure. This type of molecular structure often interacts with receptors or enzymes that are involved in signal transduction pathways and neurotransmitter metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule, specifically within the pyrrole ring, suggests potential interactions with receptors that have amine binding sites. This could include G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as adrenergic and cholinergic receptors, which are encoded by genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in the molecule could indicate potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolic pathways, such as those encoded by CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). These enzymes are known to metabolize various drugs and endogenous compounds.
Step 4: The overall structure also hints at possible interactions with transporters and ion channels, such as those encoded by KCNH2 (a potassium channel) and SIGMAR1 (sigma receptor), which might be involved in modulating neuronal activity.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and potential interactions, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, KCNH2, and SIGMAR1.
