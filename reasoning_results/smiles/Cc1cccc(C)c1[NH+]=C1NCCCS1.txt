Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cccc(C)c1[NH+]=C1NCCCS1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a tricyclic core structure with a nitrogen atom in the ring, which is characteristic of many ligands that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature suggests potential interactions with receptors such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4, all of which are GPCRs involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in the molecule indicates potential activity against enzymes like CYP2E1, though it is not listed among the provided genes. However, given the similarity in chemical structure, the molecule may indirectly affect enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are part of the cytochrome P450 family.
Step 3: The molecule includes a benzene ring with an amide group (-CONH-), which could indicate interactions with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways. This structural feature might relate to the gene HTR1A, which encodes a serotonin receptor, as well as other HTR genes (HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) that are also involved in neurotransmission.
Step 4: The presence of a sulfur-containing group (sulfide) in the molecule suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in calcium signaling, such as CACNA1H. This structural element could also be relevant to the gene PTGS1, which encodes cyclooxygenase-1, an enzyme involved in prostaglandin synthesis and inflammation.
Step 5: Given the overall structure and functional groups present in the molecule, it is most likely to have significant interactions with genes involved in neurotransmission, signal transduction, and drug metabolism. Therefore, the related gene names are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, CACNA1H, PTGS1. Step 5: Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, CACNA1H, PTGS1.
