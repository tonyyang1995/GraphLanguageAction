Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])CCC(=O)c1ccc(-c2ccccc2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a structure that includes an aromatic ring system and a carboxylic acid group, which are common in ligands for various receptors and transporters.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (COOH) suggests potential interactions with ion channels or receptors that have acidic binding sites, such as voltage-gated potassium channels (e.g., KCNH2) and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The aromatic ring system and the presence of oxygen atoms (-O-) indicate possible interactions with enzymes that metabolize drugs, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes (e.g., CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are known to oxidize aromatic compounds.
Step 4: Given the molecule's structure, it may also interact with receptors involved in neurotransmission, such as dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), due to the presence of functional groups that could bind to these receptors.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4. Step 5: Summary of Related Gene Names:
