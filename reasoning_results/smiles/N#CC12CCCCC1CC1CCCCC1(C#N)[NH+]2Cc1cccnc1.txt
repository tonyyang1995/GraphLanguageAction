Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N#CC12CCCCC1CC1CCCCC1(C#N)[NH+]2Cc1cccnc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure including a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (indicated by "N#C") and multiple aromatic rings connected through carbon atoms. The presence of a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (indicated by "[NH+]2") suggests the molecule may act as an agonist or modulator of receptors that interact with positively charged amino acid residues.
Step 2: The pattern of aromatic rings and the presence of a nitro group (indicated by "N#C") are typical features of compounds that can interact with enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways, such as kinases. This structural feature aligns with the involvement of several genes in signaling processes, including CDK2, LCK, and KDR.
Step 3: The presence of a quinolone-like structure (indicated by "Cc1cccnc1") is characteristic of molecules that can act as agonists or antagonists for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This is relevant to genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode for various types of GPCRs.
Step 4: The molecule also contains a pyrrole ring system, which is known to be involved in binding to certain nuclear receptors, such as those encoded by NR1H2 (which is homologous to CACNA1H) and NR1H3. However, there are no direct matches in the provided list of genes.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule appears to have potential interactions with genes involved in signal transduction (e.g., CDK2, LCK, KDR), receptor activity (e.g., ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), and possibly some enzymes involved in drug metabolism (e.g., CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6).
