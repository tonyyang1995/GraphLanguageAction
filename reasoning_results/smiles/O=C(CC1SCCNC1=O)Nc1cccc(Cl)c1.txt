Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(CC1SCCNC1=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule provided has a complex structure with several functional groups including an amide, carbonyl, thiol, and aromatic rings. Notably, it contains a quinoline-like core and a thiophene ring fused to a pyrrole ring, which are common in many bioactive molecules.
Step 2: Given the presence of a quinoline core, this molecule could potentially interact with enzymes that metabolize quinoline-containing compounds, such as CYP2D6, which is involved in the metabolism of a wide range of drugs and endogenous substances.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a thiol group (-SH) suggests the molecule might have redox activity or could interact with thiols in proteins, which could be relevant to genes involved in redox signaling or protein thiolation processes, such as PTGS1 (COX-2), which encodes an enzyme involved in prostaglandin synthesis.
Step 4: The aromatic rings and amide functionalities indicate potential interactions with receptors or ion channels, particularly those involved in neurotransmission, such as HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A) and KCNH2 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2).
Step 5: Considering the above structural features, the molecule may be related to the following genes: CYP2D6, PTGS1, HTR2A, and KCNH2.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2D6
- PTGS1
- HTR2A
- KCNH2
These genes are related to drug metabolism, prostaglandin synthesis, serotonin receptor function, and potassium channel function, respectively. The molecule's structure hints at its potential interaction with these biological pathways. **End**. No further explanation needed beyond summarizing the related genes. \[Note: The SMILES string provided does not directly correspond to any known drug or compound with established genetic associations, so the relationships described here are speculative based on the molecule's structure.]\] \[End\]
