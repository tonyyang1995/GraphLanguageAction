Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(-c2ncc(Cl)cc2-c2ccc(S(C)(=O)=O)cc2)cn1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings and functional groups including a pyrrole ring, a benzene ring, and a sulfonamide group (-S(C)(=O)=O). This suggests the molecule may interact with enzymes or receptors that have similar structural requirements for binding.
Step 2: The presence of a sulfonamide group (-S(C)(=O)=O) indicates the molecule could be an inhibitor of enzymes involved in drug metabolism such as those encoded by CYP (cytochrome P450) genes. Specifically, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 are known to metabolize drugs containing sulfonamides.
Step 3: The aromatic and heteroaromatic structures present in the molecule might interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are encoded by genes like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, all of which are dopamine receptors.
Step 4: The overall size and shape of the molecule suggest it could fit into the binding pockets of certain ion channels or transporters. For example, SLC6A2 (noradrenaline transporter) and SLC6A4 (serotonin transporter) could potentially bind this molecule, given their roles in neurotransmitter reuptake.
Step 5: Considering the interactions with enzymes and receptors, the most relevant genes are CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4. These genes encode proteins that could directly interact with or be affected by the molecule through metabolic pathways or receptor activation. 
Summary of related genes: CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
