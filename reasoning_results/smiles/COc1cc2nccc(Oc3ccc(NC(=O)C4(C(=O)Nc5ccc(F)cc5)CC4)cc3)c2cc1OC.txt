Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc2nccc(Oc3ccc(NC(=O)C4(C(=O)Nc5ccc(F)cc5)CC4)cc3)c2cc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with functional groups such as amides (N-C=O), nitriles (C#N), and an oxygen-containing heterocycle (e.g., pyrrole). The presence of an amide group (C=O bonded to N) suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, particularly those encoded by CYP enzymes.
Step 2: The molecule contains a nitrile group (C#N) and a phenolic hydroxyl group (O-H), which could indicate potential binding sites for enzymes involved in phase I reactions, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs). This further supports the involvement of CYP-related genes like CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 3: The presence of a pyrrole ring system and a benzene ring with multiple substituents (including fluorine) may suggest ligand binding to receptors that interact with neurotransmitters or hormones, which are often encoded by genes such as DRD2, HTR1A, and SIGMAR1.
Step 4: The overall structure, with its aromatic rings and functional groups, might also hint at interactions with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are encoded by genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, and ADRB2, due to the presence of functional groups that could mimic agonists or antagonists of these receptors.
Step 5: Considering the above structural features, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and receptor binding (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, HTR1A, SIGMAR1).
