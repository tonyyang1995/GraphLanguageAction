Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(CCc1ccccc1)[NH2+]CC(O)c1ccc([O-])c(C(N)=O)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains several functional groups such as amine (NH2+), hydroxyl (-OH), carboxyl (-COOH), and cyclic structures. The presence of an amine group suggests potential interactions with receptors that have complementary binding sites, particularly those involved in neurotransmission.
Step 2: The cyclic structure with multiple rings (e.g., benzene rings) and the presence of oxygen and nitrogen heteroatoms indicate the molecule could act as a ligand for receptors or enzymes that interact with aromatic compounds and nucleophiles. This includes receptors and enzymes associated with signal transduction pathways.
Step 3: The molecule also has a carboxyl group, which is often involved in interactions with proteins and enzymes through hydrogen bonding and other electrostatic interactions. This could be relevant to enzymes like CYP2D6, which metabolizes many drugs and xenobiotics via oxidation reactions involving carboxyl groups.
Step 4: Given the diverse functional groups and structural complexity, this molecule might interact with multiple targets, including but not limited to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and cytochrome P450 enzymes. Specifically, it could interact with genes encoding for CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and HTR2A, which codes for a serotonin receptor.
Step 5: Additionally, the presence of a carboxylate group (-COO-) and the overall molecular structure suggest potential interaction with ion channels, which could relate to genes like KCNH2, encoding the HERG potassium channel, and SLC6A4, encoding the serotonin transporter.

The molecule is likely to interact with several genes, primarily those involved in drug metabolism (CYP enzymes) and neurotransmission (serotonin receptors and ion channels). These interactions are due to the presence of functional groups like amine, hydroxyl, carboxyl, and the overall molecular structure. The detailed relationship between the molecule and the related genes is based on the potential for ligand-receptor interactions and metabolic pathways. The listed genes are those most directly influenced by the molecule's chemical properties.
