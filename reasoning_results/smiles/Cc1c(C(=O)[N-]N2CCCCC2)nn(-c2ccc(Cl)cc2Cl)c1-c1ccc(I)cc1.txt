Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1c(C(=O)[N-]N2CCCCC2)nn(-c2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl)c1-c1ccc(I)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with multiple substituents, including an acetyl group, a nitrogen atom with a negative charge, and halogen atoms (chlorine). These structural features suggest that the molecule could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways or transport mechanisms.
Step 2: The presence of the acetyl group and the negatively charged nitrogen atom indicates that this molecule might be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors. For example, it could potentially inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The chlorine atoms and the iodine atom suggest that the molecule could have affinity for proteins containing halogen-binding sites or could be recognized by receptors that interact with halogenated ligands. This could include receptors like adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) or cholinergic receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 4: Given the complexity of the molecule, it could also interact with ion channels or transporters. The presence of multiple functional groups and the overall size of the molecule indicate potential interactions with proteins such as G protein-coupled receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) or voltage-gated potassium channels (KCNH2).
Step 5: Considering the molecule's diverse functional groups and potential interactions with various proteins, the most likely related genes are those involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), adrenergic signaling (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), cholinergic signaling (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), and neurotransmitter receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
