Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(c1ccc(OCC[NH+]2CCCCC2)cc1)c1c(-c2ccc([O-])cc2)sc2cc([O-])ccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring system, an imidazole ring, and multiple substituents such as hydroxyl (-OH), amine (-NH2), and carboxyl (-COOH) groups. These structural features suggest that the molecule could interact with proteins involved in neurotransmission and receptor binding.
Step 2: Notably, the molecule includes a carboxyl group and amine functionalities, which are common in ligands for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are known to be regulated by various factors, including the expression and activity of enzymes like CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs and endogenous compounds.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a benzene ring and amine group suggests potential interactions with ion channels, such as those encoded by KCNH2 (hERG potassium channel), which may be modulated by the molecule's structure. Ion channels are also influenced by the expression and function of other genes like KDR (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2).
Step 4: The molecule's overall structure and functional groups hint at its possible role in modulating neurotransmitter release and signaling pathways, which are critical for the function of several genes involved in neuronal communication and behavior, such as HTR2A (serotonin 5-HT2A receptor) and DRD2 (dopamine D2 receptor).
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structural features and inferred biological activities, the related genes include: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, KCNH2, KDR, HTR2A, and DRD2.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, KCNH2, KDR, HTR2A, DRD2.
