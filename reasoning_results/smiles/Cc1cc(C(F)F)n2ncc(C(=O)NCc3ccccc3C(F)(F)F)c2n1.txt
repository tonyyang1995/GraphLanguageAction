Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc(C(F)F)n2ncc(C(=O)NCc3ccccc3C(F)(F)F)c2n1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains multiple functional groups such as phenyl rings, fluorine atoms, and a carbonyl group. These structural features suggest potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for aromatic compounds or functional groups like carboxylic acids.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and fluorinated substituents indicates possible interaction with enzymes or receptors involved in drug metabolism or transport, which are encoded by genes such as CYP (cytochrome P450) family members and ABC transporters.
Step 3: The presence of a carboxylic acid group could indicate a potential ligand for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly those involved in neurotransmission or hormone signaling, such as DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), HTR (serotonin receptors), and CHRM (cholinergic receptors).
Step 4: The overall structure suggests the molecule may interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, such as kinases (e.g., LCK) and receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g., KDR), due to its size and hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure, the most likely related genes are: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ABCB1, ABL1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KDR, LCK, OPRK1, and SLC6A4. Step 5: Related Gene Names: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ABCB1, ABL1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KDR, LCK, OPRK1, SLC6A4.
