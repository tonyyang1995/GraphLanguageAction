Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc(=NC(=O)Nc2ccc(N(C)C)cc2)c2cc(F)cc(F)c2[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure containing a benzene ring (Cc1cc), a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (Nc2ccc(N(C)C)cc2), and fluorine substituents (F). These features suggest that the molecule may interact with proteins involved in neurotransmission and receptor signaling.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of a nitro group (-NO2) and amide functionality (Nc2ccc(N(C)C)cc2) indicates potential interactions with enzymes or receptors that contain amino acid residues or specific functional groups that can form hydrogen bonds or electrostatic interactions with these functional groups.
Step 3: Given the structural elements of the molecule, it could potentially modulate the activity of receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds and stabilize receptor conformations.
Step 4: The molecule might also have an impact on G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4) because of its size and chemical functionality, which could allow it to bind to the extracellular domains of these receptors.
Step 5: Based on the analysis, the molecule appears to be related to several genes involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways, including: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4. These genes encode receptors and enzymes that are likely to be affected by the molecule's structure and functional groups.
