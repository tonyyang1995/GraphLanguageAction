Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(C(=O)Nc2cc3c(cc2OC)CCCC3)cc1Br, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex molecule containing a benzene ring system, an indole ring, and several functional groups such as a carbonyl group (-CO), a nitro group (-NO2), and a bromine atom (-Br). The presence of a benzene ring and a heterocyclic indole ring suggests that this molecule could interact with proteins involved in signaling pathways and transport mechanisms.
Step 2: The molecule contains a carboxamide group (-CONH2), which is often found in ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other receptor proteins. This functional group indicates potential interactions with genes encoding GPCRs and enzymes involved in signal transduction.
Step 3: The bromine atom (-Br) attached to the benzene ring could participate in halogen-bonding interactions, which are important for the binding of certain molecules to their target proteins. This feature may suggest interactions with genes encoding ion channels or transporters that utilize halogen-bonding interactions.
Step 4: Considering the presence of a nitro group (-NO2) and the overall structure of the molecule, it might be a substrate for enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize drugs and xenobiotics. These enzymes are encoded by the CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 genes, respectively.
Step 5: Given the structural complexity and the presence of functional groups that could interact with receptors and enzymes, the molecule might be related to the following genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode serotonin receptors, and CYP3A4, which encodes a cytochrome P450 enzyme involved in drug metabolism.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- HTR6
- CYP3A4
Note: The gene CYP1A2 is not included in the summary as its primary function is to metabolize xenobiotics, and there is no clear indication from the molecule's structure that it would interact with this gene. Similarly, other genes listed do not have direct evidence of interaction based on the provided molecule's structure. However, the presence of a carboxamide group suggests potential interactions with some of the listed genes, particularly those encoding serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) and the CYP enzymes mentioned. Other genes were not specifically indicated as having a clear relationship based on the provided information.
