Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)CSc1nc(=N)c2c3c(sc2[n-]1)CCC3, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule has a core structure of a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group attached to it. This indicates potential interaction with proteins that have carboxylic acid binding sites, such as enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a sulfonamide group (S=O) suggests the molecule could interact with proteins that have sulfhydryl or thiol groups, which are common in cysteine-containing proteins like kinases and receptors.
Step 3: The cyclic amine structure (Nc(=N)c) implies the molecule might bind to proteins with similar functional groups, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other ion channels.
Step 4: Given the structural features, the molecule could potentially interact with genes encoding for enzymes involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule may interact with genes encoding for kinases (ABL1, LCK), ion channels (CACNA1H, KCNH2), and transporters (SLC6A2, SLC6A4).
