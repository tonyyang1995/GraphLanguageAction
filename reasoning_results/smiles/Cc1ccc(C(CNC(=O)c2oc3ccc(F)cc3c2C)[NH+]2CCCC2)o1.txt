Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(C(CNC(=O)c2oc3ccc(F)cc3c2C)[NH+]2CCCC2)o1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with various substituents such as a trifluoromethyl group (F), a cyano group (-CN), and an amide group (-CONH2). This complex aromatic structure suggests that the molecule could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction, receptor binding, or enzymatic activity due to its diverse functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group and a trifluoromethyl group indicates potential for interaction with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. These enzymes are known to metabolize drugs through oxidation processes, and the substituents could serve as substrates or inhibitors.
Step 3: The amide group present in the molecule might be relevant to receptors or ion channels that bind ligands containing amide functionalities, such as HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A), HTR2B (serotonin receptor 2B), HTR2C (serotonin receptor 2C), and HTR6 (serotonin receptor 6).
Step 4: Given the overall structure and functional groups, the molecule could potentially modulate G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), DRD3 (dopamine receptor D3), and DRD4 (dopamine receptor D4), which are known to have amine or amide-containing ligands.
Step 5: The complex aromatic structure and presence of a nitroso group suggest possible interactions with enzymes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism, such as PTGS1 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1), which is involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins.
