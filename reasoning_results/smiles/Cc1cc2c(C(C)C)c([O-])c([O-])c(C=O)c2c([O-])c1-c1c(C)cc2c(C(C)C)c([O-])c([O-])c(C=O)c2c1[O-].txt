Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex molecule, likely a small organic compound. Upon inspection, this molecule contains several functional groups such as amides (C=O), esters (C-O-C), and carboxylic acids (C-OH). Notably, it has multiple cyclic structures and is negatively charged due to the presence of multiple oxygen atoms with negative charges ([O-]).
Step 2: Given the complexity and the presence of functional groups like amides and esters, this molecule could potentially interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways or enzyme activities. Specifically, the presence of amide and ester groups suggests that the molecule might be an inhibitor or substrate for enzymes or receptors.
Step 3: Considering the pattern of the molecule and its functional groups, it is plausible that this molecule could interact with receptors that bind ligands with similar functional groups. For example, the presence of amide and ester groups might suggest interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which often bind lipophilic molecules.
Step 4: Based on the functional group analysis, the molecule could be related to GPCRs, which are known to interact with various ligands including small molecules with amide and ester functionalities. Some of the genes listed are known to encode GPCRs, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These receptors are involved in neurotransmission and hormone signaling.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes encode GPCRs that may interact with the molecule through their binding sites, potentially affecting their activity or function.
