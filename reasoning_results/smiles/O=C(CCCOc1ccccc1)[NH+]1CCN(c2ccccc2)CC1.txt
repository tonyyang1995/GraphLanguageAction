Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(CCCOc1ccccc1)[NH+]1CCN(c2ccccc2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a central carbon chain with various functional groups such as an amide (N-C), an ester (C=O), a phenolic hydroxyl group (OH), and a positively charged nitrogen (NH+). These functional groups suggest that the molecule could interact with proteins involved in signaling pathways, transport, or metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of an aromatic ring system and a positively charged nitrogen indicate potential interactions with receptors that have similar structures, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or ion channels. For instance, the positively charged nitrogen might allow for cationic interactions with negatively charged residues in receptor binding sites.
Step 3: The molecule's structure suggests it could be a ligand for multiple GPCRs, which are known to be regulated by various genes listed. For example, the presence of an aromatic ring and a hydrophobic core is characteristic of ligands for adrenergic receptors (e.g., ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (e.g., CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure hints at possible interactions with enzymes that metabolize drugs or other molecules, such as those encoded by CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These cytochrome P450 enzymes play a crucial role in drug metabolism and could be affected by the presence of this molecule.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6. These genes encode receptors and enzymes that may be directly or indirectly influenced by the molecule's structure and properties. Step 5: Related Gene List: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6. 
These genes encode receptors and enzymes that may be directly or indirectly influenced by the molecule's structure and properties. The detailed reasoning is based on the presence of functional groups in the molecule that are known to interact with these specific types of proteins.
