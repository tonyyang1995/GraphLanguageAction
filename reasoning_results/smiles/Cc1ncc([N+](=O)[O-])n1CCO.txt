Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound that includes a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (azole) connected to an aromatic ring, which is typical for many drug molecules. The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) and a carbonyl group (-CO) are key functional groups often involved in binding to enzymes and receptors.
Step 2: The molecule contains a quinoline-like structure with a positively charged nitrogen atom and a negatively charged oxygen atom, which suggests it could interact with ion channels or transporters. This feature is particularly relevant to the SLC6A4 gene, which encodes the serotonin transporter, and the OPRK1 gene, which codes for the opioid receptor.
Step 3: The molecule also has a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which can participate in hydrogen bonding and other interactions with proteins. These functionalities are important for binding to enzymes such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule, with its diverse functional groups and potential for forming multiple types of interactions, indicates that it could have effects on multiple genes involved in neurotransmitter transport and metabolism, including DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and PTGS1.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: SLC6A4, OPRK1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and PTGS1.
