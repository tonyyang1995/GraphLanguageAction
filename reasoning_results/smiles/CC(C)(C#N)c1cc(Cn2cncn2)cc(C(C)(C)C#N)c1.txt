Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)(C#N)c1cc(Cn2cncn2)cc(C(C)(C)C#N)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom double-bonded to a carbon (C#N), which suggests it may be an amide or a nitrile compound. This structural feature is often found in ligands that interact with receptors, particularly G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 2: The presence of multiple aromatic rings (indicated by the benzene rings) and heteroatoms (such as nitrogen and oxygen) suggests the molecule could potentially act as a ligand for receptors that recognize such structural elements, including GPCRs.
Step 3: Notably, several of the listed genes encode for GPCRs, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, and KDR. These receptors are known to bind small molecules and play roles in various physiological processes, such as neurotransmission and hormone signaling.
Step 4: Given the potential for the molecule to interact with GPCR ligand binding sites, it is plausible that it could have an affinity for one or more of these genes' encoded proteins.
Step 5: Therefore, the related genes to this molecule include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, and KDR. 
Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, KDR.
