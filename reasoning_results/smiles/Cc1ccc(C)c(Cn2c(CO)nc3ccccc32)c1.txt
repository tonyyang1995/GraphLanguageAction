Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(C)c(Cn2c(CO)nc3ccccc32)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule has a complex structure with aromatic rings, heteroatoms like nitrogen and oxygen, and a benzene ring containing a cyano group (-CN). This structure suggests it could interact with receptors that bind small molecules, particularly those involving nitrogen-containing groups and hydrophobic regions.
Step 2: Analyzing the pattern of the molecule, we notice that it contains a tricyclic core, which is characteristic of certain ligands that can interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This feature is indicative of potential interactions with genes encoding GPCRs such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4, all of which encode for different subtypes of adrenergic and cholinergic receptors.
Step 3: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) in the molecule might also suggest its potential interaction with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize various drugs including those with similar chemical structures.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's overall structure could indicate a possible interaction with ion channels or transporters, given the presence of charged functional groups and the overall hydrophobicity. Genes like KCNH2 (a potassium channel) and SLC6A4 (a neurotransmitter transporter) could be relevant here.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structural features and the above analysis, the genes potentially related to this molecule include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, KCNH2, and SLC6A4. These genes encode proteins that could interact with or be influenced by the molecule's pharmacological profile. 
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, KCNH2, SLC6A4.
