Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1c(-c2ccccc2)oc2c(C(=O)OCC[NH+]3CCCCC3)cccc2c1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings and functional groups, including a pyrrolidine ring, a benzene ring, and a carboxylic acid group. The presence of these structural elements suggests that the molecule may interact with proteins involved in signal transduction, ion transport, or enzymatic activities.
Step 2: Notably, the carboxylic acid group could potentially bind to acidic residues on protein surfaces, while the aromatic rings might form hydrogen bonds or π-π stacking interactions. This type of molecular interaction is common for ligands binding to receptors and enzymes.
Step 3: Considering the genes provided, several are known to encode receptors or enzymes that might interact with such a molecule. For instance, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, and CHRM1-4 encode adrenergic and cholinergic receptors, which often have binding sites for small molecules. Additionally, CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) are drug-metabolizing enzymes that could interact with this molecule during pharmacological processes.
Step 4: Furthermore, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 encode serotonin receptors, which are known to interact with various ligands, including small molecules. These receptors are involved in neurotransmission and could be potential targets for the described molecule.
Step 5: Given the complexity and potential binding sites of the molecule, it is likely to be related to multiple genes rather than just one. However, based on the provided information, the genes that could be most directly related to this molecule are those encoding receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1-4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) and enzymes involved in metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
