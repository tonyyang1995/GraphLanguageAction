Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCc1n[n-]c(=NC(=O)C2CC[NH+](C(=O)NC3CCCCC3)CC2)s1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound with multiple functional groups including an amide group (-CONH), a cyano group (CN), and a nitro group (N[double bond]N). These functional groups are indicative of the molecule's potential for interaction with various proteins and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group suggests that the molecule may interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are known to metabolize compounds containing similar functional groups.
Step 3: The amide group (-CONH) indicates that the molecule could potentially bind to receptors or ion channels, particularly those involved in neurotransmission. For example, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are serotonin receptors, could be potential targets due to their amine binding sites.
Step 4: The nitro group (N[double bond]N) might also contribute to the molecule's ability to interact with certain receptors, such as DRD2, which is a dopamine receptor. Dopamine receptors often have binding sites that can accommodate electron-withdrawing groups like the nitro group.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and functional groups identified, the molecule could be related to several genes involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism, including CYP2C9, CYP2C19, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and DRD2.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2. Step 1: The molecule contains a cyano group (CN) and an amide group (-CONH), which are common functional groups in drug molecules. These groups suggest potential interactions with biological systems.
Step 2: The cyano group (CN) is likely to interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which metabolize compounds with this functional group.
Step 3: The amide group (-CONH) suggests possible binding to receptors or ion channels, particularly those involved in neurotransmission, like HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C.
Step 4: The presence of a nitro group (N[double bond]N) might allow the molecule to interact with receptors such as DRD2, which has binding sites for electron-withdrawing groups.
Step 5: Considering the structural features, the molecule could be related to genes involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism, specifically CYP2C9, CYP2C19, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and DRD2.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2. Step 1: The molecule contains a cyano group (CN) and an amide group (-CONH), which are common in drugs interacting with enzymes and receptors.
Step 2: The cyano group (CN) is often metabolized by CYP enzymes, particularly CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, suggesting a relationship with these
