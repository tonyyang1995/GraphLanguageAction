Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(-c2cc(C(=O)[NH+]3CCN(c4ccc(F)cc4)CC3)c3ccccc3n2)o1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with several functional groups including aromatic rings, amide bonds, and a nitrogen atom with a positive charge. This structure suggests the molecule may interact with proteins that have binding sites for similar chemical moieties.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (C(=O)[NH+]3) indicates potential interaction with receptors or enzymes that recognize such functional groups, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The nitrogen atom with a positive charge (+) might interact with anions or negatively charged residues in protein binding sites, which could be relevant to GPCRs and other ion channel receptors.
Step 4: Given the potential for interaction with GPCRs and enzymes involved in drug metabolism, the molecule could be related to genes encoding these proteins. Specifically, it may interact with GPCRs such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, as well as enzymes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.
Step 5: The molecule may also interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, such as PTGS1, which codes for COX-2, an enzyme involved in inflammation and pain.
