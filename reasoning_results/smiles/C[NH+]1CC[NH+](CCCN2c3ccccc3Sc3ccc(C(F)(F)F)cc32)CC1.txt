Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+]1CC[NH+](CCCN2c3ccccc3Sc3ccc(C(F)(F)F)cc32)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple functional groups such as amine (NH+) and phenyl rings. It also has a number of substituents like fluoro-substituted benzene rings, which are common in drug molecules designed to interact with receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: Notably, the molecule contains amine groups (-NH+) which are characteristic of compounds that can act as ligands for various receptor proteins. Specifically, these amine groups could potentially bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are known to be regulated by numerous genes in the provided list.
Step 3: Among the listed genes, several are involved in encoding GPCRs or are associated with signaling pathways that include GPCRs. These include HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, and SIGMAR1. These genes encode for receptors that respond to neurotransmitters and hormones, which could interact with the amine group of the molecule.
Step 4: Furthermore, the presence of fluoro-substituted benzene rings in the molecule might suggest it has the potential to modulate cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP enzymes), specifically CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs and are listed among the given genes.
Step 5: Therefore, the molecule may have interactions with multiple genes, but the primary potential interactions are with those encoding GPCRs and enzymes involved in drug metabolism. The related gene names are:
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- DRD2, DRD3, DRD4
- ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2
- CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4
- HRH1
- SIGMAR1
- CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6
These genes are relevant due to their roles in neurotransmitter and hormone signaling as well as drug metabolism.
