Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COC(=O)C([NH3+])CCC[NH+]=C(N)N[N+](=O)[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this might be important.
Step 1: The molecule has a structure that includes a benzene ring (Phenyl) attached to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an amide group (-CONH2). This suggests it could interact with proteins involved in transport, metabolism, or receptor binding.
Step 2: The presence of an amine group (-NH2) and its protonated form (-NH3+) indicates potential interactions with proteins containing ion channels or receptors that have amine-binding sites, such as adrenergic and muscarinic receptors.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a pyrrolidine ring and a quinoline ring, which are known to be involved in ligand binding and can interact with enzymes or receptors that recognize similar structural motifs.
Step 4: Given the structural features, particularly the amine groups and the carboxylic acid, the molecule could potentially interact with enzymes such as CYP2D6 and CYP2C9, which are involved in drug metabolism and can bind to molecules with similar functional groups.
Step 5: The molecule may also interact with receptors like HTR2A (Serotonin 5-HT2A receptor), HTR2B (Serotonin 5-HT2B receptor), and HTR2C (Serotonin 5-HT2C receptor) due to the presence of amine groups that can form hydrogen bonds and other interactions with the receptor's binding site.
