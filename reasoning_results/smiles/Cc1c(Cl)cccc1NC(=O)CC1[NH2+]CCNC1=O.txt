Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1c(Cl)cccc1NC(=O)CC1[NH2+]CCNC1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a benzene ring with multiple substituents including a chlorine atom, an amide group (-CONH2), and a cyano group (-CN). These structural features suggest that the molecule may interact with enzymes involved in metabolism, transport, or signaling pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group and amide group indicates potential for interaction with enzymes like CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize drugs containing these functional groups. Additionally, the presence of a benzene ring with a chlorine substituent could indicate a possible interaction with ABCB1, a gene encoding P-glycoprotein, which is involved in drug efflux.
Step 3: The amide group in the molecule also suggests a potential interaction with receptors such as HTR2A and HTR2B, which are G-protein coupled receptors involved in serotonin signaling. The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH2) is particularly relevant for receptor binding.
Step 4: Given the complexity of the molecule, it is less likely to have a direct relationship with other genes listed, such as those encoding kinases (e.g., LCK, CDK2), growth factors (e.g., KDR, FLT1), or transcription factors (e.g., PPARG, ESR1).
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the most likely related genes are CYP2C19, CYP2D6, ABCB1, HTR2A, and HTR2B.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- ABCB1
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
These genes are directly or indirectly involved in metabolic processes, transport, and neurotransmitter signaling, which aligns with the molecular features of the compound. Other genes listed are less likely to be directly related due to the lack of corresponding structural motifs or mechanisms in the molecule.
