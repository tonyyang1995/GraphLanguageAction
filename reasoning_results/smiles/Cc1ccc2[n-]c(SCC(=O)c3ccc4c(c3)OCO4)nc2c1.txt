Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc2[n-]c(SCC(=O)c3ccc4c(c3)OCO4)nc2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a nitrogen atom carrying a negative charge, which is characteristic of a quinolone-like structure. This pattern is commonly found in drugs that interact with various receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) and an ester (CO) suggests that this molecule could be an inhibitor or substrate for enzymes involved in metabolism such as cytochrome P450s (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are known to metabolize many drugs and are encoded by the corresponding genes.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a thioether (S-C) bond, which can form covalent bonds with proteins, potentially affecting protein-protein interactions and thus influencing the activity of enzymes like those encoded by the genes ABL1 and KDR, which are involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule might interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to its size and functional groups, particularly with receptors encoded by genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HRH1, which are known to be involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways.
Step 5: Given the above structural features, the molecule is likely to have interactions with several genes including: ABL1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, ESR1, FLT1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KDR, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, PPARG, PTGS1, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
