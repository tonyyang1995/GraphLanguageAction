Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCNC(=O)c1ccc(-c2nc3ccccc3s2)s1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure including a benzene ring, an amide group (-CONH-), and sulfur-containing groups (-SS-). This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins that have similar chemical functional groups.
Step 2: Among the provided genes, those involved in drug metabolism and receptor functions are more likely to interact with this molecule. Genes such as CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 encode enzymes involved in the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics, which could interact with the amide and aromatic groups present in the molecule.
Step 3: The presence of a benzene ring and amide group might also suggest interaction with genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or ion channels. For example, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which code for serotonin receptors, could potentially bind to this molecule due to their affinity for similar structural motifs.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure may interact with enzymes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism, such as PTGS1 (COX-1), which could be related to the molecule's potential anti-inflammatory effects.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its possible interactions, the related genes include: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, PTGS1.
