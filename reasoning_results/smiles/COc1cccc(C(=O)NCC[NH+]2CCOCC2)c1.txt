Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cccc(C(=O)NCC[NH+]2CCOCC2)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with a quinoline-like structure, which includes a nitrogen atom. This structure is known to interact with several receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH2) suggests potential interactions with enzymes that metabolize drugs, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 3: The molecule also has a pyrrolidine ring and a phenyl ring connected through a carbonyl group, which could potentially bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, involved in serotonin signaling.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a benzene ring with an amide group might interact with ion channels, such as KCNH2, which encodes the HERG potassium channel.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, KCNH2. Step 5: Summary of related gene names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, KCNH2.
