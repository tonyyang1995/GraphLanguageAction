Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NS(=O)(=O)c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents the chemical structure of Nicotine Sulfate (NS(=O)(=O)c1ccccc1), which is a derivative of nicotine. Nicotine sulfate is known for its pharmacological effects, primarily acting as an agonist at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). This means it binds to and activates these receptors.
Step 2: Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are ion channels that open in response to binding of acetylcholine or nicotine. They are involved in various physiological processes and are classified into two types: muscle-type nAChRs and neuronal nAChRs. The neuronal nAChRs are further divided into subtypes based on their subunit composition.
Step 3: Among the provided genes, several are known to encode subunits of neuronal nAChRs:
- CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4 encode muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subunits, not nAChR subunits.
- CNR1 encodes cannabinoid receptor 1, unrelated to nAChRs.
- CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) are involved in drug metabolism but do not directly interact with nicotine sulfate.
- DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4 encode dopamine receptors, which are distinct from nAChRs.
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C encode serotonin receptors, also different from nAChRs.
- HRH1 encodes histamine receptor 1, unrelated to nAChRs.
Step 4: The relevant gene here is CHRM1, which codes for the α4 subunit of the neuronal nAChR. Nicotine sulfate acts as an agonist at this receptor, facilitating the opening of the channel and allowing calcium ions to enter the cell. This interaction is central to the pharmacological actions of nicotine.
Step 5: Therefore, the molecule Nicotine Sulfate is most closely related to the gene CHRM1, encoding the α4 subunit of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.
Summary of related gene names: CHRM1.
