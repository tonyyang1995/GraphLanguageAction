Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [NH3+]CCc1c[n-]cn1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains an amine group (-NH3+) which is basic and can form hydrogen bonds. This feature is relevant for receptors that bind basic ligands such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 2: The aromatic ring system (CC) in the molecule can interact with hydrophobic binding pockets of proteins, particularly those involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 3: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the cyclic part (c[n-]cn1) suggests potential interactions with ion channels, as nitrogen-containing heterocycles are common in channel blockers.
Step 4: The molecule’s overall structure indicates possible interaction with enzymes or transporters due to its lipophilic nature and the presence of functional groups that could act as substrates or inhibitors.
Step 5: Based on the structural features, the molecule may be related to genes encoding GPCRs, ion channels, enzymes, and transporters involved in neurotransmitter metabolism and signaling.
