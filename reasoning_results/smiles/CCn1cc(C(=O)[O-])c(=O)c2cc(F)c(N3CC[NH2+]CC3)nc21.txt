Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCn1cc(C(=O)[O-])c(=O)c2cc(F)c(N3CC[NH2+]CC3)nc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex structure that includes multiple functional groups such as amide, ester, and aromatic rings, along with a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (indicated by 'n' in the SMILES). This complexity suggests it could be a drug-like molecule designed to interact with biological targets.
Step 2: Among the provided genes, several are known to be involved in the metabolism or signaling pathways that might be affected by molecules like this one. For example, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 are cytochrome P450 enzymes responsible for metabolizing many drugs. The presence of an ester group in the molecule suggests it could be metabolized by these enzymes, making them potential targets for the molecule.
Step 3: Additionally, HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A) and HTR2B (serotonin receptor 2B) are G-protein coupled receptors that could interact with a molecule containing an amine or amide group, which is common in many pharmaceutical agents. These receptors are often targeted by drugs affecting mood and behavior.
Step 4: The molecule also has a structure that could potentially interact with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, indicated by the presence of a choline moiety (N3CC[NH2+]CC3), which aligns with the features of CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4, encoding muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.
Step 5: Given the above analysis, the genes related to this molecule include: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4.
