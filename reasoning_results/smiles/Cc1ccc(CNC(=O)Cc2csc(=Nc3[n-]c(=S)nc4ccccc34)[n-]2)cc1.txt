Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a quinolone-like structure, which is a common feature in ligands that interact with various receptors, including some G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural pattern suggests potential interactions with GPCRs.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) and amide (-CONH-) functional groups indicate the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes such as CYP2D6, which is involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The aromatic rings and heterocycles in the molecule might interact with ion channels, particularly those associated with calcium (CACNA1H) and potassium (KCNH2) ions.
Step 4: Given the presence of a pyrrolidine ring and amine groups, the molecule may have affinity for receptors like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are dopamine receptors.
Step 5: The overall structure and functional groups suggest potential interactions with genes involved in neurotransmitter signaling pathways, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which encode serotonin receptors.
