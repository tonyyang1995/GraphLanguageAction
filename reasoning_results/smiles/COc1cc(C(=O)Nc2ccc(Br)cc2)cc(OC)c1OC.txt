Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc(C(=O)Nc2ccc(Br)cc2)cc(OC)c1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound containing several functional groups such as an amide (-CONH-), a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH), a bromine atom, and an ether linkage (-O-). This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in drug metabolism, transport, and receptor binding.
Step 2: The presence of the amide group (-CONH-) indicates that this molecule could be a ligand for various receptors or enzymes. Among the provided genes, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 are known cytochrome P450 enzymes that metabolize many drugs, including those containing amide groups.
Step 3: The phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) can participate in hydrogen bonding and can also act as a nucleophile in reactions. Genes like PTGS1 (COX1/COX2) encode cyclooxygenase enzymes which use similar functional groups in their substrates.
Step 4: The bromine atom (-Br) might influence the molecule’s pharmacokinetic properties, such as its lipophilicity and stability, potentially affecting drug transporters. SLC6A4 encodes a sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter, which could be relevant if the molecule has amino acid-like properties.
Step 5: Given the complexity and specific functional groups of the molecule, it is likely to interact with multiple genes involved in drug metabolism and transport, such as CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, PTGS1, and SLC6A4.
