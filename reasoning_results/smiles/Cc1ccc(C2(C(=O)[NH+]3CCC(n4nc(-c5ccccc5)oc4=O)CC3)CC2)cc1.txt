Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(C2(C(=O)[NH+]3CCC(n4nc(-c5ccccc5)oc4=O)CC3)CC2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with multiple functional groups such as aromatic rings, amide, and ester functionalities. This structure suggests the molecule could interact with proteins involved in various physiological processes, including signal transduction, neurotransmission, and metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-CONH-) and an ester group (-COOR) indicates the molecule could potentially act as an agonist or antagonist for receptors that bind to these functional groups, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are known to be associated with numerous signaling pathways and are linked to several genes listed here, particularly those involved in neurotransmission and hormone receptor functions.
Step 3: Considering the pattern of the molecule, it has a central benzene ring which is often found in ligands that interact with nuclear receptors. Nuclear receptors are transcription factors that regulate gene expression in response to ligands, and they are associated with several genes like CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: The molecule also contains a nitrogen atom that could form hydrogen bonds, which might interact with amino acid residues in protein binding sites, especially in regions rich in polar or charged residues. This feature is relevant to genes encoding for receptors and ion channels, such as DRD2, HTR1A, and KCNH2, which are involved in neurotransmission and ion transport.
Step 5: Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, the molecule could have diverse interactions with different proteins, but based on the described structure, the most likely related genes are those involved in neurotransmission and hormone signaling, such as DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CNR1, and ESR1.
