Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(NC(=O)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)[NH+]2CCOCC2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex molecule with multiple functional groups, including an amide (NC(=O)), a carboxylic acid (CO), a nitro group (N[+]), and various aromatic rings (Cc1...). The presence of an amide and a carboxylic acid suggests that this molecule could be an inhibitor or substrate for enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: Among the given genes, several are known to be involved in drug metabolism and transport processes. For instance, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are cytochrome P450 enzymes that metabolize various drugs, while SLC6A2 and SLC6A4 are sodium-dependent neurotransmitter transporters that play a role in the reuptake of monoamines like serotonin and norepinephrine.
Step 3: Given the presence of amides and carboxylic acids in the molecule, it could potentially interact with enzymes like those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to oxidize these functional groups. This interaction might affect the metabolism of the molecule in the body.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure could influence the function of neurotransmitter transporters such as those encoded by SLC6A2 and SLC6A4. These transporters are involved in the clearance of neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft, and the binding of the molecule could alter their activity, leading to changes in neurotransmitter levels.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule is likely to have a relationship with the following genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4. These genes encode enzymes and transporters that are involved in the metabolism and clearance of drugs and neurotransmitters, respectively.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- SLC6A2
- SLC6A4
