Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(NC1CCCCC1)c1ccc(COCC(F)(F)F)o1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings and functional groups such as an amide (N-C), a carbonyl (C=O), a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH), and a fluoro-substituted benzene ring (F). This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for aromatic compounds, amides, or other functional groups.
Step 2: Analyzing the molecule's functional groups and substituents, it contains a benzene ring with a substituted fluorine group, which could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways or transport mechanisms. Additionally, the presence of an amide group might suggest potential interactions with enzymes or receptors that bind amides.
Step 3: Considering the specific genes listed, those related to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and neurotransmitter systems are particularly relevant due to the presence of aromatic rings and amide groups in the molecule. GPCRs typically bind to small molecules with specific structural motifs, and the amide group could be recognized by certain enzymes or receptors.
Step 4: Among the listed genes, several are known to be involved in neurotransmitter signaling or receptor function, including HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4. These genes encode for serotonin and dopamine receptors, respectively, which are known to bind to small molecules with specific structural features similar to those present in the given molecule.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis of the molecule and the gene features, the following genes are likely to be related to this compound: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4. These genes encode for receptors that may interact with the molecule due to its aromatic and amide-containing structure.
