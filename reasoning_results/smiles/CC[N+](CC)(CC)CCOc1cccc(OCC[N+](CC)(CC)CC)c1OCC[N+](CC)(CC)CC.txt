Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC[N+](CC)(CC)CCOc1cccc(OCC[N+](CC)(CC)CC)c1OCC[N+](CC)(CC)CC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule containing multiple functional groups such as amine (N+), ester (OCC), and aromatic rings (c1cccc). This indicates that the molecule likely interacts with proteins through hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, or binding to specific functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of multiple aromatic rings and amine groups suggests potential interactions with receptors and transporters that have similar chemical features. For example, the amine group could bind to protein receptors, while the aromatic rings might interact with transport proteins.
Step 3: Considering the gene list, several genes encode for receptors and transporters, including DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), HTR1A (Serotonin receptor 1A), CYP2D6 (Cytochrome P450 2D6), and CYP3A4 (Cytochrome P450 3A4). These genes are involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism, which are relevant to the molecule's chemical structure.
Step 4: Given the complexity of the molecule and its potential to interact with various functional groups, it is plausible that the molecule could influence the activity of multiple genes simultaneously. However, based on the chemical structure, the molecule appears more likely to be related to genes involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism.
Step 5: Therefore, the related genes include:
- DRD2
- HTR1A
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
These genes are primarily involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism, aligning with the molecule's structural characteristics.
