Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCN=c1[n-]c(SCCOc2ccc(C)cc2)nc(=NC(C)C)[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring system, specifically an imidazole ring, which is part of the nitro group (-N=) attached to a benzene ring. This structural feature suggests potential interactions with proteins that bind to or are influenced by such groups, particularly those involved in neurotransmission and receptor signaling.
Step 2: The presence of a sulfhydryl group (-SC-) and a carbonyl group (C=O) could indicate potential interactions with enzymes or receptors that have thiol or hydroxyl functional groups, such as cysteine residues in proteins. This might be relevant for genes encoding proteins with these residues.
Step 3: The overall structure includes multiple aromatic rings and polar functional groups, which could interact with DNA binding domains or other protein regions involved in transcriptional regulation. This may suggest potential relationships with genes involved in cellular signaling pathways.
Step 4: The molecule’s complexity and specific functional groups (nitro, sulfhydryl, carbonyl) could influence interactions with proteins that modulate ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors, and G-protein coupled receptors, indicating possible relevance to genes encoding such proteins.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to interact with genes involved in neurotransmission, signal transduction, and possibly transcriptional regulation. The related gene names include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CNR1, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
