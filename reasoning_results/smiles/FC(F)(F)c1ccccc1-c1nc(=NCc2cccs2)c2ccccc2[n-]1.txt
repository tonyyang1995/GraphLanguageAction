Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1-c1nc(=NCc2cccs2)c2ccccc2[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with multiple functional groups, including fluorine atoms (F), aromatic rings, and nitrogen-containing heterocycles. The presence of fluorine atoms suggests that this molecule could be a fluorinated compound, which might have specific interactions with proteins or enzymes involved in drug metabolism or neurotransmission.
Step 2: The aromatic rings and nitrogen-containing heterocycles indicate that this molecule likely has a planar structure and possibly contains amine functionalities. Such structural features are common in ligands for receptors and transporters involved in signal transduction pathways, such as those mediated by G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and monoamine transporters.
Step 3: Given the presence of nitrogen-containing heterocycles and potential amine functionalities, this molecule might interact with receptors or transporters that contain similar functional groups. For example, it could potentially bind to adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) or muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4). These receptors play crucial roles in various physiological processes, including neurotransmission and hormone signaling.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure may also allow for interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize a wide range of drugs. These enzymes are part of the cytochrome P450 family and are responsible for oxidizing substrates, which could lead to the activation or inactivation of the molecule depending on its chemical structure.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule could be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4.
Summary of related gene names:
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- ADRB2
- CHRM1
- CHRM3
- CHRM4
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP3A4
These genes are associated with receptors and enzymes that could potentially interact with the described molecular structure. However, further experimental validation would be necessary to confirm any specific interactions.
