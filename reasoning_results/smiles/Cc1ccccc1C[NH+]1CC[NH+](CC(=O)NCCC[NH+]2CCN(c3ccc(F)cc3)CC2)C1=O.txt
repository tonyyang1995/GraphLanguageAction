Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccccc1C[NH+]1CC[NH+](CC(=O)NCCC[NH+]2CCN(c3ccc(F)cc3)CC2)C1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule contains a benzene ring system with an amide group attached to it. This structure suggests that the molecule could be a derivative of a known ligand or drug that interacts with certain receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (CONH) indicates that this molecule might have the ability to form hydrogen bonds, which is a common interaction pattern for drugs targeting receptors such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: Given the structure and the potential for hydrogen bonding, the molecule could interact with GPCRs, specifically those involved in neurotransmitter signaling pathways. Examples of such receptors include DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), HTR2A (Serotonin receptor 5-HT2A), and HTR2B (Serotonin receptor 5-HT2B). These receptors are known to bind various ligands that modulate their activity.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a carboxamide group (CONH) in the molecule might indicate its potential to inhibit enzymes such as CYP2D6, which is involved in the metabolism of many drugs and endogenous compounds. This could imply that the molecule may affect the pharmacokinetics of other drugs through inhibition of CYP2D6.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and the potential interactions with receptors and enzymes, the related genes would likely include those encoding GPCRs (e.g., DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B) and enzymes involved in drug metabolism (e.g., CYP2D6).
Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- CYP2D6
These genes are directly or indirectly related to the molecule's potential pharmacological activities. Other genes listed do not have a clear direct connection based on the described structure.
