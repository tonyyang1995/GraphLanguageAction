Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1nc(C)c(-c2cc[n-]c(=N)n2)s1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with a nitrogen atom bearing a substituent (sulfonamide) and an aromatic amine group. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a sulfonamide group indicates possible interaction with cytochrome P450 enzymes, specifically CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are known to metabolize sulfonamides.
Step 3: The aromatic amine group could interact with receptors such as HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A), which is associated with CYP2D6, another enzyme involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: The overall structure also hints at potential binding to G-protein coupled receptors, particularly those involved in neurotransmission, like DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2).
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure, the most likely related genes are CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A, and DRD2.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A, DRD2. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with a nitrogen atom bearing a substituent (sulfonamide) and an aromatic amine group. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
