Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+](C)CCC=C1c2ccccc2C=Cc2ccccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex molecule that contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (N+), which is part of a larger aromatic ring system. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for positively charged amino acids or aromatic rings.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and multiple double bonds indicates a high degree of conjugation, which can contribute to the molecule's overall stability and polarity. This structural feature could influence its interaction with proteins that are involved in signal transduction pathways, such as receptors and enzymes.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a quinoline-like structure, which is known to interact with certain protein targets. Quinoline derivatives can act as ligands for various receptors and ion channels, particularly those involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction.
Step 4: Considering the molecular features identified, the molecule may be related to several genes involved in neurotransmission, receptor function, and signal transduction. These include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KDR, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, and DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
Step 5: Summary of related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KDR, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4. 
These genes are associated with adrenergic receptors, muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, serotonin receptors, and other signaling molecules that might interact with the described molecular structure. However, further functional studies would be needed to confirm specific interactions and mechanisms.
