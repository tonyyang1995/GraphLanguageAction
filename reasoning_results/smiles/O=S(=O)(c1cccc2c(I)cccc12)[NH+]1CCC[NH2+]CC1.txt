Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=S(=O)(c1cccc2c(I)cccc12)[NH+]1CCC[NH2+]CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains an oxazolone ring system (O=S(=O)) and amide groups ([NH+]1CCC[NH2+]CC1). These structural features suggest potential interactions with enzymes that metabolize or recognize similar functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of a quinoline-like structure (c1cccc2c(I)cccc12) indicates possible binding to receptors or transporters that interact with aromatic compounds.
Step 3: The amine groups in the molecule could be recognized by various G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as adrenergic and muscarinic receptors, which are associated with several listed genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 4: The presence of a benzene ring and a nitrogen atom with positive charge might also interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs), particularly CYP2D6, involved in drug metabolism.
Step 5: Given the complex structure and potential for interaction with multiple types of receptors and metabolic pathways, the molecule may have relationships with a few key genes including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2D6.
Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2D6.
