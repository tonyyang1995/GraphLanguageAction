Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(CC(=O)Nc2cc(Cl)c(-c3ccccc3OC(F)(F)F)c(Cl)c2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring with multiple substituents including an amide group, a ketone group, and a chlorine atom. The presence of a ketone group (CC(=O)) and an amide group (Nc2cc(Cl)c(-c3ccccc3OC(F)(F)F)c(Cl)c2) suggests that this molecule could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, particularly those with binding sites for ligands with similar functional groups.
Step 2: The molecule also contains a phenylalanine moiety (C(=O)Nc2cc(Cl)c(-c3ccccc3OC(F)(F)F)c(Cl)c2), which could potentially interact with proteins that have specific binding pockets for aromatic compounds or amino acid derivatives. This could be relevant for genes involved in neurotransmitter transport or receptor function.
Step 3: The presence of a fluorinated phenyl group (-OC(F)(F)F) might indicate that the molecule has specific interactions with proteins that recognize or bind to fluorinated compounds, possibly influencing the activity of enzymes or receptors that metabolize or interact with such compounds.
Step 4: Considering the structure and potential interactions, the molecule may have relevance to genes involved in neurotransmitter systems and receptor signaling, such as HTR2A (serotonin 5-HT2A receptor), HTR2B (serotonin 5-HT2B receptor), and HTR2C (serotonin 5-HT2C receptor). These genes encode receptors that are known to interact with various ligands, including those with aromatic and amide functionalities.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and potential interactions, the related genes are likely to include those involved in neurotransmitter systems and receptor signaling, such as:
- HTR1A (serotonin 5-HT1A receptor)
- HTR2A (serotonin 5-HT2A receptor)
- HTR2B (serotonin 5-HT2B receptor)
- HTR2C (serotonin 5-HT2C receptor)
- HTR6 (serotonin 5-HT6 receptor)
- CHRM1 (choline acetyltransferase)
- CHRM3 (muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3)
- CHRM4 (muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M4)
- DRD2 (dopamine D2 receptor)
- DRD3 (dopamine D3 receptor)
- DRD4 (dopamine D4 receptor) To summarize, the related gene names are HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4. These genes are involved in neurotransmitter systems and receptor signaling, which aligns with the structural features of the given molecule.
