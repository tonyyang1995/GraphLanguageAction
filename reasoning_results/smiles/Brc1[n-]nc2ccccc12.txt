Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Brc1[n-]nc2ccccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string Brc1[n-]nc2ccccc12 has a tricyclic aromatic structure with a nitrogen atom bearing a negative charge (-). This pattern suggests the molecule could be a derivative of a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), which are known to interact with various neurotransmitter receptors and enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom with a negative charge indicates the molecule may have an amine group that can participate in hydrogen bonding and other interactions with receptor sites, particularly those that bind to ligands with similar functional groups.
Step 3: Given the tricyclic structure and the negative charge on the nitrogen, this molecule likely interacts with receptors such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are serotonin receptors. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter involved in mood regulation, and TCAs are known to affect its levels and binding to these receptors.
Step 4: Additionally, the negative charge and aromatic rings suggest potential interactions with CYP enzymes, specifically CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are responsible for metabolizing many drugs including TCAs.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related genes are primarily those involved in serotonin signaling and drug metabolism, including HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.
Summary of related gene names:
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4 Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string Brc1[n-]nc2ccccc12 has a tricyclic aromatic structure with a nitrogen atom bearing a negative charge (-). This pattern suggests the molecule could be a derivative of a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA).
- CYP3A4
Note: The initial structure analysis was focused on the tricyclic aromatic pattern and the negative charge, which led to the identification of relevant genes involved in serotonin signaling and drug metabolism. The remaining steps were simplified to maintain the focus on the primary relationships. The final summary lists the
