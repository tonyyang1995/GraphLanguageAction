Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(=[NH2+])NCc1cccc(C[NH3+])c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring, which is a five-membered nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring. This structural feature is common in several neurotransmitter receptors and transporters.
Step 2: The presence of a positively charged amine group (N+) on the molecule suggests it could interact with ion channels or receptors that have binding sites for positively charged molecules, such as ligand-gated ion channels or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The molecule also has a phenyl group attached to the nitrogen atom, which is a common feature in many receptor ligands and can participate in hydrophobic interactions with the cell membrane.
Step 4: Given the above structural features, the molecule could potentially interact with genes encoding neurotransmitter receptors, such as HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, and HRH1, which are involved in regulating various neurotransmitter signaling pathways.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule might interact with genes encoding ion channels like KCNH2, which could be influenced by its ability to form ion-conducting channels or modulate their activity through direct binding.
Summary of related gene names: HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HRH1, KCNH2. 
Note: The SMILES string provided does not directly correspond to a known drug or compound with a clear therapeutic target, but based on the structural analysis, the molecule could potentially interact with these genes due to its chemical features. The exact interaction would depend on further experimental validation. Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring, a common feature in many neurotransmitter receptors and transporters.
Step 2: It has a positively charged amine group (N+), which can interact with ion channels or GPCRs.
Step 3: The phenyl group attached to the nitrogen atom can participate in hydrophobic interactions with cell membranes.
Step 4: These structural features suggest potential interactions with genes encoding neurotransmitter receptors like HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, and HRH1.
Step 5: The molecule might also interact with genes encoding ion channels like KCNH2.
Note: The exact interactions would need experimental confirmation.
