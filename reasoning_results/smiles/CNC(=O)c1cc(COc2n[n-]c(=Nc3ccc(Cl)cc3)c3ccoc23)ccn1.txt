Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CNC(=O)c1cc(COc2n[n-]c(=Nc3ccc(Cl)cc3)c3ccoc23)ccn1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with a carboxamide group (C(=O)NH) attached to it, which suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a pyrrolidine ring, which could indicate potential binding to receptors like DRD2, HTR1A, and HTR2A, given their common ligand-binding sites.
Step 3: The presence of a nitrile group (-CN) might suggest interactions with enzymes like CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize compounds containing this functional group.
Step 4: The molecule has a heterocyclic ring system, particularly a pyridine ring, which could potentially interact with ion channels such as KCNH2 or receptors like HRH1.
Step 5: Given the complex structure with multiple functional groups and rings, the molecule may have interactions with several genes involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways, including but not limited to DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, and CYP2D6.
