Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a negative charge (-) and multiple aromatic rings, which suggests it may interact with ion channels or receptors that have similar structural features.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH-) and an amide group (-CON-) indicates potential interactions with enzymes such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are involved in the metabolism of various drugs.
Step 3: The molecule has a benzene ring with substituents that could potentially interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are involved in neurotransmission.
Step 4: The presence of a pyrrolidine ring and a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) might indicate interactions with enzymes like CYP1A2, which metabolizes certain substrates including caffeine and nicotine.
Step 5: The molecule's complex structure, including the presence of multiple functional groups and aromatic rings, suggests potential interactions with various receptors and enzymes, possibly including CYP3A4, which is involved in the metabolism of numerous drugs.
