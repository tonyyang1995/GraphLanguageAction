Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cccc(CC(=O)[NH+]2Cc3ccc(S(=O)(=O)N=c4cnn(C5CCC5)[n-]4)cc3C2)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule is a complex organic compound, which appears to be a derivative of a benzene ring with various functional groups attached, including a carboxamide group (-CONH), an acetyl group (C(=O)C), and a sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)N). This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for similar chemical motifs.
Step 2: Given the presence of the carboxamide and acetyl groups, this molecule could potentially interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize drugs containing amide and ester groups. These enzymes are part of the cytochrome P450 family and play crucial roles in the biotransformation of xenobiotics.
Step 3: The sulfonamide group present in the molecule might also suggest a potential interaction with receptors or transporters that recognize such functional groups. For example, CYP2C19, which is involved in the metabolism of various drugs including sulfonamides, could be relevant here.
Step 4: Additionally, the overall structure of the molecule might allow it to interact with ion channels or other membrane-bound proteins due to its size and hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance. For instance, KCNH2, which encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel, might be a potential target given the complex nature of the molecule.
Step 5: Based on the structural features identified, the related genes would likely include those involved in drug metabolism (CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP2C19), receptors and transporters (possibly CYP2C9), and ion channels (KCNH2).
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- KCNH2
These genes are the most likely candidates for interacting with the described molecular structure. Other genes listed may not have a direct relationship based on the current information. However, further detailed analysis would be required to confirm these interactions experimentally.
