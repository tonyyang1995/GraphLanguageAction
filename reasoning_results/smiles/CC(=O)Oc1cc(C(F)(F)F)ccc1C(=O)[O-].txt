Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(=O)Oc1cc(C(F)(F)F)ccc1C(=O)[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a structure that includes a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), an ester group (C(=O)O), and a trifluoromethyl group (F). This structure suggests the molecule could be an inhibitor of enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: Looking at the genes provided, several are known to be involved in drug metabolism pathways. CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 are all cytochrome P450 enzymes that play significant roles in metabolizing various drugs. CYP enzymes are particularly relevant because they catalyze the oxidation of substrates, which often involves the formation or breakdown of esters and carboxylic acids.
Step 3: The trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) in the molecule might interact with certain receptors or enzymes through hydrogen bonding or other intermolecular forces. This feature could be relevant for genes such as HRH1 (histamine H1 receptor) or DRD2 (dopamine D2 receptor), both of which have been shown to interact with molecules containing fluorine atoms.
Step 4: The presence of the carboxylic acid group and the ester linkage suggests potential interactions with ion channels or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). For instance, KCNH2 encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel, and HTR2A (serotonin 5-HT2A receptor) is a GPCR that binds serotonin and may interact with compounds containing acidic or ester functionalities.
Step 5: Based on the structural features of the molecule, the most likely related genes are those involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and those encoding receptors that might interact with acidic or ester-containing ligands (HRH1, DRD2, HTR2A).
Summary of Related Genes:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- HRH1
- DRD2
- HTR2A
These genes are directly or indirectly related to the molecule's potential interactions based on their functions and known ligand binding preferences. Other genes listed do not have a direct structural or functional link to the molecule described.
