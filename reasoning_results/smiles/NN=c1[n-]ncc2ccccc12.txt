Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NN=c1[n-]ncc2ccccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The SMILES string NN=c1[n-]ncc2ccccc12 represents a molecule that includes a nitrogen atom double-bonded to a carbon atom (N=c1), a negatively charged nitrogen atom (n-), and a benzene ring (c2). This structure suggests the presence of an amine group (-NH2) and a negatively charged nitrogen, which could be involved in binding to proteins or receptors.
Step 2: The negatively charged nitrogen (-n-) and the aromatic nature of the benzene ring are key features that could interact with ion channels, transporters, and receptors. Ion channels often have charged residues for selective permeability, and transporters can bind charged molecules. The benzene ring might interact with aromatic residues in protein binding sites.
Step 3: Considering the ion channel and receptor interactions, the molecule could potentially affect G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ligand-gated ion channels. GPCRs are known to be modulated by various small molecules, including those with aromatic rings and charged functional groups. Ligand-gated ion channels are also sensitive to small molecules due to their open/closed state being regulated by ligands.
Step 4: Given the potential interactions with GPCRs and ion channels, several genes related to these pathways are likely to be affected. These include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode for various subtypes of adrenergic and muscarinic receptors and serotonin receptors.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule may also interact with CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) involved in drug metabolism, as the benzene ring and amine group could serve as substrates or inhibitors for these enzymes. This interaction could influence pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.
Summary of related genes:
- ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2
- CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4
These genes are involved in the function of neurotransmitter receptors and drug metabolism pathways, making them potential targets for the described molecule.
