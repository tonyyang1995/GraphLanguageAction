Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)Sc1oc(-c2ccco2)nc1S(=O)(=O)c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a complex structure including a benzene ring (indicated by 'C'), a sulfur atom (S), and multiple nitrogen atoms (N). This pattern suggests potential interactions with proteins that have similar chemical groups, such as those involved in signal transduction or neurotransmission.
Step 2: The presence of a sulfonamide group (-S(=O)(=O)-) indicates a possible interaction with enzymes or receptors that have sulfhydryl groups, which could be relevant to genes involved in metabolism or receptor signaling pathways.
Step 3: The aromatic rings and hydrophobic substituents suggest the molecule may interact with membrane proteins, particularly G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are involved in various signaling pathways. This could relate to genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 4: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) might indicate the molecule has some acidic properties, which could influence its interaction with ion channels or other acidic sites on proteins. This could be relevant to genes like KCNH2.
Step 5: The overall structure and functional groups of the molecule suggest it could potentially modulate the activity of enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.
