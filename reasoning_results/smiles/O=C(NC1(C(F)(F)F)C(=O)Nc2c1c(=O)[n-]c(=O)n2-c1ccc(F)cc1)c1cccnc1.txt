Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(NC1(C(F)(F)F)C(=O)Nc2c1c(=O)[n-]c(=O)n2-c1ccc(F)cc1)c1cccnc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this is relevant or important.
Step 1: The molecule contains multiple aromatic rings and functional groups such as nitriles, amides, and fluorine atoms. These features suggest potential interactions with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways and receptor binding.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrile group (-CN) and amide bonds (-CONH-) indicates the molecule could act as a ligand or inhibitor for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are often associated with neurotransmitter and hormone signaling.
Step 3: The fluorine atoms (-F) in the molecule may contribute to its pharmacokinetic properties, affecting its absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. Fluorinated molecules are commonly found in drugs targeting ion channels and receptors.
Step 4: Given the pattern of aromatic rings and functional groups, the molecule might interact with proteins involved in calcium signaling, such as voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), which are encoded by genes like CACNA1H.
Step 5: Considering the potential interactions with GPCRs and VGCCs, the molecule may be related to genes encoding these receptors and channels, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, and KCNH2.
