Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC[NH+](CC)CCNc1ccc(CO)c2sc3ccccc3c(=O)c12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (NH+), indicating it is an amine salt or a positively charged amine. This structural feature suggests potential interactions with ion channels or receptors that have specific binding sites for charged molecules.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring (CC) attached to the nitrogen atom (NH+) suggests a possible interaction with enzymes or receptors that are involved in the metabolism or signaling pathways associated with aromatic compounds. This could include genes involved in drug metabolism or neurotransmitter receptor functions.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a carboxylic acid group (CO) and a cyclic amide (c1ccc(CO)c2sc3ccccc3c(=O)c12), which may indicate potential interactions with proteins or enzymes that have acidic or basic functional groups, such as ion channels or transporters.
Step 4: Considering the molecular structure, there are no direct matches to the specific features of the listed genes; however, the overall pattern of the molecule might suggest interactions with genes involved in neurotransmission, drug metabolism, and signal transduction, such as those related to ion channels, receptors, and metabolic enzymes.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule could be related to genes involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism. Therefore, the related gene names include:
- ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2 (adrenergic receptors)
- CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 (cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in drug metabolism)
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6 (serotonin receptors)
- DRD2, DRD3, DRD4 (dopamine receptors)
- PTGS1 (prostaglandin synthase 1) Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (NH+), indicating it is an amine salt or a positively charged amine. This structural feature suggests potential interactions with ion channels or receptors that have specific binding sites for charged molecules.
