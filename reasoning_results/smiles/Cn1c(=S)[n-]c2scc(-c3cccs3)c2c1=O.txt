Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cn1c(=S)[n-]c2scc(-c3cccs3)c2c1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a thioether group (-S-) and an arylamine group (-NH2), which are often found in ligands that interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This suggests potential interaction with GPCRs.
Step 2: The molecule also has a quinone-like structure, which is characteristic of certain inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as CYP2D6 and CYP2C9. This indicates possible inhibition of these enzymes.
Step 3: The presence of a nitrile group (-CN) and a carbonyl group (-CO) suggests the molecule could be an activator or inhibitor of enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways, such as kinases.
Step 4: The overall structure does not directly suggest strong binding to nuclear receptors like those encoded by NR1I3 (NOR1), PPARG, or HTR2C, but it may influence their activity indirectly through modulation of signaling pathways.
Step 5: Based on the structural features identified, the molecule is most likely to be related to CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and kinases (e.g., CDK2, LCK).
