Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCC1Sc2ccccc2N(CC(=O)NCCC2=CCCCC2)C1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule likely to be an inhibitor of CYP enzymes, specifically CYP2D6 and CYP2C19. This is inferred from the presence of a quinolone-like structure (quinoline ring system) and a carboxamide group, which are typical functional groups found in CYP inhibitors.
Step 2: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group attached, which is characteristic of substrates for CYP2C19 enzymes. Additionally, the presence of a quinolone-like structure, which is known to interact with CYP2D6, further supports this inference.
Step 3: The gene CYP2D6 codes for an enzyme that metabolizes various drugs, including antidepressants and antipsychotics, which might be influenced by this molecule due to its structural similarity to known CYP2D6 inhibitors.
Step 4: Similarly, CYP2C19 is another enzyme involved in drug metabolism, particularly for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), statins, and certain anticoagulants. The presence of a carboxamide group and the overall structure suggest potential interaction with CYP2C19.
Step 5: Therefore, the molecule is most likely related to CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 among the given genes.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2D6, CYP2C19.
