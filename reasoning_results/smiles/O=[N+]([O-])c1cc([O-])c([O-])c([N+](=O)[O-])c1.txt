Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=[N+]([O-])c1cc([O-])c([O-])c([N+](=O)[O-])c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure containing multiple functional groups such as an amide (N=O), an amine (N+), and several oxygen-containing heterocycles including a pyrrole ring. This structure suggests that it may be involved in interactions with proteins that have similar chemical functionalities.
Step 2: Considering the presence of amide and amine groups, the molecule likely interacts with enzymes or receptors that recognize and bind to these functional groups. Examples include CYP (Cytochrome P450) enzymes, which are known to metabolize drugs through amide and amine functional groups.
Step 3: The molecule also contains negatively charged oxygen atoms (-O-), which could interact with positively charged residues on protein surfaces. This interaction pattern is characteristic of molecules that might bind to ion channels or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Specific examples from the provided list include CACNA1H (a calcium channel), CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4 (cholinergic receptors), HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6 (serotonin receptors), and DRD2, DRD3, DRD4 (dopamine receptors).
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a pyrrole ring and other heterocyclic structures can suggest interactions with nuclear receptors or other transcription factors. For instance, CYP enzymes and other metabolic pathways involving these functional groups can modulate gene expression through nuclear receptor binding sites.
Step 5: Based on the detailed analysis of the molecule's structure and potential interactions, the related genes are: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CACNA1H, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
