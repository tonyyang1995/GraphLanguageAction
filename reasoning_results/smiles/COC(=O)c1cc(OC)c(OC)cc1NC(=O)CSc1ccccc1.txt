Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COC(=O)c1cc(OC)c(OC)cc1NC(=O)CSc1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule, represented by the SMILES string COC(=O)c1cc(OC)c(OC)cc1NC(=O)CSc1ccccc1, contains several functional groups such as an amide (N-C=O), a benzene ring (c1ccccc1), and ether (OC) and ester (C(=O)O) functionalities. These features suggest that the molecule could be involved in interactions with proteins that have binding sites for these functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group suggests potential interactions with receptors or enzymes that recognize and bind amides. This includes G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYPs), which are known to metabolize amides. Among the listed genes, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 are all members of the cytochrome P450 family and may interact with this molecule through amide metabolism.
Step 3: The benzene ring in the molecule might also allow it to interact with aromatic binding pockets of proteins. This is particularly relevant for proteins containing tyrosine kinase domains, such as LCK, which is included in the list of genes. Benzene rings can form π-π stacking interactions, which are important for protein-ligand binding.
Step 4: The molecule’s structure also includes chiral centers, which could influence its interaction with proteins that have stereoselective binding sites. For instance, D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) and other enzymes with chiral specificity could potentially interact with this molecule. However, none of the listed genes specifically mention D-amino acid metabolism, so we will focus on the more common interactions mentioned above.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to interact with the following genes due to their involvement in amide metabolism (CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and potential aromatic interactions (LCK). Other genes like CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and DRD2, which are involved in neurotransmission, could also interact but would require further experimental evidence to confirm.
