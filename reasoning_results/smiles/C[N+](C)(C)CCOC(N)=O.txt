Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[N+](C)(C)CCOC(N)=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional analysis or conclusions.
Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing nitrogen, oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen atoms. It has a positively charged nitrogen atom in the amine group, which is part of an amino group bonded to a benzene ring. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for similar chemical moieties, such as ligands or neurotransmitters.
Step 2: The presence of an ester functional group (-COOR) and an amide group (-CONR2) indicates that the molecule could interact with enzymes or receptors that process these functional groups, such as those involved in drug metabolism or signaling pathways. 
Step 3: The aromatic nature of the benzene ring and the presence of multiple carbon-hydrogen bonds suggest the molecule may be able to form hydrogen bonds and other non-covalent interactions with proteins, particularly those with hydrophobic binding pockets.
Step 4: Given the chemical structure, this molecule might interact with receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmitter signaling, drug metabolism, and inflammatory processes, which are associated with several genes listed.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure, it is likely to be related to genes involved in neurotransmitter signaling (e.g., HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), drug metabolism (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), and inflammatory responses (e.g., PTGS1).
Summary of related gene names: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, PTGS1.
