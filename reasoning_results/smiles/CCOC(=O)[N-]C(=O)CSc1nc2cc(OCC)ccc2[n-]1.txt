Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)[N-]C(=O)CSc1nc2cc(OCC)ccc2[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound that includes an amide group (C(=O)N), an alcohol group (OCC), and several aromatic rings. This structure suggests the molecule could be a ligand for receptors or enzymes that interact with such functional groups.
Step 2: Looking at the gene list, several genes are related to neurotransmitter receptors and enzymes involved in drug metabolism. For example, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are all involved in Phase I drug metabolism via cytochrome P450 enzymes, which could interact with the amide and aromatic structures present in the molecule.
Step 3: The presence of an alcohol group (OCC) might suggest interaction with cholinergic receptors, as these often have binding sites for small molecules containing hydroxyl groups. Genes like CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4 are associated with muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, which could potentially bind to this alcohol group.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule’s overall structure could interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), given its aromatic rings and amide functionality. Genes such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which code for serotonin receptors, could be relevant due to their known binding affinity for similar functional groups.
Step 5: Considering the above points, the related genes to this molecule are likely to be those involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6) and neurotransmitter receptor signaling (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C).
