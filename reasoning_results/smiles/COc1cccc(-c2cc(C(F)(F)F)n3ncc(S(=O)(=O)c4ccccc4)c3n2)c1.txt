Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cccc(-c2cc(C(F)(F)F)n3ncc(S(=O)(=O)c4ccccc4)c3n2)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound with multiple rings and functional groups, including a benzene ring, a pyrrole ring, and a sulfoxide group. It also contains fluorine atoms, which are known for their ability to modulate protein-protein interactions and enzyme activities.
Step 2: Given the presence of multiple functional groups such as the benzene ring and the sulfoxide group, this molecule could potentially interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, particularly those that are activated by ligands or small molecules. This includes G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are known to be modulated by drugs with similar structures.
Step 3: Considering the pattern of the molecule, it may have the potential to interact with receptors that contain a benzene ring or other aromatic structures, such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4). These receptors are known to bind to ligands with aromatic moieties and can be influenced by the presence of fluorine atoms, which are often used in drug design to improve binding affinity.
Step 4: The sulfoxide group in the molecule might also be relevant for interactions with enzymes that contain cysteine residues, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of various drugs and xenobiotics. The sulfoxide group could act as a nucleophile or electrophile in enzymatic reactions, affecting the activity of these enzymes.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and potential interactions described above, the molecule may be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6.
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6.
