Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a tricyclic structure with a nitrogen atom and multiple functional groups such as amide, carbonyl, and hydroxyl. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in signal transduction and receptor binding.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of an amide group and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle could indicate a possible interaction with receptors that contain similar functional groups, such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule’s tricyclic structure might be relevant to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are known to have specific binding sites for ligands. The molecule could interact with receptors like D2-like dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) and serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), given their diverse binding pockets.
Step 4: Furthermore, the molecule’s potential to modulate signaling pathways may be related to genes involved in signal transduction, such as KCNH2 (a voltage-gated potassium channel subunit), which could be influenced by the molecule’s ability to affect ion channels.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the molecule could be related to ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and KCNH2. These genes are primarily involved in neurotransmitter signaling and ion channel function.
