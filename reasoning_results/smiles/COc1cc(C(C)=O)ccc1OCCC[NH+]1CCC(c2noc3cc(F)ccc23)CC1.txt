Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc(C(C)=O)ccc1OCCC[NH+]1CCC(c2noc3cc(F)ccc23)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a cyano group (-CN), an aromatic amine, and a quinolone-like structure. These features suggest potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a quinolone-like structure, which includes a nitrogen atom and a carboxamide group, indicates that this molecule could interact with enzymes such as CYP2D6, which metabolizes many drugs containing similar structures.
Step 3: The molecule also has a pyrrole ring system, which is characteristic of molecules that can bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This feature suggests potential interactions with genes encoding GPCRs like DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, and HTR2C, which are involved in neurotransmission.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure includes a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group, which might interact with enzymes such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are involved in the metabolism of various drugs.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule may be related to several genes, including CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, and HTR2C.
