Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(CCC[NH+]1CC=C(n2c(=O)[n-]c3ccccc32)CC1)c1ccc(F)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring, which is characteristic of molecules that can interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This suggests potential interaction with genes encoding for GPCRs.
Step 2: The presence of an imidazole group (-N=N-) and a phenyl ring indicates the molecule could be an agonist or antagonist for certain GPCRs, particularly those involved in neurotransmission.
Step 3: The molecule's structure includes a quinoline moiety, which is known to interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as CYP2D6 and CYP2C9, suggesting possible pharmacokinetic interactions with these genes.
Step 4: The presence of a benzene ring with a nitro substituent might indicate potential interactions with enzymes like CYP1A2 and CYP2C19, which metabolize aromatic compounds.
Step 5: The overall structure of the molecule, including its functional groups, may interact with various GPCRs and ion channels, such as HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, and SIGMAR1.
