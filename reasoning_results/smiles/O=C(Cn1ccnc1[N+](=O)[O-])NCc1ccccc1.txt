Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Cn1ccnc1[N+](=O)[O-])NCc1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other type of content.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring system, which is characteristic of several psychoactive compounds that interact with neurotransmitter receptors.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-CONH-) suggests potential interaction with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2D6 and CYP2C19.
Step 3: The nitrogen atom in the amide group could be positively charged, indicating possible interaction with negatively charged sites on G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like DRD2, HTR1A, and HTR2A.
Step 4: The overall structure includes a benzene ring, which might interact with proteins such as PTGS1, known for its role in prostaglandin synthesis and inflammation.
Step 5: Given the interactions described, the related genes are: CYP2D6, CYP2C19, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, PTGS1.
Summary of related genes: CYP2D6, CYP2C19, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, PTGS1.
