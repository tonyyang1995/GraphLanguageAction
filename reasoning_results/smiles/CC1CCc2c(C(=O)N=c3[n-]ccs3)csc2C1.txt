Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC1CCc2c(C(=O)N=c3[n-]ccs3)csc2C1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure that includes multiple rings, an amide group (-CONH), and a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH). This structure suggests the molecule could be a drug-like compound, potentially targeting receptors or enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH) in the molecule indicates it may interact with ion channels or transporters, as sulfonamides are known to inhibit certain ion channels and transport proteins. This structural feature is particularly relevant for genes encoding ion channels or transporters.
Step 3: The amide group (-CONH) present in the molecule might indicate the potential for the molecule to act as an agonist or antagonist for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which often have amide groups in their ligands. This structural feature is relevant for genes encoding GPCRs.
Step 4: Given the complexity and the specific functional groups in the molecule, it is plausible that this molecule could interact with enzymes such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, which are known to metabolize drugs. This is indicated by the presence of functional groups like the amide and possibly other hydroxyl groups.
Step 5: Considering the interaction potential with ion channels, transporters, GPCRs, and CYP enzymes, the related genes include those encoding ion channels (CACNA1H, KCNH2), transporters (ABCB1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4), GPCRs (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), and CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Summary of related gene names:
- Ion channels: CACNA1H, KCNH2
- Transporters: ABCB1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4
- GPCRs: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4
- CYP enzymes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4
Note: Other genes listed in the prompt may not be directly related to the molecule based on its structural features, but further investigation would be needed to confirm their relevance. The provided gene list focuses on those that are most likely to interact with the molecule's identified functional groups.
