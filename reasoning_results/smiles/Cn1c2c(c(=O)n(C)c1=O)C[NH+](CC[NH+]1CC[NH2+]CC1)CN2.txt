Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cn1c2c(c(=O)n(C)c1=O)C[NH+](CC[NH+]1CC[NH2+]CC1)CN2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex structure that includes a benzene ring, a quinoline ring, and a number of nitrogen-containing groups, including amine and imidazole functionalities. These functional groups are often involved in binding to receptors and enzymes, which could suggest potential interactions with genes encoding for proteins that have binding sites for these types of molecules.
Step 2: The presence of an imidazole group (-N=N-) in the molecule suggests it might interact with proteins containing imidazole binding sites, such as ion channels, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), or certain enzymes. Among the listed genes, CHRM1 (Cholinergic receptor, muscarinic 1), HTR1A (Serotonin receptor 1A), HTR2A (Serotonin receptor 2A), HTR2B (Serotonin receptor 2B), HTR2C (Serotonin receptor 2C), and HTR6 (Serotonin receptor 6) all encode for GPCRs, which could potentially interact with this imidazole group.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a quinoline ring, which is known to be involved in interactions with various enzymes, particularly those involved in drug metabolism like cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP). The genes CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 all encode for cytochrome P450 enzymes, which could interact with the quinoline ring due to their ability to metabolize similar compounds.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule has a carboxamide group (-CONH2), which can form hydrogen bonds and can be recognized by proteins such as kinases or ion channels. The gene CDK2 encodes for cyclin-dependent kinase 2, which could interact with this functional group through phosphorylation or other mechanisms.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule may be related to the following genes: CHRM1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CDK2.
Summary of related genes: CHRM1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CDK2.
