Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+](C)CCCC1(c2ccc(F)cc2)OCc2cc(C#N)ccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains several functional groups such as amine (NH+), phenyl ring (C6H5), and a cyano group (C#N). These functional groups are often involved in binding to proteins, particularly those with transmembrane domains or receptors.
Step 2: Among the listed genes, several are associated with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) which are membrane-bound proteins that can bind small molecules and activate intracellular signaling cascades. The molecule’s presence of a phenyl ring and a cyano group suggests it could potentially interact with these types of receptors.
Step 3: The specific GPCRs mentioned include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These receptors are known to have binding sites for various ligands, including small organic molecules like the one described.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule’s structure may also interact with enzymes and transporters. Genes such as CYP2D6, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4 are involved in drug metabolism and transport, respectively, which could be influenced by this molecule’s presence.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2D6, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4.
