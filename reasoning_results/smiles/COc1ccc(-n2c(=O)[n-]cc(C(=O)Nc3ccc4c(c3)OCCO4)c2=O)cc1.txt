Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(-n2c(=O)[n-]cc(C(=O)Nc3ccc4c(c3)OCCO4)c2=O)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound with multiple functional groups including an amide, an ester, and a nitro group. These functional groups are indicative of potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for such moieties.
Step 2: Analyzing the structure further, we observe that the molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is a common feature in many ligands that interact with receptors and enzymes. This suggests possible interactions with proteins that have binding pockets accommodating aromatic rings.
Step 3: Given the presence of a nitro group (-NO2) and an amide group (-CONH2), the molecule could potentially act as a substrate for enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those catalyzed by cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs). CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are known to metabolize compounds containing these functional groups.
Step 4: The ester group (-COO-) might also be recognized by certain enzymes involved in lipid metabolism or signaling pathways, such as diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL), which is not listed among the provided genes but is relevant for understanding the metabolic context.
Step 5: Considering the potential for interaction with enzymes and receptors, the most directly related genes from the provided list would be those involved in metabolism and neurotransmission. Specifically, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are likely candidates due to their roles in drug metabolism, and HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which encode serotonin receptors, might be indirectly related if the molecule acts as a serotonin agonist or antagonist.
Summary of Related Genes:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
These genes are related to the molecule due to their involvement in metabolic processes and neurotransmitter signaling, which could be influenced by the presence of specific functional groups in the molecule.
