Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(CSc1nnnn1-c1ccccc1)NCc1cccs1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound that includes a benzene ring, a pyridine ring, and several nitrogen and oxygen heterocycles. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in neurotransmission and receptor binding.
Step 2: The presence of multiple nitrogen-containing heterocycles (such as pyridine and pyrrole) indicates the molecule may have affinity for receptors containing amino groups, such as adrenergic and cholinergic receptors. These receptors are typically involved in signaling pathways modulated by neurotransmitters like norepinephrine and acetylcholine.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a pyrimidine ring, which is often found in ligands for nuclear receptors and enzymes involved in metabolism. This structural feature might indicate the molecule could interact with enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, the molecule could potentially interact with multiple targets, including G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels. Specific examples include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, and HTR2A, which are known to be involved in various physiological processes and diseases.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, HTR2A, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and HTR2B. These genes encode proteins that are likely to interact directly or indirectly with the described molecule.
