Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Nc1ccc([O-])c(C(=O)[O-])c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule, represented by the SMILES string Nc1ccc([O-])c(C(=O)[O-])c1, has a structure that includes a nitrogen atom (N) surrounded by a benzene ring, a negatively charged oxygen group (-O-), and a carboxylate group (-COO-). This structure suggests that the molecule is an organic compound with a heterocyclic backbone and functional groups typical of drugs.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylate group (-COO-) indicates that this molecule could be an acid or a salt. Such functional groups are often found in molecules that interact with proteins involved in signaling pathways or receptors, which are encoded by the genes listed.
Step 3: Given the structure, the molecule likely interacts with membrane-bound or intracellular receptors, as it contains a benzene ring and a charged group. Membrane-bound receptors are encoded by genes such as DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and HRH1, all of which are neurotransmitter or hormone receptors.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's carboxylate group may suggest it could be a substrate for enzymes like CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4, which are involved in drug metabolism. These enzymes are encoded by the CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 genes.
Step 5: The molecule does not appear to have direct structural features that would strongly suggest interaction with other listed genes such as ABCB1 (pump activity), ABL1 (tyrosine kinase), or PTGS1 (cyclooxygenase).
