Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1nn(C)cc1C(=O)N=c1ccn(Cc2c(F)cccc2Cl)[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple functional groups such as amide, aromatic ring, and heterocyclic structures. These structural elements suggest potential interactions with receptors and enzymes that are involved in neurotransmission, signal transduction, and metabolism.
Step 2: Analyzing the functional groups, the amide group (-CO-NH-) indicates possible binding to receptors that have amine functionalities, such as adrenergic (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and dopaminergic (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) receptors. The aromatic ring and heterocyclic structure could interact with various G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), and others.
Step 3: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) suggests potential interactions with enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize drugs containing this functional group. Additionally, the presence of a nitrophenyl group could indicate binding affinity for proteins involved in signaling pathways, such as HRH1 and KDR.
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule, including its size and shape, may allow it to bind to multiple targets simultaneously, which could involve several of the listed genes. For example, it might interact with kinases (LCK, PTGS1) and transporters (SLC6A2, SLC6A4).
Step 5: Considering the complexity and multifunctional nature of the molecule, it is likely to be related to a few key genes that are involved in neurotransmission, signal transduction, and drug metabolism. These include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, PTGS1, and SLC6A2.
