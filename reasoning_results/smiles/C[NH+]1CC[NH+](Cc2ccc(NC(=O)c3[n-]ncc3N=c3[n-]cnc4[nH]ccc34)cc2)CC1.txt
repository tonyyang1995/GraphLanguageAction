Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+]1CC[NH+](Cc2ccc(NC(=O)c3[n-]ncc3N=c3[n-]cnc4[nH]ccc34)cc2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains multiple nitrogen atoms with positive charges, indicating it is an amine or quaternary ammonium compound. This structural feature suggests the molecule may interact with ion channels or receptors that bind to positively charged groups.
Step 2: The molecule has a complex aromatic structure, including multiple benzene rings and heterocycles (such as pyrrolidine and piperidine). These structures are often recognized by proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, particularly those containing G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH-) in the molecule indicates it could be an inhibitor or activator of enzymes like proteases or kinases, which are involved in various signaling cascades regulated by genes such as CDK2, PTGS1, and ESR1.
Step 4: The molecule's overall size and shape, along with its functional groups, suggest it might be a ligand for nuclear receptors, which are transcription factors that regulate gene expression. This is supported by the presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) and a pyrrolidine ring, both of which are common in natural ligands for nuclear receptors like NR1H2 (LXRα), NR1H3 (LXRβ), and NR1H4 (FXR).
Step 5: Considering the above structural features and potential interactions, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes involved in signal transduction, enzyme regulation, and transcriptional control. The related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, ESR1, PTGS1, LCK, MCL1, OPNK1, SIGMAR1, and SLC6A4.
