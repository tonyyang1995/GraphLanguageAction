Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [NH3+]C(CO)(CO)CO, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string [NH3+]C(CO)(CO)CO contains an amine group (-NH3+) and two carboxylic acid groups (-COOH). This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for acidic or basic functionalities.
Step 2: The presence of an amine group could indicate a possible interaction with receptors that have affinity for basic compounds, such as certain G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: Two carboxylic acid groups might allow the molecule to interact with enzymes or transporters that recognize acidic molecules, like certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP) or ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABCB).
Step 4: Considering the functional groups, the molecule could potentially interact with multiple genes involved in neurotransmission, receptor function, and drug metabolism. However, without more specific structural details, it's challenging to pinpoint exact genes.
Step 5: Based on the general pattern, the molecule may be related to genes such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ABL1, and DRD2 due to their involvement in drug metabolism and receptor function.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP1A2
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- ABL1
- DRD2
Note: This summary assumes a broad range of potential interactions based on the molecule's functional groups. Specific interactions would require more detailed analysis.
