Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOc1[n-]c(=NC(=O)Cc2cc(OC)ccc2OC)cc(N)c1C#N, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a tricyclic structure with a pyrrole ring fused to an indole ring, which is characteristic of many selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). This structural feature suggests potential interactions with serotonergic receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) and a cyano group (-CN) are notable functional groups that could contribute to the molecule's pharmacological activity. These groups may interact with various protein targets, including enzymes and receptors.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a benzene ring with a carboxamide group (-CONH2), which is common in molecules that can act as ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural element might be involved in binding to GPCRs.
Step 4: Considering the pattern of the molecule and its functional groups, it is likely to interact with several neurotransmitter-related genes. Specifically, it could influence the activity of genes encoding GPCRs, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are involved in serotonin signaling.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule's structure might also interact with genes related to cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, due to the presence of heteroaromatic rings and functional groups that are metabolized by these enzymes.
