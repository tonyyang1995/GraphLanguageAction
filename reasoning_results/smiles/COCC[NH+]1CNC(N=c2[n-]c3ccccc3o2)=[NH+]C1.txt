Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COCC[NH+]1CNC(N=c2[n-]c3ccccc3o2)=[NH+]C1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a central amine group (N+), which is a common feature for many ligands that interact with receptors such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are often involved in signal transduction pathways and are targets for various drugs.
Step 2: The presence of an aromatic ring (e.g., in the N-cyclic nitrophenyl moiety) suggests potential interactions with receptors that have binding sites for aromatic amino acids or other small molecules with similar structural motifs.
Step 3: The presence of multiple nitrogen atoms, including both primary and secondary amines, indicates that this molecule could potentially act as a partial agonist or antagonist at certain receptor sites, depending on its specific binding mode and affinity.
Step 4: Considering the gene list provided, several GPCRs are present, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. Given the structural features of the molecule, it is likely to interact with one or more of these GPCRs due to its amine groups and aromatic rings.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and the potential for interaction with GPCRs, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes encode receptors that could be targeted by the molecule.
