Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[n+]1cccc(OC(=O)[NH+](C)C)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that contains an amine group (-NH+) and an ester group (-COO-). The presence of these functional groups suggests the molecule could be an agonist or inhibitor of receptors that interact with these functional groups.
Step 2: The amine group (+NH) indicates the potential for interaction with acidic residues in protein binding sites, which might relate to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 3: The ester group (-COO) can be involved in interactions with esterases or dehydrogenases, potentially affecting enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are known to metabolize many drugs and other xenobiotics.
Step 4: Considering the structure and functionality of the molecule, it could also interact with other receptors and enzymes such as D2-like dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), and ion channels (KCNH2).
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2.
