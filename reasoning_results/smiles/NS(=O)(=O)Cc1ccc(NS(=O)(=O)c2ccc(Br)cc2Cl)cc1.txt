Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NS(=O)(=O)Cc1ccc(NS(=O)(=O)c2ccc(Br)cc2Cl)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other type of explanation.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitroso group (NS(=O)(=O)) and a benzene ring with halogen substituents (Br and Cl), which are common in drug molecules targeting receptors and transporters.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring with halogen substituents suggests potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels, such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 3: The nitroso group could also interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure might allow it to interact with serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) due to its aromatic nature.
Step 5: The molecule may also have potential interactions with voltage-gated sodium channels (KCNH2) and receptor tyrosine kinases (LCK).
Summary of related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, LCK.
