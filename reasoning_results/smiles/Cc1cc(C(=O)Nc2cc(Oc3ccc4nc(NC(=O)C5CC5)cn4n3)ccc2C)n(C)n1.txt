Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc(C(=O)Nc2cc(Oc3ccc4nc(NC(=O)C5CC5)cn4n3)ccc2C)n(C)n1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a cyano group and a pyridine ring fused to it, forming a tricyclic structure. This pattern suggests potential interactions with receptors that have similar aromatic and functional groups, such as adrenergic and cholinergic receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) and amide functionality (C(=O)N) indicates potential for inhibition of enzymes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism, like monoamine oxidases and cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Step 3: The molecule also has a benzodiazepine-like structure with a nitrogen atom and a carboxamide group, which could interact with GABA-A receptors and possibly affect signaling pathways involving these receptors.
Step 4: Given the pharmacophoric features, the molecule may interact with genes encoding enzymes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), and transporters (SLC6A2, SLC6A4).
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule might influence genes involved in signal transduction pathways (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) and receptor activity (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
