Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(Cc2c(C)nc3nc(SCC(=O)NCc4ccco4)nn3c2C)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule provided has a complex structure with multiple rings, including benzene rings, and functional groups such as amide (-CONH-), thioether (S-C-S), and ester (C=O-O-C). The presence of these functional groups suggests that the molecule could interact with proteins involved in various biological processes, particularly those related to metabolism, receptor binding, and signaling pathways.
Step 2: Analyzing the gene names given, we can identify several genes that are known to be involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmitter signaling, and hormone regulation. For example, CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) are involved in the metabolism of drugs, while G-protein coupled receptors (such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) play crucial roles in neurotransmitter signaling. Additionally, receptor-like tyrosine-protein kinases (such as KDR) and enzymes involved in hormone regulation (such as PTGS1) are also present.
Step 3: The molecule's structure with multiple functional groups and aromatic rings is indicative of its potential to bind to proteins involved in drug metabolism and signaling pathways. This is supported by the presence of CYP enzymes, which are responsible for metabolizing xenobiotics, and the G-protein coupled receptors, which are known to be modulated by various ligands.
Step 4: Furthermore, the molecule's ability to potentially form hydrogen bonds, π-π stacking interactions, and other non-covalent interactions with proteins suggests that it might interact with receptors that have similar binding sites. This aligns with the presence of genes encoding for G-protein coupled receptors and receptor-like tyrosine-protein kinases, which often require ligand binding for their activation.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmitter signaling, and hormone regulation. These include CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KDR, PTGS1, and OPRK1.
