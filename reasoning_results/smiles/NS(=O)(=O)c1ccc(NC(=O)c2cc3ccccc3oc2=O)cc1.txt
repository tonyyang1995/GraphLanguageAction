Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(NC(=O)c2cc3ccccc3oc2=O)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that is a derivative of nicotinamide (niacinamide), specifically a nicotinamide-based amide. This is evident from the presence of the "NS(=O)(=O)" segment, which indicates the presence of a nicotinamide ring with two oxygen atoms double-bonded to sulfur, forming a sulfonate ester.
Step 2: The molecule also contains an amide group ("c1ccc(NC(=O)c2cc3ccccc3oc2=O)cc1"), which is attached to the nicotinamide ring. This amide group is linked to a benzene ring through a nitrogen atom, and this nitrogen atom is also part of the amide linkage, suggesting it could be involved in binding to proteins that recognize amide groups, such as certain receptors or enzymes.
Step 3: Considering the molecular structure and its functional groups, particularly the amide and sulfonate ester functionalities, this molecule could interact with various G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other membrane proteins. GPCRs are known to bind small molecules, including amides, which can modulate their activity. Notably, some of the genes listed encode for GPCRs such as CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and HTR2A-HTR2C, which are known to interact with various ligands including amides.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of the nicotinamide moiety suggests potential interactions with enzymes that metabolize or utilize nicotinamide, such as those encoded by CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics, including those containing nicotinamide derivatives.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the following genes are potentially related to the given molecule due to their functional relevance and the interaction with molecules similar to the described structure: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These genes encode proteins that could directly or indirectly interact with the described molecule based on its chemical structure and functional groups. 
List of related genes: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CYP2C19, CYP2D6.
