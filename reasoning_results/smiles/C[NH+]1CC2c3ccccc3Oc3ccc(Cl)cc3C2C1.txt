Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+]1CC2c3ccccc3Oc3ccc(Cl)cc3C2C1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring, which is part of the amide group (-NH+) attached to an aromatic ring (Phenyl). This structure suggests the molecule could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways or receptor binding.
Step 2: The presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) and a chlorine substituent (-Cl) indicates potential for interaction with enzymes involved in metabolism or detoxification processes, such as those encoded by CYP (Cytochrome P450) genes. CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are known to metabolize drugs with similar functional groups.
Step 3: The molecule also includes an amide linkage, which can form hydrogen bonds, suggesting it might bind to receptors that utilize hydrogen bonding, like G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are encoded by genes such as DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, and CHRM1, among others.
Step 4: Given the presence of multiple rings and functional groups, the molecule may also interact with ion channels or transporters, potentially affecting genes like KCNH2 or SLC6A4, which encode for potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2 and solute carrier family 6 member 4, respectively.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and functional groups, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmission, and ion channel function, including CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, CHRM1, KCNH2, and SLC6A4.
