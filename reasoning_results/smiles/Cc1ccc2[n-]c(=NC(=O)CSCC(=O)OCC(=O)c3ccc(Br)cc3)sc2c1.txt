Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc2[n-]c(=NC(=O)CSCC(=O)OCC(=O)c3ccc(Br)cc3)sc2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a negative charge (n-), indicating it could be an anionic compound. This feature might suggest interactions with anion transporters or receptors.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a carboxamide group (-CONH-) and amide groups (-CON-), which are common in ligands for receptors such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). These functional groups could interact with various GPCRs.
Step 3: The presence of aromatic rings (indicated by the benzene ring notation 'c') suggests potential interactions with enzymes that metabolize drugs, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP enzymes).
Step 4: Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, the molecule may have diverse biological activities, potentially affecting several receptor types and metabolic pathways. However, based on the provided information, the strongest indications point towards GPCRs and enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 5: Considering the described structural features, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ABL1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CNR1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, ESR1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KDR, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
