Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a tricyclic structure with a benzene ring fused to an imidazole ring and a pyrrole ring. This structure is similar to several known ligands that interact with receptors involved in neurotransmission, such as adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors.
Step 2: The presence of amide and ester functional groups suggests potential interactions with enzymes and transporters involved in drug metabolism and signaling pathways, such as CYP2D6 and SLC6A4.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a quinolone moiety, which is known to interact with kinases like LCK, a key player in signal transduction pathways.
Step 4: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the imidazole ring could indicate potential binding to ion channels, such as KCNH2, which is involved in cardiac repolarization.
Step 5: Given the diverse functional groups and structural features, the molecule is likely to interact with multiple genes, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2D6, LCK, and KCNH2.
