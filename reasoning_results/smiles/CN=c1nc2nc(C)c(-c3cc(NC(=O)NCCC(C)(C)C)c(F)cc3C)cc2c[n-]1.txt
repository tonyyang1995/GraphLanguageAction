Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CN=c1nc2nc(C)c(-c3cc(NC(=O)NCCC(C)(C)C)c(F)cc3C)cc2c[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex molecule that includes a quinoline ring system, a phenyl ring, and a piperazine ring fused together, with additional functional groups such as amides, esters, and a fluorine atom. This molecular structure suggests the potential for interaction with various receptors and enzymes due to its diverse functional groups.
Step 2: Considering the functional groups present, particularly the amide and ester groups, this molecule could interact with enzymes involved in metabolism. Specifically, it might be related to enzymes coded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize drugs containing these functional groups.
Step 3: The presence of a quinoline ring and a phenyl ring might also indicate interactions with receptors. For example, quinoline derivatives have been shown to interact with adrenergic receptors, which are coded by ADRA1D, ADRA2B, and ADRB2. The phenyl ring could contribute to binding affinity for these receptors.
Step 4: Given the amide group, the molecule might also interact with receptors that are involved in neurotransmission, such as HTR2A (serotonin receptor), HTR2B, and HTR2C (serotonin receptors). Additionally, the presence of an amide group could suggest a potential interaction with kinases like LCK, which is coded by LCK.
Step 5: Based on the identified structural features and their potential interactions with proteins and enzymes, the related genes include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and LCK.
