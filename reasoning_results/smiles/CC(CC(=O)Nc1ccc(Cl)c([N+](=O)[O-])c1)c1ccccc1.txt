Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c([N+](=O)[O-])c1)c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex molecule that includes a benzene ring with an acetyl group, a nitrogen atom, and various substituents such as chlorine and methyl groups. This structure suggests that the molecule may have pharmacological activity, particularly related to modulating receptor binding or enzyme function.
Step 2: Analyzing the genes listed, several are known to encode receptors or enzymes that could interact with molecules possessing the described structural features. For instance, the presence of an acetyl group and a nitrogen atom might suggest interactions with cholinergic receptors, which are involved in neurotransmission. Genes encoding such receptors include CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a nitrogen atom and possibly an amide functionality could indicate potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are involved in dopamine signaling.
Step 4: Furthermore, the molecule’s structure might also interact with enzymes encoded by genes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism. These cytochrome P450 enzymes play crucial roles in the biotransformation of many pharmaceuticals.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and the potential for interaction with receptors and enzymes, the related genes include: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These genes are central to neurotransmission and drug metabolism pathways.
