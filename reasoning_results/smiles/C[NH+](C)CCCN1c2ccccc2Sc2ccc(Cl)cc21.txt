Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring and a benzene ring, which are common in many drugs that interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature may suggest potential interactions with GPCRs.
Step 2: The presence of a quaternary ammonium group (-NH+) indicates basicity, which could facilitate binding to acidic residues in the transmembrane domains of GPCRs.
Step 3: The molecule includes a phenolic group (-OH) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which can participate in hydrogen bonding and ion-dipole interactions, enhancing binding affinity to proteins.
Step 4: The overall size and shape of the molecule, along with its functional groups, might allow it to fit into the active site of certain GPCRs, particularly those involved in neurotransmitter signaling.
Step 5: Based on the molecular features and interactions, the molecule could be related to genes encoding GPCRs such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are involved in the regulation of various physiological processes including neurotransmission and hormone signaling.
