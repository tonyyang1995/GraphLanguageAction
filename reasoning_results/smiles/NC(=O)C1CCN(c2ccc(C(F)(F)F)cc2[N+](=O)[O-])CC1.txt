Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NC(=O)C1CCN(c2ccc(C(F)(F)F)cc2[N+](=O)[O-])CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a chemical compound that includes an amide group (-CONH2) and a benzene ring with various substituents such as fluoro groups (F). This structure suggests the molecule could be a drug-like entity, possibly an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring with fluoro substituities is common in many drugs targeting enzymes like CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are involved in drug metabolism. The molecule’s structure indicates it might interact with these enzymes, affecting their activity.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of an amide group and overall structure hint at potential interactions with receptors or ion channels. For instance, CYP enzymes can influence the levels of neurotransmitters, which are regulated by receptors such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C (serotonin receptors).
Step 4: Given the structure's potential to interact with CYP enzymes and affect neurotransmitter levels, the molecule may also influence genes involved in neurotransmission and receptor function, such as DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4 (cholinergic receptors), and HTR1A (serotonin receptor 1A).
Step 5: Based on the analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C.
