Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCC1(COC(=O)CCC(=O)[O-])C(=O)N(c2ccccc2)N(c2ccccc2)C1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure featuring multiple benzene rings, a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), an ester group (C=O-O-C), and a phosphate group (-PO4). These structural elements suggest that the molecule could be involved in interactions with proteins that have binding sites for similar functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of the carboxylic acid and ester groups indicates potential for binding to enzymes or receptors that recognize these functional groups. Carboxylic acids can form hydrogen bonds, while esters can interact through dipole-dipole interactions and hydrogen bonding, which are common modes of protein-ligand interactions.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a phenolic group (-OH) linked to a benzene ring, which can participate in hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding. This type of functionality is often recognized by G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly those involved in neurotransmission and hormone signaling.
Step 4: Given the diverse functional groups and potential for hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions, this molecule might interact with several GPCRs listed in the provided gene list, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and HRH1. Additionally, it could interact with other receptors like CNR1 (cannabinoid receptor 1) due to its overall structure.
Step 5: The molecule may also interact with enzymes listed, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are involved in the metabolism of various drugs and xenobiotics. However, without further detailed analysis, it is less certain how directly the molecule would interact with these enzymes compared to the GPCRs.
