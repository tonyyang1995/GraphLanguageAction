Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])c1cc2ccccc2c(Cc2c([O-])c(C(=O)[O-])cc3ccccc23)c1[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with a central carbon atom bearing an oxygen double bond (C=O) and an attached negatively charged oxygen atom (-O-), suggesting it may interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism or signaling pathways.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a cyclic amide group (C(=O)[O-]), which could potentially interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that have amine binding sites.
Step 3: The presence of multiple aromatic rings and functional groups like the carboxylate (-COOH) and ester (C(=O)-O-) moieties indicates the molecule might be a substrate for enzymes such as CYP2D6, which metabolizes drugs containing similar functional groups.
Step 4: Given the structural complexity and potential for interactions with receptors, the molecule could also influence genes related to neurotransmitter systems, such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and DRD2, which encode serotonin and dopamine receptors, respectively.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes are CYP2D6, HTR2A, HTR2B, and DRD2.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2D6, HTR2A, HTR2B, DRD2.
