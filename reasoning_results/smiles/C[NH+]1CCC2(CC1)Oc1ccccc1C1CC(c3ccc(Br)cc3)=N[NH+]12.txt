Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+]1CCC2(CC1)Oc1ccccc1C1CC(c3ccc(Br)cc3)=N[NH+]12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a nitrogen atom with an attached positive charge (N+), which suggests it could be an amine or amide derivative with basic properties. This feature might interact with proteins that have binding sites for basic compounds, such as receptors or ion channels.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a benzene ring system, which is common in many drugs and can participate in various types of interactions, including hydrogen bonding and π-π stacking. Benzene rings are often involved in the binding of ligands to protein targets, particularly in the context of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: Notably, the molecule has a quinoline-like structure (quinoline is a heterocyclic aromatic compound) and a naphthalene-like structure, both of which are known to bind to certain proteins, especially those involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways.
Step 4: Given the presence of a positively charged nitrogen and the complex aromatic structures, this molecule may interact with receptors that have basic binding sites, such as dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4). These receptors play crucial roles in various physiological processes, including neurotransmission and signal transduction.
Step 5: Additionally, due to its overall structure and potential to form hydrogen bonds and engage in hydrophobic interactions, the molecule might also be relevant to other receptors and transporters involved in neurotransmission, such as serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) and the cannabinoid receptor (CNR1).
