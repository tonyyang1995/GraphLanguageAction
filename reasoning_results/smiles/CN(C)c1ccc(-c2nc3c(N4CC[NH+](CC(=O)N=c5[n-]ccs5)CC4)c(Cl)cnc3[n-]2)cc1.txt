Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CN(C)c1ccc(-c2nc3c(N4CC[NH+](CC(=O)N=c5[n-]ccs5)CC4)c(Cl)cnc3[n-]2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains several functional groups such as amide (-CONH), amine (-NH2), and aromatic rings (benzene rings). These functional groups are often involved in interactions with proteins that have similar chemical functionalities.
Step 2: Notably, the molecule includes a pyrrolidine ring, which is characteristic of several drugs that interact with receptors or transporters. Pyrrolidine rings are known to be involved in binding to various protein targets, including G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels.
Step 3: The presence of an amide group and the overall structure suggest potential interaction with enzymes or transporters that have amine or hydroxyl groups as binding sites. For example, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 are enzymes that metabolize many drugs and may interact with molecules containing amide groups.
Step 4: The molecule also has a structure that could potentially interact with GPCR receptors, particularly those that have a high affinity for amine or hydroxyl groups, such as HTR2A (serotonin 5-HT2A receptor), HTR2B (serotonin 5-HT2B receptor), and DRD2 (dopamine D2 receptor).
Step 5: Based on the structural features and potential binding sites identified, the related genes are likely to be involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmission, and ion channel function. The related gene names include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
