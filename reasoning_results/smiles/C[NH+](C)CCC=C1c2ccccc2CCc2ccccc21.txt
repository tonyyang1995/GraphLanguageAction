Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+](C)CCC=C1c2ccccc2CCc2ccccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with multiple functional groups, including an amide group (-NH-), an aromatic ring (indicated by the benzene rings), and a quaternary ammonium salt (indicated by [NH+]). This structure suggests that the molecule could be a potential ligand or modulator for receptors or enzymes that interact with these functional groups.
Step 2: Analyzing the genes listed, we look for those that are known to be involved in the biosynthesis, metabolism, or regulation of compounds with similar functional groups. For instance, genes like CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are involved in the metabolism of various drugs and xenobiotics, which often contain aromatic rings and amide groups.
Step 3: Additionally, some of the genes listed encode for receptors or ion channels that might interact with molecules containing aromatic rings and amide groups. For example, ADRA1D and ADRA2B encode for adrenergic receptors, and CNR1 encodes for a cannabinoid receptor, both of which can bind to molecules with aromatic structures. Similarly, HTR2A and HTR2B encode for serotonin receptors, which also interact with various ligands.
Step 4: Given the presence of a quaternary ammonium salt, the molecule may also interact with cholinergic receptors, such as CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4, which are known to bind to acetylcholine-like compounds.
Step 5: Based on the structure and properties of the molecule, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CNR1, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
Summary of related genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CNR1, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
