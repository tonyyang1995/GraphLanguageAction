Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(CSc2nnnn2C)cc1[N+](=O)[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples.
Step 1: The given molecule contains a tricyclic core structure with a phenyl ring fused to a benzene ring, and an indole ring fused to the benzene ring. This structure suggests potential interactions with various receptors and enzymes involved in signal transduction and metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule, which is part of the indole ring, indicates that it may act as a ligand for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Several of the listed genes encode for GPCRs, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These receptors are known to interact with ligands that bind to their extracellular domains and induce conformational changes leading to intracellular signaling cascades.
Step 3: The molecule also has a pyridine ring attached to the phenyl ring, which could potentially interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These cytochrome P450 enzymes are responsible for metabolizing a wide range of xenobiotics, including drugs, and play a crucial role in regulating drug efficacy and toxicity.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a carboxylic acid group in the molecule, indicated by the [O-] notation, suggests that it may have inhibitory effects on certain ion channels or transporters. For instance, SLC6A2 and SLC6A4, which encode for neurotransmitter transporters, could be potential targets. Moreover, the carboxylic acid group might interact with ion channels like KCNH2, which encodes for a voltage-gated potassium channel.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, and KCNH2. These genes encode proteins that are involved in signal transduction pathways, drug metabolism, and ion channel regulation, making them potential targets for the described molecule. Step 5: List of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, KCNH2.
