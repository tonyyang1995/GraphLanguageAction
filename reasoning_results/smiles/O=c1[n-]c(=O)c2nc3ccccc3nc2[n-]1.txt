Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1[n-]c(=O)c2nc3ccccc3nc2[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing an aromatic ring system, a nitrile group (-N=C=O), and amide functionalities. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in signal transduction and receptor binding.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrile group and amide functionalities indicates the molecule could interact with enzymes such as cytochrome P450s (CYP enzymes) involved in drug metabolism. Specifically, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are known to metabolize molecules with these functional groups.
Step 3: The aromatic ring system may allow for interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Genes ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6 are associated with GPCRs that could bind to this type of molecule.
Step 4: The molecule’s structure might also interact with ion channels, as indicated by the presence of a carboxamide group which could influence voltage-gated potassium channels. CACNA1H and KCNH2 are related to calcium and potassium channels, respectively.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure, the molecule may have effects on signaling pathways involving the MAPK/ERK pathway due to its potential interaction with kinases like LCK and CDK2. Genes LCK and CDK2 are directly involved in this pathway.
