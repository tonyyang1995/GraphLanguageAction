Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(=O)Nc1ccccc1C(=O)C(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings and functional groups including an amide (C=O-N), a benzene ring (c1cccc1), and a fluorine atom (F). The presence of these features suggests that the molecule may interact with proteins involved in drug metabolism and signaling pathways.
Step 2: Considering the structure, the molecule likely contains pharmacophoric features such as aromatic regions (benzene rings) and hydrophobic/hydrophilic groups that could be recognized by receptors or enzymes. This implies potential interactions with membrane-bound proteins and metabolic enzymes.
Step 3: The molecule's ability to form hydrogen bonds (due to the amide group) and its overall shape suggest it might bind to receptors with similar binding sites. Given this, it could potentially interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other ligand-binding proteins.
Step 4: Specific genes like DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 encode for GPCRs and neurotransmitter receptors. The molecule's structure hints at possible interaction with these receptors due to its potential to form hydrogen bonds and fit into receptor binding pockets.
Step 5: Additionally, the presence of a benzene ring and amide group could indicate potential interactions with enzymes involved in phase I and II metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4.
Summary of related gene names: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4. These genes are involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism, which aligns with the molecule's structural features.
