Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C1CSC(c2ccccn2)[NH+]1c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that contains a pyrrole ring fused to a benzene ring, with a cyano group (-CN) attached to the benzene ring, and a nitro group (-NO2) also attached to the benzene ring. This structure suggests the molecule has aromatic and heteroaromatic components, which are often found in drugs targeting various receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: Analyzing the genes provided, we find that several of them are involved in neurotransmitter systems, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are serotonin receptor genes. Serotonin receptors are known to be modulated by compounds with aromatic and heteroaromatic structures, similar to the given molecule.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule’s presence of a nitro group could indicate potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, which are part of the cytochrome P450 family. These enzymes metabolize many drugs and have been associated with genetic polymorphisms that affect drug response.
Step 4: The presence of a cyano group may suggest potential interactions with ion channels, such as KCNH2, which encodes for a potassium channel subunit. Compounds with cyano groups are known to interact with various ion channels, influencing their function.
Step 5: Considering the structure and functional groups of the molecule, it is likely to interact with genes encoding neurotransmitter receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), enzymes involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C19, CYP2D6), and ion channels (KCNH2).
Summary of related gene names: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, KCNH2.
