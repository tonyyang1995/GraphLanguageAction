Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCC[NH2+]C(=O)[N-]S(=O)(=O)c1ccc(C)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a complex structure with multiple functional groups including an amide (N-H), a sulfonamide (N-SO2), and aromatic rings. These features suggest the molecule could have interactions with proteins that bind to or are influenced by such chemical structures.
Step 2: Among the provided genes, several are involved in neurotransmitter systems and receptors, which might interact with molecules containing amide and sulfonamide groups. For instance, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C are serotonin receptors, and DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4 are dopamine receptors. These receptors often bind to small molecules with similar functional groups.
Step 3: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in the molecule suggests it might also interact with enzymes or transporters that are involved in drug metabolism. Genes like CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 encode cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are crucial for metabolizing drugs.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule’s structure includes a benzene ring, which is common in many drug molecules. Genes such as ABCB1, which encodes P-glycoprotein, play a role in the efflux of drugs from cells, potentially making them relevant if the molecule is a substrate or inhibitor of this protein.
Step 5: Based on the chemical structure and the potential for interaction with specific functional groups, the related genes include: HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, and ABCB1. These genes are associated with neurotransmitter receptors and drug metabolism pathways.
