Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)C1CCC[NH+](C(=O)C2CC[NH+](S(=O)(=O)CC)CC2)C1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring, which is part of its core structure. This feature is often associated with ligands that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4. These genes encode receptors that typically bind to small molecules like neurotransmitters.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a carboxamide group (-CONH-) and a sulfonate ester group (-SO3-). These functional groups suggest potential interactions with enzymes or transporters. CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 are involved in the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics, making them relevant candidates for interaction with this molecule.
Step 3: The presence of a phenyl ring and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) indicates the molecule could have affinity for receptors or enzymes involved in pain modulation. CNR1 and SIGMAR1 are associated with endocannabinoid signaling and may be relevant due to the presence of aromatic rings.
Step 4: The molecule’s structure includes a quinoline-like moiety, which is similar to compounds known to interact with HRH1, a receptor involved in histamine signaling.
Step 5: The overall structure suggests potential interactions with multiple targets, including GPCRs and metabolic enzymes. Based on the structural analysis, the related genes are ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CNR1, SIGMAR1, and HRH1. 
Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CNR1, SIGMAR1, HRH1.
