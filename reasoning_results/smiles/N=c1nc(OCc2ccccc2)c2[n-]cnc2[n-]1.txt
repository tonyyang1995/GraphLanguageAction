Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N=c1nc(OCc2ccccc2)c2[n-]cnc2[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure containing a nitrogen atom double-bonded to a carbon atom (N=C), which indicates it may have aromatic or heterocyclic properties. It also includes a nitrogen atom with a negative charge (-) and an oxygen atom bonded to a carbon ring, suggesting potential for interaction with proteins involved in neurotransmitter transport or receptor binding.
Step 2: The presence of multiple nitrogen atoms and a negatively charged nitrogen could indicate that this molecule might interact with receptors that bind ligands containing nitrogen, such as monoamines. This aligns with several genes listed, including HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode serotonin receptors.
Step 3: The molecule's structure, particularly the presence of aromatic rings and heteroatoms like nitrogen and oxygen, suggests potential for interaction with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These enzymes are known to metabolize many drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 4: Given the presence of a benzene ring and a cyclic amine, the molecule might be able to interact with ion channels or voltage-gated channels, which are encoded by genes like KCNH2. This is because such molecules can modulate the function of ion channels by binding to their extracellular or intracellular domains.
Step 5: The overall structure of the molecule, with its aromatic rings, heteroatoms, and possible charge distribution, suggests it could be a substrate for transporters or enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways. Genes such as SLC6A2, SLC6A4, and PTGS1 (encoding cyclooxygenase) could be relevant due to their roles in neurotransmitter uptake and prostaglandin synthesis, respectively.
Summary of Related Gene Names:
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6
- KCNH2
- SLC6A2, SLC6A4, PTGS1
These genes are likely to be involved in processes that could be affected by the molecule's structure and properties.
