Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)OC(=O)C1=C[NH+](C(=O)c2ccc(F)c(F)c2)CC(C)(C)c2c1[nH]c1ccccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure that includes a benzene ring with various substituents such as methyl groups, fluorine atoms, and an amide group. The presence of a benzene ring with multiple substituents suggests this molecule could potentially interact with proteins involved in cell signaling pathways.
Step 2: Notably, the molecule contains a quinolone-like structure (quinoline-3-carboxylic acid), which is known to be involved in various biological processes including receptor modulation and enzyme inhibition. This structural feature might suggest potential interactions with receptors and enzymes encoded by certain genes.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a benzodiazepine-like structure, indicating possible interactions with GABA-A receptors, which are encoded by genes like GABRA1, GABRA2, GABRG1, and GABRD. However, none of the provided genes match these receptors directly.
Step 4: Given the presence of a carboxamide group and the overall structure, the molecule might interact with enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs and xenobiotics. Among the provided genes, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 are relevant.
Step 5: The molecule's structure does not directly suggest interactions with the other listed genes such as those encoding receptors for adrenergic, cholinergic, and dopaminergic systems, or other signaling pathways without further context.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP3A4
These genes are likely the closest matches based on the molecule's structure and potential for enzyme interaction. Other genes listed may not have a direct relationship with this particular molecule based on the given information. However, it's important to note that the actual biological activity of the molecule would require experimental validation.
