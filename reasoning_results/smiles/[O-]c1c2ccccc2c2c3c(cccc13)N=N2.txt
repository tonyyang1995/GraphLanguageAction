Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [O-]c1c2ccccc2c2c3c(cccc13)N=N2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom double-bonded to a carbon atom (N=), which suggests it may interact with proteins that have binding sites for such functional groups. This pattern is relevant to receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a cyclic structure with multiple carbon atoms (cyclohexane-like) indicates potential interactions with membrane-bound proteins or receptors, particularly those involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 3: The molecule also includes an amine group (-N=), which could be recognized by various protein receptors and enzymes, especially those involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling and drug targets.
Step 4: Given the structural features, the molecule might interact with genes encoding proteins involved in neurotransmitter systems, receptor signaling, and drug metabolism. Specific genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, and HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6 are likely to be relevant due to their roles in GPCR signaling and neurotransmission.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule’s potential to influence drug metabolism makes CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 relevant, as they are involved in the biotransformation of drugs and xenobiotics.
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
