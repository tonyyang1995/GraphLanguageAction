Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)n1cnc2c(=NCc3ccccc3)[n-]c(=NCCCO)[n-]c21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains multiple nitrogen atoms and aromatic rings, suggesting potential interactions with proteins that have similar structural elements, such as receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a pyrrole ring and a nitro group could indicate a molecule that might interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, like those encoded by CYP (Cytochrome P450) genes.
Step 3: The molecule's structure includes a tricyclic core, which might suggest a potential interaction with receptors that have similar structures, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), represented by genes like DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 4: The molecule's overall shape and functional groups may also suggest it could interact with ion channels, indicated by genes like KCNH2.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structural features, the most likely related genes are: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and KCNH2. Step 5: Related Gene Names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2.
