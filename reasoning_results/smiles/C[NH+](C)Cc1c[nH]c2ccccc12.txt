Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+](C)Cc1c[nH]c2ccccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a structure that includes an amine group (NH+) attached to a nitrogen atom, which is part of a cyclic amide (N-C-C) motif. This structural feature is characteristic of certain neurotransmitters and ligands that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly those involved in the modulation of neuronal signaling.
Step 2: The presence of a phenyl ring (C6H5) and multiple aromatic rings (such as in the [nH]c2ccccc12 fragment) suggests that this molecule may be capable of interacting with receptors that have a preference for aromatic ligands, such as certain GPCRs.
Step 3: The cyclic amide and aromatic features are common in molecules that act as agonists or antagonists for GPCRs like adrenergic receptors (e.g., ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and dopaminergic receptors (e.g., DRD2, DRD3, DRD4).
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a positively charged amine group (NH+) indicates that the molecule could be a cationic ligand, which is often recognized by ionotropic receptors and transporters, such as the cholinergic receptors (e.g., CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4) and the cannabinoid receptor (CNR1).
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the genes encoding for adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), cholinergic receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), and the cannabinoid receptor (CNR1).
Summary of related gene names:
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- ADRB2
- DRD2
- DRD3
- DRD4
- CHRM1
- CHRM3
- CHRM4
- CNR1 Step 1: The molecule contains an amine group (NH+) attached to a nitrogen atom, which is typical of many small molecules that interact with biological targets.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a phenyl ring and multiple aromatic rings, suggesting it might interact with receptors that prefer aromatic ligands.
Step 3: These structural features are commonly found in molecules that bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors.
Step 4: The positively charged amine group indicates the molecule could interact with ion channels or transporters, such as cholinergic receptors and the cannabinoid receptor.
Step 5: Therefore, the molecule is likely related to genes encoding adrenergic (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), dopaminergic (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), cholinergic (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), and cannabinoid (CNR1) receptors.
