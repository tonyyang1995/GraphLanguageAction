Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C=CCn1c(=O)c2c[n-]c(=Nc3ccc(N4CC[NH+](C)CC4)cc3)nc2n1-c1cccc(C(C)(C)O)n1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with a double bond (C=CC), which suggests it may interact with enzymes or receptors that are involved in signal transduction pathways or metabolic processes. This structure is often found in ligands that bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 2: Additionally, the presence of an amide group (c(=O)c2) indicates potential interaction with enzymes such as cytochrome P450s (CYPs), which are involved in drug metabolism. The amide group could also suggest binding affinity for certain receptors or ion channels.
Step 3: The molecule has a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (n1c(=O)c2c[n-]), which is characteristic of amines. Amines can act as ligands for various receptors, including GPCRs and ion channels, particularly those involved in neurotransmission.
Step 4: Given the presence of multiple aromatic rings and functional groups, this molecule could potentially interact with a variety of enzymes and receptors. However, its specific interactions would depend on the detailed structure and electronic properties, which are not fully captured by the SMILES string alone.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and functional groups present, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways. These include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and SIGMAR1, all of which encode for GPCRs or their associated proteins. Additionally, it might have interactions with CYP2D6, given its amide functionality, which plays a role in drug metabolism.
