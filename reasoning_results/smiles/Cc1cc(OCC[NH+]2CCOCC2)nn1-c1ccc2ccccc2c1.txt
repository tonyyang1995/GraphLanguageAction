Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc(OCC[NH+]2CCOCC2)nn1-c1ccc2ccccc2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with an amide group (-CONH+) and an ester group (-COO-), indicating it is likely an amide-based drug with potential for receptor interactions. This structure could interact with receptors that have similar functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (+NH+) suggests the molecule might be an agonist or partial agonist for certain receptors, such as those with a positively charged binding site. This feature aligns with the characteristics of several G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: Given the pattern of substituents around the benzene ring, this molecule could potentially bind to and modulate the activity of adrenergic receptors (adrenoceptors), such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, and other adrenergic receptors. These receptors are involved in the regulation of heart rate, blood pressure, and other physiological processes.
Step 4: The presence of an oxygenated heterocyclic ring, possibly a pyrrole or furan, may contribute to the molecule's ability to interact with receptors that have a specific affinity for such structures. This feature could be relevant to receptors like HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are involved in serotonin signaling and mood regulation.
Step 5: Based on the structural features described, the molecule is most likely related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6. These genes encode receptors that are involved in various physiological and psychological functions, including the regulation of heart rate, blood pressure, and mood. The molecule's structure suggests it could act as an agonist or modulator for these receptors.
