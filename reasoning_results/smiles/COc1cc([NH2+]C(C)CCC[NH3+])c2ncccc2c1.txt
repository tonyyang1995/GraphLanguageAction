Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc([NH2+]C(C)CCC[NH3+])c2ncccc2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is part of the tricyclic amine structure. This type of structure is often associated with ligands that interact with neurotransmitter receptors, particularly those involved in the regulation of mood and pain. 
Step 2: The presence of a positively charged amine group (N+) suggests the molecule may act as a cationic ligand. Such ligands can bind to ion channels or receptors that are activated by changes in ionic permeability or charge, like adrenergic and cholinergic receptors.
Step 3: The tricyclic amine structure is known to interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4). These receptors are involved in various physiological processes including heart rate, blood pressure, and neurotransmission.
Step 4: The molecule's positive charge and aromatic structure also suggest potential interactions with voltage-gated potassium channels (e.g., KCNH2), which could modulate their activity, affecting cellular excitability and ion transport.
Step 5: Given the molecule's structural features and the described interactions, it is most likely related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, KCNH2. These genes encode receptors and ion channels that could be targeted by the molecule based on its chemical structure and properties.
