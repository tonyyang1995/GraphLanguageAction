Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CN1c2ccccc2N(C)C1(C)c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with a central nitrogen atom (N) that forms a cyclic ring with five carbon atoms (c), followed by another cyclic ring containing nitrogen and carbon atoms. This pattern suggests the presence of a benzene-like ring system, which is often found in molecules that interact with receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The cyclic nature of the molecule, particularly the presence of aromatic rings, indicates potential interactions with proteins that have hydrophobic binding pockets, such as those found in G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are known to be involved in signal transduction pathways and are targets for many drugs.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a pyrrole group (N(C)C1(C)c1ccccc1), which is known to be involved in various biological processes, including neurotransmission and hormone signaling. This structural feature may suggest interactions with receptors or enzymes involved in these processes.
Step 4: Considering the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the molecule could be related to genes encoding receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and hormone signaling. Specifically, this includes genes such as DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), HTR1A (serotonin receptor 1A), HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A), and CHRM1 (cholinergic receptor muscarinic M1).
Step 5: Based on the analysis of the molecule's structure and its potential interactions, the related genes include:
- DRD2
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- CHRM1
These genes encode receptors and proteins that are likely to interact with the given molecule due to its structural features and potential pharmacological activities. Step 5: Based on the analysis of the molecule's structure and its potential interactions, the related genes include:
These genes encode receptors and proteins that are likely to interact with the given molecule due to its structural features and potential pharmacological activities. The molecule's benzene-like ring system and pyrrole group suggest interactions with these specific receptors and enzymes.
