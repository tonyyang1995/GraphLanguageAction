Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cccc(-c2nnc3n2N=C(C(C)(C)C)CS3)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule, which appears to be a benzodiazepine derivative. Benzodiazepines are known for their ability to interact with GABAA receptors, particularly with the benzodiazepine binding site. This interaction is mediated by the GABAA receptor subunits, which are encoded by various genes.
Step 2: The molecule contains a benzene ring, which is a common feature in many drugs that interact with GABAA receptors. Additionally, it has a diazepine ring, which is characteristic of benzodiazepines and contributes to their pharmacological activity by enhancing the effect of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), an inhibitory neurotransmitter.
Step 3: Given the molecular structure and its potential interaction with GABAA receptors, the molecule could be related to genes encoding GABAA receptor subunits. These include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. However, since the primary function of benzodiazepines is to modulate GABAergic transmission, the most relevant genes would likely be those involved in GABAA receptor function and regulation.
Step 4: The molecule may also interact with other genes involved in neurotransmission pathways, such as CYP2D6, which is involved in the metabolism of several psychoactive substances, including benzodiazepines. Other genes like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which encode dopamine receptors, might also be indirectly related due to their role in the broader neuropharmacological context.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes can be summarized as follows: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4. These genes are crucial for understanding the pharmacological effects and potential side effects of the molecule.
