Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)CC(NC(=O)c1cccs1)c1ccc(OCC)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring, an amide group (-CO-N), and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). These functional groups are common in ligands that interact with receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring suggests potential interactions with aromatic amino acids or proteins containing such motifs, which could be relevant for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and HRH1.
Step 3: The amide and carboxylic acid functionalities indicate potential interactions with enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: Given the complexity of the molecule, it also has potential to interact with multiple targets, including ABCB1, which encodes a multidrug resistance protein, and SLC6A2 and SLC6A4, which are transporters that might be affected by the molecule's structure.
Step 5: The molecule likely interacts with several genes involved in neurotransmission, drug metabolism, and signal transduction pathways.
