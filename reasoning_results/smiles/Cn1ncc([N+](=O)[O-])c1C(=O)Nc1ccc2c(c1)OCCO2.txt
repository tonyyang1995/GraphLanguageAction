Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cn1ncc([N+](=O)[O-])c1C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(c1)OCCO2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex structure containing several functional groups such as amide, ester, and aromatic rings. It also includes a pyrrolidine ring with a nitrogen atom that carries a positive charge and an oxygen atom that carries a negative charge. This structure suggests the molecule may have pharmacological activity, possibly as an agonist or antagonist at certain receptors.
Step 2: Analyzing the molecular structure for potential receptor interactions, we observe that the amide group could be involved in hydrogen bonding, which is a common interaction mode for many ligands binding to receptors. Additionally, the presence of aromatic rings might suggest the molecule could interact with receptors that have hydrophobic binding pockets, such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: Considering the pattern of the molecule and its potential to interact with receptors, we can identify several genes associated with GPCRs. These include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, and ADRB2. The first three encode for adrenergic receptors, while ABL1 encodes for the Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1, which is involved in signal transduction pathways that can affect cell growth and differentiation.
Step 4: The molecule's structure also suggests it might interact with enzymes or transporters, given the presence of functional groups like esters and amides. This leads us to consider genes related to drug metabolism and transport, such as CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and SLC6A4. These genes are involved in the metabolism and transport of various drugs, including those that act on GPCRs.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names based on the molecule's structure and potential interactions, we have: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and SLC6A4. These genes are involved in signaling pathways and drug metabolism, which could be influenced by the molecule's pharmacological activity.
