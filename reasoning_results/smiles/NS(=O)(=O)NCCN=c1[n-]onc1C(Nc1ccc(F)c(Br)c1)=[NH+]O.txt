Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NS(=O)(=O)NCCN=c1[n-]onc1C(Nc1ccc(F)c(Br)c1)=[NH+]O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyridine ring system with a quinoline moiety, which is characteristic of several psychoactive compounds and may interact with receptors that modulate neurotransmitter function.
Step 2: The presence of a quaternary ammonium group and an amide functionality suggests potential interactions with ion channels, particularly those involved in calcium and sodium signaling, such as KCNH2 and CACNA1H.
Step 3: The molecule includes a phenyl ring with fluorine and bromine substituents, which could interact with various membrane proteins and receptors, including G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 4: The overall structure indicates possible interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, due to the presence of heteroaromatic systems and amide bonds.
Step 5: Given the molecular features, the most likely related genes are: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, KCNH2, CACNA1H, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6.
Summary of related genes: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, KCNH2, CACNA1H, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6. Step 1: The molecule contains a pyridine ring system with a quinoline moiety, which is characteristic of several psychoactive compounds and may interact with receptors that modulate neurotransmitter function.
