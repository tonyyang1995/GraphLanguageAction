Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Nc1cccc(Cl)c1)Nn1cnnc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that includes a pyrrolidine ring system, a nitrile group (-CN), and an amide group (-CONH-). These structural features suggest the molecule may interact with proteins involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction, as these functional groups are often found in ligands for receptors and enzymes related to these processes.
Step 2: Analyzing the SMILES string further, the presence of a nitrile group (-CN) and a pyrrolidine ring indicates potential interactions with enzymes such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are involved in the metabolism of various drugs and xenobiotics through the hydroxylation and oxidation reactions.
Step 3: Considering the amide group (-CONH-) and the overall molecular structure, this compound might be able to act as a ligand for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Specifically, it could potentially bind to HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A), HTR2B (serotonin receptor 2B), and HTR2C (serotonin receptor 2C), which are known to have amide-containing ligands.
Step 4: The presence of a pyrrolidine ring also suggests possible interactions with voltage-gated potassium channels, as these channels contain binding sites for compounds with similar structures. For instance, KCNH2 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2) could be a relevant target due to its binding affinity for similar ligands.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related genes to the molecule include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and KCNH2.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- KCNH2
