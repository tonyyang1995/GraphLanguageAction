Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCSc1nnc(-c2ccncc2)o1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule, represented by the SMILES string "CCSc1nnc(-c2ccncc2)o1," contains several aromatic rings and heteroatoms such as nitrogen and oxygen. This complex structure suggests it could interact with proteins that have binding sites for similar chemical motifs.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen-nitrogen double bond (NN) and multiple aromatic rings indicates potential interactions with enzymes or receptors that recognize such structural elements. For example, cytochrome P450 enzymes (like CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6) are known to metabolize drugs containing aromatic and heterocyclic structures, suggesting a possible interaction with these enzymes.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule's ability to form hydrogen bonds due to the presence of nitrogen atoms might allow it to bind to receptors with hydrophobic cavities or charged residues, such as those found in G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4 are known targets for molecules with similar structural features.
Step 4: The overall topology of the molecule, including its aromaticity and potential for hydrogen bonding, also suggests it may influence ion channels or transporters. For instance, the molecule could interact with ion channels such as KCNH2 or transporters like SLC6A2 and SLC6A4, which are involved in neurotransmitter reuptake and metabolism.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the related genes to this molecule are likely to be those encoding enzymes involved in drug metabolism (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6), GPCRs (e.g., ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), and ion channels or transporters (e.g., KCNH2, SLC6A2, SLC6A4).
