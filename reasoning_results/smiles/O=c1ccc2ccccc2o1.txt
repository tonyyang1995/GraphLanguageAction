Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1ccc2ccccc2o1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule, O=c1ccc2ccccc2o1, corresponds to the chemical structure of Resveratrol. Resveratrol is a polyphenolic compound found in grapes, red wine, and other plants. It has a benzene ring system with a trans-stilbene moiety, which includes a double bond and an alcohol group.
Step 2: Resveratrol is known for its potential biological activities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer properties. These activities are linked to its ability to interact with various enzymes and receptors.
Step 3: One of the key enzymes that might be influenced by Resveratrol is CYP2D6, a member of the cytochrome P450 family involved in drug metabolism. Resveratrol can act as a substrate or inhibitor of CYP2D6, affecting the metabolism of drugs metabolized by this enzyme.
Step 4: Additionally, Resveratrol has been shown to modulate the activity of several G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels. For example, it can interact with HTR2A (serotonin 5-HT2A receptor), HRH1 (histamine H1 receptor), and KCNH2 (potassium channel subfamily H member 2).
Step 5: Based on the above points, the genes directly or indirectly related to Resveratrol include CYP2D6, HTR2A, HRH1, and KCNH2.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2D6
- HTR2A
- HRH1
- KCNH2 Step 1: The molecule in question is Resveratrol, which has a benzene ring system with a trans-stilbene moiety.
