Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc[n-]c1=NC1(C(F)(F)F)[NH+]=C(c2ccccc2)NC1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (N+), which suggests it could interact with negatively charged regions of proteins, potentially affecting ion channels or receptors.
Step 2: The presence of fluoro groups (F) indicates the molecule may have specific interactions with certain enzymes or receptors that recognize fluorine atoms.
Step 3: The aromatic ring system and amide group suggest the molecule could interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those coded by CYP enzymes.
Step 4: The presence of a quinoline-like structure could indicate potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like DRD2, HTR1A, and HTR2A.
Step 5: Given the structure and functional groups, the molecule is likely related to the following genes: CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A. Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (N+), which suggests it could interact with negatively charged regions of proteins, potentially affecting ion channels or receptors.
Step 5: Given the structure and functional groups, the molecule is likely related to the following genes: CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A. 
Summary of Related Genes: CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A.
