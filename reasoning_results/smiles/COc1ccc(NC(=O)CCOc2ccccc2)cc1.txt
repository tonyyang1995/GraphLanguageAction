Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound with a benzene ring containing a nitrogen atom (indicated by the 'N' in the SMILES string), which is part of a larger structure that includes an amide group (-CO-NH-). This indicates the molecule could potentially interact with proteins that have similar functional groups, such as enzymes or receptors.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group in the molecule suggests it might be involved in interactions with proteins that contain amine or carboxylic acid residues, which are common in many receptor proteins and enzymes. Specifically, this could relate to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYPs).
Step 3: The structure of the molecule also includes a benzene ring, which is known to be involved in binding to various types of receptors and enzymes, particularly those that modulate ion channels and neurotransmitter systems. This feature could be relevant to genes encoding for ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors.
Step 4: Considering the potential interaction with enzymes and receptors, the molecule may be related to genes that encode for proteins involved in drug metabolism and signaling pathways. This includes genes like CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize drugs, and genes like HTR2A, HTR2B, and DRD2, which are involved in serotonin and dopamine signaling respectively.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule could be related to the following genes: CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, and DRD2. These genes are involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmitter signaling, which aligns with the molecular structure of the compound.
