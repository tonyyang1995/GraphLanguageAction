Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [O-]c1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2cccnc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains multiple chlorine atoms and aromatic rings, which are common in drugs that interact with various receptors and ion channels. This suggests potential interactions with genes encoding receptors and ion channels.
Step 2: The presence of nitrogen atoms, particularly in a heterocyclic ring system, indicates possible interactions with genes involved in neurotransmitter transport and signaling pathways.
Step 3: The aromatic ring structure could be relevant to genes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoding cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Step 4: The overall structure does not strongly suggest direct interaction with specific neurotransmitter receptors but may influence their function through indirect mechanisms.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule might be related to the following genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
