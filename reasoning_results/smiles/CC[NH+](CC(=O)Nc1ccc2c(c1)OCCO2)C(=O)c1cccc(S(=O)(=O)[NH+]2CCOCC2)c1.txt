Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC[NH+](CC(=O)Nc1ccc2c(c1)OCCO2)C(=O)c1cccc(S(=O)(=O)[NH+]2CCOCC2)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a quinoline ring system, which is a common pharmacophore for several G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as adrenergic, muscarinic, and dopaminergic receptors. This structural feature suggests potential interactions with adrenergic (ADRA1D, ADRA2B) and dopaminergic (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) receptor families.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a benzothiazole moiety, which is known to interact with various receptors, including muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4). The presence of this functional group indicates possible binding to muscarinic receptors.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule has a pyrrolidine ring fused to a benzene ring, which is often involved in ligand binding to ion channels and transporters. This structure could potentially interact with ion channels (KCNH2) and transporters like SLC6A2 and SLC6A4.
Step 4: The molecule’s overall structure, particularly its amide and ester functionalities, could indicate potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.
Step 5: The related genes are ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, KCNH2, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, KCNH2, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
