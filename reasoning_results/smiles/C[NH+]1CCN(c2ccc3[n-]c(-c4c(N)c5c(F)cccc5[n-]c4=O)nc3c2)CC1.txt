Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+]1CCN(c2ccc3[n-]c(-c4c(N)c5c(F)cccc5[n-]c4=O)nc3c2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this information might be useful.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (NH+), which suggests it could interact with negatively charged sites on proteins, potentially affecting ion channels or receptors.
Step 2: The presence of multiple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene rings in the structure) indicates the molecule has the potential to form hydrogen bonds and stabilize protein-ligand interactions through π-π stacking.
Step 3: The molecule includes a carboxyl group (-COOH), which can participate in hydrogen bonding and may be recognized by enzymes or receptors involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 4: Given the complex structure and the presence of functional groups like amine, carboxyl, and aromatic rings, the molecule likely interacts with proteins involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways, such as receptors and enzymes.
Step 5: Based on the interaction patterns and functional groups, the molecule is most likely to be related to genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), enzymes involved in signal transduction, and receptors that modulate neurotransmitter activity.
