Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(=O)c1ccc(-n2c(CCC(=O)[O-])ccc2-c2cccs2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with an acetyl group and a nitrile group, which are characteristic of certain ligands that can interact with receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrile group (-CN) suggests potential binding to proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The structure includes a pyrrole ring, which could indicate interactions with enzymes like CYP2D6, known for metabolizing drugs through oxidation reactions involving pyrrole rings.
Step 4: The molecule's overall structure and functional groups may also suggest interactions with ion channels, particularly those containing cysteine residues, hinting at possible interactions with genes like KCNH2.
Step 5: Given the potential for drug-like interactions with receptors and enzymes, the related genes include ABL1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CYP2D6, KCNH2, and DRD2.
Related genes: ABL1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CYP2D6, KCNH2, DRD2.
