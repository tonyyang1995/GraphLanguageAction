Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: c1ccc(CN=c2[n-]cnc3[n-]cnc23)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound that contains multiple rings and functional groups, including a pyrrole ring, a benzene ring, and amine and nitrile functionalities. These structural features are indicative of a small molecule that could interact with various proteins.
Step 2: Considering the presence of a nitrile group (-CN) and an amine group (-NH2), this molecule might be capable of forming hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions with proteins containing amino acid residues such as lysine (Lys), arginine (Arg), or glutamine (Gln). This suggests potential binding sites for proteins involved in neurotransmitter signaling and receptor interactions.
Step 3: The molecule's aromatic rings and polar functional groups could also interact with transmembrane proteins that have hydrophobic cores and charged regions. This is relevant for genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels, which often contain such domains.
Step 4: Notably, the presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (pyrrole) and amine groups indicates that the molecule could potentially modulate the activity of enzymes and receptors involved in neurotransmitter metabolism and signaling pathways. This aligns with the functionality of several genes listed, particularly those involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the following genes are likely to be related to the described molecule: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HRH1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, SLC6A2, SLC6A4. These genes encode proteins that are involved in neurotransmitter synthesis, degradation, and receptor function, making them plausible targets for the described molecule.
