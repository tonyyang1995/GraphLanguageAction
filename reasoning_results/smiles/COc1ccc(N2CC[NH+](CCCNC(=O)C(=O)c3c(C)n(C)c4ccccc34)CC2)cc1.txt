Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(N2CC[NH+](CCCNC(=O)C(=O)c3c(C)n(C)c4ccccc34)CC2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure that includes a pyrrole ring fused to an aromatic ring, a nitrogen atom bearing a positive charge, and a series of hydrophobic chains and rings. This structure suggests the molecule may be an inhibitor or modulator of ion channels or receptors.
Step 2: Among the listed genes, several are known to be involved in the expression and function of ion channels or receptors, which could interact with the molecule due to its structure. These include KCNH2 (encoding a potassium channel subunit), HTR1A (a serotonin receptor), and HRH1 (a histamine receptor).
Step 3: The presence of a positively charged nitrogen group and multiple hydrophobic chains in the molecule might allow it to interact with transmembrane proteins such as ion channels and receptors. This interaction could modulate their activity, affecting cellular signaling pathways.
Step 4: The potential interactions of this molecule with ion channels and receptors suggest it could influence neurotransmission and other physiological processes mediated by these proteins. Given the listed genes, the most likely related genes would be those encoding for ion channels and receptors.
Step 5: Based on the structure and potential functions of the molecule, the related genes are: KCNH2, HTR1A, and HRH1. 
Summary of related gene names:
- KCNH2
- HTR1A
- HRH1 Step 5: Summary of related gene names:
- HRH1
These genes encode for ion channels and receptors that could potentially interact with the given molecular structure.
