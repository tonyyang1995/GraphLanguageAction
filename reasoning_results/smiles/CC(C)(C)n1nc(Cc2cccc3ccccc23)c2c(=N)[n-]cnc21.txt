Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)(C)n1nc(Cc2cccc3ccccc23)c2c(=N)[n-]cnc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule, represented by the SMILES string, contains a benzene ring with substituents including a pyridine ring, a nitrile group, and a quinoline-like structure. This complex aromatic pattern suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrile group (-CN) and the overall structure are characteristic of molecules that could inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes, specifically CYP2D6 and CYP2C9. These enzymes play crucial roles in metabolizing many drugs, including those that affect neurotransmitters.
Step 3: Given the aromatic and potentially bioactive nature of the molecule, it may also interact with receptors such as DRD2 (Dopamine D2 receptor), which is involved in dopamine signaling and is associated with conditions like schizophrenia and Parkinson’s disease.
Step 4: The molecule's structure might also suggest potential interactions with the HTR2A (Serotonin 5-HT2A receptor) due to its complex aromatic system, which could influence serotonin signaling pathways.
Step 5: Considering the above points, the molecule could be related to the following genes: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, DRD2, and HTR2A.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2D6
- CYP2C9
- DRD2
- HTR2A Step 5: Summary of related gene names:
- HTR2A
These genes are relevant due to the molecule's potential to interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism and receptors that modulate neurotransmitter function.
