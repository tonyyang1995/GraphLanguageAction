Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCn1nc(C(=O)[O-])c(=O)c2cc3c(cc21)OCO3, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a nitrogen heterocycle (indicated by "n1...n1"), a carboxylate group (-COO-), and a phosphate group (-OPO3). This structure suggests it could be a small molecule inhibitor or modulator of certain enzymes or receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylate group (-COO-) and a phosphate group (-OPO3) indicates that this molecule might interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or ion channels, which are known to have binding sites for acidic and phosphorylated compounds.
Step 3: Among the listed genes, several are associated with GPCRs or enzymes that may interact with acidic or phosphorylated molecules. These include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which encode enzymes involved in drug metabolism and receptor signaling.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure could potentially interact with voltage-gated calcium channels, as indicated by the presence of a carboxylate group, which might bind to the selectivity filter of these channels. This suggests a possible interaction with CACNA1H, which encodes a voltage-gated calcium channel.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis and the potential interactions with various protein targets, the related genes are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CACNA1H, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. 
Summary of Related Genes:
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- ABL1
- CACNA1H
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4 Step 5: Summary of Related Genes:
- CYP3A4
The molecule likely interacts with these genes due to its chemical structure, which includes carboxylate and phosphate groups that can bind to specific protein targets, particularly those involved in signal transduction and drug metabolism.
