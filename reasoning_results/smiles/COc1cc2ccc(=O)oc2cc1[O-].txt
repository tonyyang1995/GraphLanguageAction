Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc2ccc(=O)oc2cc1[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string (COc1cc2ccc(=O)oc2cc1[O-]) represents a chemical structure that can be identified as an oxazoline derivative, specifically an oxazoline carboxylate ester. This structure contains a heterocyclic ring (oxazoline), a carbonyl group (-CO-), and a negatively charged oxygen atom ([O-]), which are key structural elements.
Step 2: The presence of a heterocyclic ring and a carbonyl group in this molecule suggests potential interactions with proteins that bind to or recognize such functional groups. These proteins could include enzymes or receptors involved in signal transduction pathways or drug metabolism.
Step 3: Notably, the oxazoline moiety and the negatively charged oxygen suggest possible binding to ion channels or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). For instance, certain GPCRs have affinity for acidic or polar ligands, and the oxazoline ring might interact with the hydrophobic or hydrophilic regions of these receptors.
Step 4: Given the molecular structure, it could potentially interact with genes encoding for GPCRs such as HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are involved in serotonin signaling, or CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4, which are muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Additionally, it might interact with CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 5: Based on the analysis, the related genes that could be associated with this molecule are: HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These genes encode proteins that may directly or indirectly interact with the described molecular structure.
