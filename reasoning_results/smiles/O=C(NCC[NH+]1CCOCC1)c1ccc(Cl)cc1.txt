Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(NCC[NH+]1CCOCC1)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound with a central carbon atom double-bonded to oxygen (O=C), and it contains several functional groups including an amide group (-CONH), a phenyl ring (c1ccc(Cl)cc1), and an aromatic ring with a chlorine substituent. The presence of these features suggests that the molecule could interact with proteins involved in neurotransmission, metabolism, and signaling pathways.
Step 2: The aromatic rings, particularly the phenyl group and the substituted benzene ring, are characteristic of many drugs that target receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction. This is relevant to several of the listed genes, which encode for receptors and enzymes that play crucial roles in these processes.
Step 3: The amide group (-CONH) is a common functional group found in many bioactive molecules, including ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Among the listed genes, several are known to encode for GPCRs such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These receptors are involved in various physiological functions, including the regulation of mood, pain perception, and autonomic nervous system activity.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a chlorine atom in the substituted benzene ring could indicate potential electrophilic reactivity, which might be relevant for enzymes involved in phase I drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These enzymes are important for the biotransformation of xenobiotics and endogenous compounds.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions with proteins and enzymes, the related genes are likely to include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6. These genes encode for proteins that are directly or indirectly involved in the molecular targets of the described molecule.
