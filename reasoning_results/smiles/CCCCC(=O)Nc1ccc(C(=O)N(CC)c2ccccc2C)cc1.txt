Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCC(=O)Nc1ccc(C(=O)N(CC)c2ccccc2C)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other type of explanation.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with an amide group attached to it. This structural feature is characteristic of many drugs that interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are involved in signaling pathways controlled by various genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a quinolone-like structure, which is often found in compounds that inhibit enzymes like CYP2C19 and CYP2D6. These enzymes are involved in drug metabolism and can be associated with genes CYP2C19 and CYP2D6.
Step 3: The presence of a carboxamide group suggests potential interactions with ion channels, particularly those influenced by genes like KCNH2, which encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel.
Step 4: The overall structure does not directly suggest strong interactions with the listed genes related to tyrosine kinase activity (e.g., ABL1, LCK, KDR), receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g., FLT1), or growth factor receptors (e.g., HRH1).
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the most likely related genes are ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and KCNH2.
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, KCNH2.
