Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(CCNc2cc(N3CC[NH+](C(=O)c4ccccc4F)CC3)ccc2[N+](=O)[O-])cc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with a central nitrogen atom bearing a cyano group (CN), which is characteristic of molecules that may interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. These enzymes are involved in the metabolism of various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a pyrrolidine ring, which is known to interact with receptors such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This feature could be relevant to genes like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which encode dopamine receptors.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a quinoline moiety (quinoline is part of the larger molecule structure) is notable, as it can interact with several drug targets, including enzymes and receptors. This might relate to genes such as CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs.
Step 4: The molecule also has a benzofuran structure, which can bind to various receptors and ion channels. This could be relevant to genes like HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which encode serotonin receptors.
Step 5: The overall structure and functional groups of the molecule suggest potential interactions with multiple genes involved in drug metabolism and receptor signaling, including CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C.
