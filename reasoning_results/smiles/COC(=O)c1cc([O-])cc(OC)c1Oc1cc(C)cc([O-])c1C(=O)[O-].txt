Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COC(=O)c1cc([O-])cc(OC)c1Oc1cc(C)cc([O-])c1C(=O)[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that includes functional groups such as esters, amides, and hydroxyl groups. The presence of these functional groups suggests the molecule could interact with proteins involved in signaling pathways, transport, or metabolism.
Step 2: The molecule contains an amide group (C(=O)N) and an ester group (C(=O)O), which are common in drugs that target enzymes like CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. These enzymes are part of the cytochrome P450 family and are involved in the metabolism of many drugs.
Step 3: The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) indicates potential interactions with receptors or enzymes that bind to or metabolize compounds with similar structures. This could relate to genes encoding for receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmission, such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and SLC6A4.
Step 4: The molecule's structure also suggests it might have affinity for ion channels or other membrane proteins, given its overall size and complexity. This could potentially interact with genes like KCNH2, which encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel.
Step 5: Considering the above structural features, the molecule may be related to several genes including CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, HTR2A, HTR2B, SLC6A4, and KCNH2.
Summary of Related Gene Names:
- CYP2D6
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- SLC6A4
- KCNH2 Step 5: Based on the detailed analysis of the molecule's structure and its potential interactions with various biological processes, the related genes include those involved in drug metabolism (CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19), neurotransmission (HTR2A, HTR2B, SLC6A4), and ion channel function (KCNH2). These genes play crucial roles in the body's response to the molecule. The final list of related genes is as follows:
- KCNH2
These genes are the most likely candidates for further investigation regarding the potential effects of the molecule.
