Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(N2CC[NH+](C(CNC(=O)C3CCCCC3)c3cccnc3)CC2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that includes a number of functional groups such as amide, imine, and aromatic rings. This structure suggests the molecule could have pharmacological activity, potentially interacting with proteins involved in cellular signaling pathways.
Step 2: Given the presence of an amide group (-CONH-), it's possible this molecule could interact with receptors or enzymes that have amine or carboxylic acid functionalities. This is relevant for genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes involved in metabolism.
Step 3: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom that could form hydrogen bonds, which is significant for interactions with proteins that have hydrophilic pockets, such as those found in receptor binding sites. This is particularly relevant for genes encoding receptors like adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4).
Step 4: The presence of a benzene ring and a quaternary ammonium salt (-N+(C(CNC(=O)C3CCCCC3)c3cccnc3)) indicates potential for interactions with ion channels or transporters. This is relevant for genes like KCNH2 (potassium channel subfamily H member 2) and SLC6A4 (solute carrier family 6 member 4).
Step 5: Based on the structure and functional groups, the molecule might be related to genes involved in neurotransmitter systems and signaling pathways, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, and SLC6A4.

The other genes listed do not appear to have a direct structural or functional relationship with the given molecule based on its SMILES representation. However, this analysis is limited to the provided structural information, and more detailed biological assays would be needed to confirm any actual interaction. 
Note: The provided SMILES string is quite long and complex, making it difficult to definitively predict all possible interactions without further chemical and biological testing. The focus here is on the most likely candidates based on the structural features present.
