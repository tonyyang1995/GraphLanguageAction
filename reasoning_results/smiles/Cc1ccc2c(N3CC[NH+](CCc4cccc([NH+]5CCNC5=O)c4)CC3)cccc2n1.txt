Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc2c(N3CC[NH+](CCc4cccc([NH+]5CCNC5=O)c4)CC3)cccc2n1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with multiple functional groups including aromatic rings, amine functionalities, and a nitro group. The presence of an amine group and a nitro group suggests potential for interactions with proteins that have binding sites for such functional groups.
Step 2: The molecule contains a quinolone-like structure, which is known to interact with certain enzymes involved in drug metabolism. Specifically, molecules with this structure are often substrates or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are listed among the provided genes.
Step 3: The presence of a nitro group could also indicate interaction with enzymes involved in nitroreductase activity, potentially linking the molecule to CYP1A2, another gene from the provided list.
Step 4: Given the overall structure and functional groups, the molecule may also interact with receptors and transporters. For example, the amine group might allow for interaction with adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) or muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 5: The detailed interaction of the molecule would likely involve multiple targets due to its complexity, but the primary related genes based on structural features include: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP1A2
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- ADRB2
- CHRM1
- CHRM3
- CHRM4 Step 5: Summary of related gene names: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4. These genes are related to the molecule based on its structural features and potential interactions.
