Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])COc1ccccc1C(N=c1cccc[n-]1)c1cc(Cl)c2cccnc2c1[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has several key structural features including an amide (C=O), a carboxylate group (-COO-), and a pyrrole ring system. The presence of a carboxylate group suggests potential interactions with proteins that have acidic or basic residues, such as ion channels or receptors.
Step 2: The molecule also contains a quinoline-like structure (quinoline is part of the benzene ring system) and a pyrrolidine ring, which are common in ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This indicates potential interaction with GPCRs.
Step 3: The molecule's overall structure, with its various functional groups and aromatic rings, suggests it could interact with enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYPs), given their role in metabolizing drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 4: Given the presence of a quinoline moiety, the molecule may have affinity for receptors that are known to interact with quinoline derivatives, such as the serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Step 5: The molecule’s structure also hints at potential interactions with GPCRs, particularly those involved in neurotransmission and neuromodulation, such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are dopamine receptors, and HRH1, which is a histamine receptor.
Summary of Related Gene Names:
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- DRD2, DRD3, DRD4
- HRH1
These genes encode receptors and enzymes that might interact with the described molecule based on its chemical structure. The interactions could be direct binding or modulatory effects. Further testing would be required to confirm these predictions.
