Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc([NH+]2C(=O)NC(NC(=O)c3ccncc3)(C(F)(F)F)C2=O)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with a central benzene ring (COc1ccc), which is connected to a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic system (c([NH+]2C(=O)NC(NC(=O)c3ccncc3)(C(F)(F)F)C2=O)). This structure suggests that it could be a drug-like molecule designed to interact with specific receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a benzodiazepine-like ring system (c([NH+]2C(=O)NC(NC(=O)c3ccncc3)(C(F)(F)F)C2=O)) indicates that this molecule might interact with GABA-A receptors, which are associated with the gene CNR1 (Cannabinoid receptor 1). This interaction could modulate the effects of endocannabinoids and potentially influence neurotransmission.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a quinoline-like moiety (COc1ccc), which is known to interact with certain enzyme systems such as cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP enzymes). Specifically, CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 are involved in the metabolism of many drugs, including those with a similar structure to this molecule. These enzymes play a crucial role in drug metabolism and can affect the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of the drug.
Step 4: Given the presence of aromatic rings and functional groups such as amides and esters, the molecule could potentially interact with adrenergic receptors (e.g., ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and dopamine receptors (e.g., DRD2, DRD3, DRD4). These interactions might influence the regulation of neurotransmitters and could have therapeutic effects on conditions such as anxiety, depression, or pain.
Step 5: The molecule's structure also suggests potential interactions with estrogen receptors (e.g., ESR1), which are involved in various physiological processes, including hormone-dependent cancers. Additionally, the presence of fluorine atoms (C(F)(F)F) might indicate the molecule's ability to bind to certain ion channels (e.g., KCNH2) or other proteins involved in signal transduction pathways.
