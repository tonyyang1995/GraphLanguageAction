Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCOc1cc(N)ccc1C(=O)OCC[NH+](CC)CC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure that includes a benzene ring, an amide group, and an alcohol group. These structural features suggest the molecule could be a derivative of aminobenzodiazepine or a similar compound.
Step 2: Aminobenzodiazepines are known to interact with GABA receptors, particularly the GABAA receptor, which is associated with several genes such as GABRA1 (related to ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), GABRB1, and GABRG1. However, the given molecule does not have a direct structural match to these receptors but may still interact with them due to its benzene and amide functionalities.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a quinoline-like structure, which might indicate potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. These enzymes are involved in the metabolism of many drugs, including those affecting neurotransmitter systems.
Step 4: Given the presence of a quinoline-like structure, the molecule might also interact with the G protein-coupled receptor family, particularly those involved in neurotransmission and neuromodulation, such as HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and DRD2. These receptors are known to bind various ligands, including some that contain quinoline-like structures.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, and possibly GABRA1 (through its interaction with GABAA receptors).
