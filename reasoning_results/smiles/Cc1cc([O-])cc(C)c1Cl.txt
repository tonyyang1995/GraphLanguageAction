Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string Cc1cc([O-])cc(C)c1Cl is an organic compound containing a benzene ring, a negatively charged oxygen atom, and a chlorine substituent. This structure suggests the molecule could interact with proteins that have binding sites for negatively charged groups or aromatic rings.
Step 2: Considering the structure, the molecule likely has a pattern that includes a negatively charged group (-O-) which might be recognized by ion channels or receptors that bind to negatively charged ligands. This is relevant to genes such as KCNH2 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2), which encodes a cardiac potassium channel, and CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4 (cholinergic receptors) which are involved in neurotransmission and muscle function.
Step 3: The presence of a benzene ring in the molecule may indicate potential interactions with proteins that have hydrophobic binding sites, like G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Genes encoding GPCRs include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, all of which are involved in various physiological processes including neurotransmission and signal transduction.
Step 4: Given the chlorine substituent, the molecule could also potentially interact with enzymes that metabolize drugs or xenobiotics, such as those encoded by CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are part of the cytochrome P450 family.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes include: KCNH2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.
