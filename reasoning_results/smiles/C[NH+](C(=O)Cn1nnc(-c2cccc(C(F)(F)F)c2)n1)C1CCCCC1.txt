Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+](C(=O)Cn1nnc(-c2cccc(C(F)(F)F)c2)n1)C1CCCCC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with multiple functional groups including an amide (C=O), amines (NH+), and aromatic rings. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for similar functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of an amine group (NH+) and aromatic rings indicates possible interactions with receptors and transporters that typically bind to such structures. For example, some receptors like G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have binding sites for small molecules with similar functional groups.
Step 3: Given the pattern of the molecule, it could potentially interact with genes encoding for GPCRs such as DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes encode for various subtypes of serotonin receptors, which are known to bind to small molecules and play crucial roles in neurotransmission.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule might also interact with genes involved in signal transduction pathways, such as KDR (encoding VEGF receptor) due to its aromatic structure, which can be relevant for tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related gene names are: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and KDR.
Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- HTR6
- KDR Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related gene names are: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and KDR. Summary of related gene names: - DRD2 - HTR1A - HTR2A - HTR2B - HTR2C - HTR6 - KDR
This summary lists the genes that are likely to have a relationship with the given molecule based on its chemical structure and potential binding sites.
