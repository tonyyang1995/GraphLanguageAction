Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Cc1ccccc1)Nc1ccc2oc(-c3ccncc3)nc2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that includes a benzene ring (Cc1ccccc1), an amide group (-C=O), and several nitrogen-containing functional groups including a pyrrole ring (Nc1ccc2oc(-c3ccncc3)nc2c1). This structure suggests the molecule could have interactions with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways or transport mechanisms.
Step 2: Analyzing the genes provided, we find that several are involved in neurotransmitter receptors and signaling pathways, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4. These genes encode for receptors that bind to various neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and acetylcholine.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule contains a pyrrole ring and amide functionality, which are common in drugs targeting G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other receptor types. This structural feature aligns well with the presence of GPCR-related genes in the list.
Step 4: Furthermore, the molecule’s amide and aromatic functionalities suggest potential interaction with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize many drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule appears to be potentially related to the following genes: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4.
