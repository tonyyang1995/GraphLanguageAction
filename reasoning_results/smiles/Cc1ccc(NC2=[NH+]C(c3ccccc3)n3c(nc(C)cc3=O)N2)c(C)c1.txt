Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(NC2=[NH+]C(c3ccccc3)n3c(nc(C)cc3=O)N2)c(C)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples or additional text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom that forms part of a heterocyclic ring system, specifically an imidazole ring, which is connected to a pyrrolidine ring via a carbon atom. This pattern suggests potential interactions with enzymes or receptors that contain similar functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom double-bonded to a carbon (NC2=[NH+]) indicates a positively charged amine group, which could interact with acidic residues or negatively charged regions of proteins, such as those found in ion channels or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The molecule also includes a carboxylate group (-COOH), which is known to form hydrogen bonds and can interact with basic amino acid residues, potentially affecting protein stability or function.
Step 4: Given the molecular structure, it may interact with genes encoding proteins that have binding sites for small molecules with similar functional groups, such as ion channels (e.g., KCNH2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) and enzymes involved in drug metabolism (e.g., CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Step 5: The molecule's structure might also interact with genes involved in neurotransmitter systems (e.g., DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) due to its potential to bind to receptors or modulate their activity through interactions with their ligand-binding domains.
Summary of related gene names: KCNH2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
