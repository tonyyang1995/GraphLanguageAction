Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cn1c(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)cc2sccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups including a carboxamide group (-CONH), a benzene ring with substitutions (including a nitro group -NO2), and a sulfone group (-SO2). These structural features suggest that the molecule could interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group indicates that the molecule may be an inhibitor or substrate for enzymes involved in the metabolism of drugs containing similar functional groups. This includes enzymes such as CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize a wide range of drugs.
Step 3: The benzene ring with a nitro group and a sulfone group suggests that the molecule could also interact with ion channels or receptors. For instance, the nitro group could potentially modulate the activity of voltage-gated sodium channels, which are encoded by genes like SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN3A, SCN4A, and SCN5A. However, since these specific genes are not listed, we will focus on the genes provided in the list.
Step 4: Given the potential interactions with metabolic enzymes and the presence of functional groups that could influence receptor binding, the molecule might have effects on neurotransmitter systems. Genes like HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 encode serotonin receptors, which could be affected by the molecule due to its structural characteristics.
Step 5: Considering the above points, the molecule may be related to several genes involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmission. The related gene names are:
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- HTR6
These genes are involved in processes that could be influenced by the molecule's structure and potential biological activities.
