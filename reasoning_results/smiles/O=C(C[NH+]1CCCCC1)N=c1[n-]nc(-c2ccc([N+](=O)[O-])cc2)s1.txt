Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(C[NH+]1CCCCC1)N=c1[n-]nc(-c2ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc2)s1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a nitrile group (-CN) and a quaternary ammonium group ([NH+]4). This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for aromatic compounds or positively charged groups.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) and a quaternary ammonium group may indicate the molecule has electrophilic and basic properties, which could influence its interaction with enzymes involved in metabolism and signaling pathways.
Step 3: The quaternary ammonium group and the nitrile group suggest the molecule might be able to form hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions, which are important for binding to receptors and ion channels.
Step 4: Considering the pattern of the molecule and its functional groups, it is likely to interact with proteins such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), ion channels, and enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 5: Based on the described structure and potential interactions, the molecule could be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
