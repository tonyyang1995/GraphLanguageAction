Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc2[nH]c3nc(SCc4nnc(-c5ccc(C)cc5)o4)nnc3c2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains multiple rings, including a benzene ring, a pyrrole ring, and a pyridine ring, which are characteristic of many drug-like molecules. This suggests that the molecule might interact with receptors or enzymes that contain similar structural motifs.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-CONH-) and a substituted phenol (phenolic hydroxyl group) in the molecule indicates potential interactions with proteins that have amine binding sites or require activation through phosphorylation/dephosphorylation processes. These functional groups are common in molecules that modulate the activity of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and kinases, which are encoded by several of the listed genes.
Step 3: The nitrogen atoms in the molecule, particularly those involved in heterocycles like pyrrole and pyridine, suggest the possibility of the molecule interacting with proteins that have binding sites for basic amino acids or that are involved in signaling pathways where such nitrogen-containing moieties play a role.
Step 4: Given the complexity and the presence of functional groups that could interact with various protein targets, the molecule could potentially influence the function of several genes involved in neurotransmitter systems, receptor signaling, and enzyme activities. For instance, it could interact with GPCRs encoded by genes like DRD2, DRD3, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are known to be involved in neurotransmission and mood regulation.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule’s structure might also interact with genes encoding enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are part of the cytochrome P450 family and play crucial roles in the biotransformation of xenobiotics.
Summary of related genes: DRD2, DRD3, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4.
