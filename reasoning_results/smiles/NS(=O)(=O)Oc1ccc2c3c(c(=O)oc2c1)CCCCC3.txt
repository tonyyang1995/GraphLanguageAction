Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NS(=O)(=O)Oc1ccc2c3c(c(=O)oc2c1)CCCCC3, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a structure that includes a nitrogen atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom (N=O), which is part of a larger system of functional groups such as esters (-COO) and a benzene ring. This pattern suggests the molecule may interact with enzymes or receptors that are involved in metabolic pathways or neurotransmission.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and the ester group (-COO) indicates this molecule could potentially be an inhibitor or substrate for enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP (cytochrome P450) family genes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These enzymes play crucial roles in metabolizing various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: Given the structural features, particularly the ester linkage and the potential for interaction with receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmission, this molecule might also interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Genes encoding GPCRs include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are all involved in regulating various physiological processes including mood, pain, and inflammation.
Step 4: The molecule's structure might also suggest interactions with ion channels, given the presence of a benzene ring, which could be relevant to KCNH2 (a voltage-gated potassium channel) and PTGS1 (which encodes COX-1, an enzyme involved in prostaglandin synthesis).
Step 5: Considering the above points, the molecule is likely to have a relationship with several genes involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6) and neurotransmission (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, PTGS1).
