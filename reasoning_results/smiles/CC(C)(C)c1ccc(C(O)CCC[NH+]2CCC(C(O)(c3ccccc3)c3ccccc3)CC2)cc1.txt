Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)(C)c1ccc(C(O)CCC[NH+]2CCC(C(O)(c3ccccc3)c3ccccc3)CC2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with various functional groups attached, including an amide group and a quaternary ammonium group. These features suggest potential interactions with receptors that have similar chemical functionalities.
Step 2: The presence of a quaternary ammonium group indicates possible interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 3: The amide group could also interact with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known for their role in drug metabolism.
Step 4: The overall structure does not strongly suggest direct interaction with other genes listed, such as those related to kinases (LCK, KDR) or signaling pathways (PTGS1, HRH1).
Step 5: Based on the molecular features, the most likely related genes are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6.
