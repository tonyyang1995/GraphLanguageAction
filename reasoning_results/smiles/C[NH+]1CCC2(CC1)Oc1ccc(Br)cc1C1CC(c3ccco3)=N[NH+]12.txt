Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+]1CCC2(CC1)Oc1ccc(Br)cc1C1CC(c3ccco3)=N[NH+]12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains several functional groups including an amide group (-NHCO-), a benzene ring (phenyl), a nitro group (-NO2), and a bromine atom (Br). These features suggest the molecule may interact with proteins that have binding sites for aromatic compounds, amides, or nitrogen-containing heterocycles.
Step 2: Considering the presence of a nitro group and a bromine atom, the molecule likely interacts with enzymes or receptors that recognize such substituents. This could include cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP family), which metabolize drugs containing aromatic rings and nitro groups.
Step 3: The presence of a benzene ring and a nitro group also suggests potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that bind to ligands with similar chemical structures. GPCRs like adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4) could be relevant due to their ability to bind to aromatic and nitrogen-containing molecules.
Step 4: Given the nitro group and the potential for drug metabolism, the molecule might influence enzymes involved in xenobiotic metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are part of the cytochrome P450 superfamily.
Step 5: The molecule’s structure, particularly its aromatic and nitrogen-containing features, could also interact with ion channels and transporters. For example, it might affect voltage-gated calcium channels (CACNA1H) or neurotransmitter transporters like serotonin (HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C).
