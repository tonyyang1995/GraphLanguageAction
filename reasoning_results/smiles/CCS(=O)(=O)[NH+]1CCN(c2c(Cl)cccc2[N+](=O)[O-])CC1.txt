Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCS(=O)(=O)[NH+]1CCN(c2c(Cl)cccc2[N+](=O)[O-])CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule is a complex compound that includes a core structure with a benzene ring (CC), a carboxylic acid group (O), and an amide linkage (=O)(=O). This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes and receptors involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylic acid and amide groups indicates the molecule could be an inhibitor or substrate for enzymes such as CYPs (cytochrome P450) and monoamine oxidases, which are involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmitter degradation. These enzymes are encoded by genes like CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.
Step 3: The aromatic ring and basic amine group (NH+) suggest the molecule might interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly those involved in neurotransmission. GPCRs are encoded by genes like DRD2, DRD3, and HTR2A.
Step 4: The molecule's structure also hints at possible interactions with voltage-gated ion channels, given the presence of a benzene ring and amide groups. Voltage-gated ion channels are encoded by genes such as KCNH2.
Step 5: Considering the potential interactions with enzymes and receptors, the related genes include: CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, HTR2A, and KCNH2.
