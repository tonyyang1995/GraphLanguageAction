Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [NH3+]C1CC1c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this information might be useful.
Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string [NH3+]C1CC1c1ccccc1 is a positively charged amine derivative of benzene with multiple aromatic rings. This structural feature suggests potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for small molecules or ions, particularly those involved in neurotransmission or signal transduction.
Step 2: Analyzing the genes listed, several are associated with neurotransmitter receptors and signaling pathways. For example, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C are all involved in the regulation of serotonin signaling, which could potentially interact with the positively charged amine group of the molecule. Similarly, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4 are muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, which may also bind to the molecule due to its basic nature.
Step 3: The molecule’s aromatic structure and positive charge might also interact with enzymes such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are involved in the metabolism of various drugs and xenobiotics. These enzymes typically recognize and modify hydrophobic substrates, and the aromatic rings of the molecule could be suitable for binding.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule could interact with ion channels like KCNH2, which is a member of the voltage-gated potassium channel family. The positively charged amine group might interact with the selectivity filter of these channels, affecting their function.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the genes related to the molecule include: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and KCNH2. These genes encode proteins that could potentially interact with the molecule due to its chemical structure and charge. 
Summary of related genes: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, KCNH2.
