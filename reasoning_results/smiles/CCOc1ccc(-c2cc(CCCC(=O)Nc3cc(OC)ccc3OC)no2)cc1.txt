Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOc1ccc(-c2cc(CCCC(=O)Nc3cc(OC)ccc3OC)no2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure including a benzene ring system, a carbonyl group, and an amide moiety. This suggests potential interactions with enzymes or receptors that have similar functional groups.
Step 2: Among the given genes, those involved in drug metabolism such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 could potentially interact with this molecule due to its functional groups. These enzymes are known to metabolize drugs containing aromatic rings, carbonyls, and amides.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of an amide and a benzene ring in the molecule may suggest a possible interaction with receptors like DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), which often binds to ligands with aromatic structures.
Step 4: The molecule’s structure also hints at potential binding to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to the presence of an amine group, which could be a ligand for receptors such as HTR2A (Serotonin receptor 2A).
Step 5: Based on the molecule’s structural features, the related genes are: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, and HTR2A.
