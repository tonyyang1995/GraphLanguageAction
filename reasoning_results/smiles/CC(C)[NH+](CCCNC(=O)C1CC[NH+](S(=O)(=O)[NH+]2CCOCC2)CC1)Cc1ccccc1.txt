Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)[NH+](CCCNC(=O)C1CC[NH+](S(=O)(=O)[NH+]2CCOCC2)CC1)Cc1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound with multiple functional groups including amine, carbonyl, and ester functionalities. It contains aromatic rings and several carbon chains, suggesting it could be a drug-like molecule designed to interact with receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: Upon closer inspection, the molecule includes a pyrrolidine ring system, which is a common pharmacophore for interacting with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature is particularly relevant to the genes encoding various types of GPCRs, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, all of which are involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways.
Step 3: The presence of an amide group and an ester group in the molecule suggests potential interactions with enzymes that metabolize drugs, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are part of the cytochrome P450 family. These enzymes play a crucial role in the biotransformation of many drugs, making them relevant to the metabolism and efficacy of the molecule.
Step 4: The molecule also contains a benzene ring system, which could interact with transporters like SLC6A2 and SLC6A4, known to be involved in the uptake and reuptake of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and norepinephrine.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule appears to be related to the genes encoding GPCRs, enzymes involved in drug metabolism, and transporters. Therefore, the related gene names include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, SLC6A2, SLC6A4. 
Summary of related gene names:
- ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2
- CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4
- DRD2, DRD3, DRD4
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6
- SLC6A2, SLC6A4
These genes are primarily involved in neurotransmission, drug metabolism, and transporter functions.
