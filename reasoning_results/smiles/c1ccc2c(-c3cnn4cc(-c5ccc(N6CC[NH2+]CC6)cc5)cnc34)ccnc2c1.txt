Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule likely involved in biological processes such as signal transduction or enzymatic activity. The molecule contains several aromatic rings, including benzene rings and heterocycles like pyrroles and pyridines. It also includes nitrogen-containing groups, which are often involved in forming hydrogen bonds and interacting with proteins.
Step 2: The presence of multiple nitrogen atoms and potential amine functionalities suggests that this molecule could interact with receptors or enzymes containing similar functional groups. For instance, it might bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds and stabilize the receptor structure through hydrophobic interactions.
Step 3: Among the listed genes, several are known to encode GPCRs. These include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. The molecule's structure aligns well with the binding sites of these receptors, suggesting potential interactions.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule may interact with enzymes encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are part of the cytochrome P450 family involved in drug metabolism. The presence of multiple functional groups, especially those containing oxygen and nitrogen, is consistent with substrates for these enzymes.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis and the nature of the molecule, the related genes are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes encode receptors and enzymes that are potential targets for the described molecule.
