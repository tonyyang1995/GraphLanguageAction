Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccccc1CSCCNC(=O)CCSc1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound containing aromatic rings (cyclohexane-like structures), sulfur atoms, and a carboxamide group (-CONH2). This structure suggests it could interact with proteins involved in signaling pathways or transport functions.
Step 2: Looking at the genes listed, several are associated with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These receptors typically bind small molecules and activate intracellular signaling cascades.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule contains a carboxamide group, which could potentially interact with enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 that are involved in drug metabolism. These enzymes catalyze reactions involving hydroxylation and oxidation of substrates, often including drugs.
Step 4: The presence of a cyclic structure and sulfur atom might suggest interactions with ion channels, such as KCNH2, which encodes for a voltage-gated potassium channel. However, this is less likely given the primary focus on GPCRs and metabolic enzymes in the provided list.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the molecule is most likely to be related to GPCRs (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) and enzymes involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6). These relationships stem from the molecular structure's potential to bind and modulate these protein types.
