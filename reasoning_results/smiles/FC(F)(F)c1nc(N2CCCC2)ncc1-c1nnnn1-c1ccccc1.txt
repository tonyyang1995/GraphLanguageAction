Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: FC(F)(F)c1nc(N2CCCC2)ncc1-c1nnnn1-c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains multiple fluorine atoms (F) and nitro groups (-NO2), indicating potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism and drug transport.
Step 2: The presence of aromatic rings and heterocycles suggests the molecule may interact with receptors and ion channels, particularly those involved in neurotransmission.
Step 3: The molecule's structure includes amide and ester functionalities, which are common in ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 4: The overall structure hints at potential binding to enzymes such as CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 due to its functional groups, which are known to be involved in drug metabolism.
Step 5: Given the structural features, the molecule could potentially interact with genes like CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, and DRD2, which encode enzymes and receptors involved in neurotransmission and metabolism.
Summary of related genes: CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, DRD2 Step 1: The molecule contains multiple fluorine atoms (F) and nitro groups (-NO2), indicating potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism and drug transport.
