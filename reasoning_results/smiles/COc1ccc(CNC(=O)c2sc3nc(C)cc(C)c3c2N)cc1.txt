Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(CNC(=O)c2sc3nc(C)cc(C)c3c2N)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring fused to a benzene ring, which is characteristic of many G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) antagonists and ligands. This structural feature is commonly found in molecules that interact with receptors like adrenergic and cholinergic receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) and an amide group (-CONH-) suggests the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors involved in signal transduction pathways. These functional groups are often found in molecules that target kinases, GPCRs, and other signaling proteins.
Step 3: The presence of a thiazole ring and a pyridine ring indicates the molecule might have affinity for receptors such as adrenergic and muscarinic receptors, which are known to contain these aromatic heterocycles in their structures.
Step 4: The overall structure and functional groups suggest the molecule could interact with multiple GPCRs, including adrenergic (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4) receptors, as well as other receptors like HRH1 (histamine H1 receptor).
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and potential interactions, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1.
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1.
