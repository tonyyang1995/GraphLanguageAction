Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1onc(-c2c(F)cccc2Cl)c1C(=O)OCC(=O)NCc1ccco1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples or additional text.
Step 1: The molecule contains multiple functional groups including amide, ester, and aromatic rings. These structural features suggest potential interactions with proteins involved in signal transduction and receptor binding.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and an amide group could indicate a possible interaction with receptors such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are known to bind small molecules containing similar functional groups.
Step 3: The molecule's ability to interact with GPCRs might be relevant to genes encoding for GPCRs like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, as these genes encode for receptors that bind various neurotransmitters and hormones.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure may allow it to interact with enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6. Step 5: Related Gene List: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6.
