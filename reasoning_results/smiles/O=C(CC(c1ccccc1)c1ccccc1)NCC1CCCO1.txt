Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(CC(c1ccccc1)c1ccccc1)NCC1CCCO1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with multiple substitutions, including a nitro group (-NO2), an amide group (-CONH-), and a methyl group (-CH3). This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a nitro group and amide group could indicate the molecule might interact with enzymes such as CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize drugs containing similar functional groups.
Step 3: The molecule also has a quinoline-like structure, which could suggest potential interactions with genes involved in G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or ion channels, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, and KCNH2.
Step 4: Given the presence of a nitrogen atom in the amide group, the molecule might also interact with genes encoding for neurotransmitter receptors, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 5: The summary of related genes includes: CYP2C19, CYP2D6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, KCNH2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
