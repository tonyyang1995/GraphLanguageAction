Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: OCC[NH+]1CC[NH+](CCCN2c3ccccc3C=Cc3ccccc32)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with a core structure that includes an amine group (NH+) attached to a benzene ring, which is also part of a larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) system. This core structure suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways and neurotransmitter systems due to its amine functionality and aromatic nature.
Step 2: The presence of multiple amine groups (NH+) in the molecule indicates it could be a ligand for various receptors, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are involved in numerous physiological processes including neurotransmission and hormone signaling, which aligns with several of the listed genes, particularly those related to receptor function.
Step 3: The aromatic ring system in the molecule might allow for interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP), which are listed among the provided genes. These enzymes play crucial roles in the biotransformation of xenobiotics and endogenous compounds.
Step 4: Given the presence of a benzene ring and amine functionalities, the molecule could potentially interact with ion channels and transporters, which are associated with genes like KCNH2 (a potassium channel) and SLC6A4 (a serotonin transporter). These interactions suggest possible modulation of ion fluxes and neurotransmitter uptake.
Step 5: Considering the potential for interaction with receptors, enzymes, and ion channels, the following genes are likely to have a relationship with the described molecule: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, KCNH2, SLC6A4. These genes encode proteins involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmission, and ion regulation, which are key biological processes that could be affected by the described molecule.
