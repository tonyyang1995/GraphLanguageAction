Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+](CC(=O)[NH+]1CCN(c2ccccn2)CC1)S(=O)(=O)c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains multiple functional groups including an amide (N-C=O), a sulfonate ester (SO3-), and a substituted benzene ring. These functional groups suggest the molecule could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction, transport, and metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of amide and benzene rings is indicative of potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are encoded by genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6. These receptors mediate responses to various neurotransmitters and hormones.
Step 3: The sulfonate ester group may indicate a pharmacophore that could interact with enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: The overall structure suggests possible interactions with kinases, such as LCK and PTGS1, due to their involvement in signal transduction pathways.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure, it is likely to have interactions with genes involved in neurotransmission and receptor signaling (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) and drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6).
