Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: c1ccc(-c2nnc(SCCC3OCCCO3)o2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a substituted nitrogen atom (N) connected to a sulfur-containing group (SCCC3OCCCO3). This pattern suggests potential interaction with proteins involved in neurotransmitter transport and receptor function.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and nitrogen substituent could indicate possible binding to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are often associated with genes such as DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 3: The sulfur-containing group (thioether) might interact with cysteine residues in proteins, which could be relevant to genes like KCNH2 and LCK, known for their roles in ion channel function and signaling pathways.
Step 4: Given the complex structure and potential for multiple interactions, the molecule may also influence enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 5: The overall structure hints at potential effects on ion channels and neurotransmitter systems, making it relevant to genes like CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CNR1, and PTGS1.
Summary of related genes: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, LCK, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CNR1, PTGS1.
