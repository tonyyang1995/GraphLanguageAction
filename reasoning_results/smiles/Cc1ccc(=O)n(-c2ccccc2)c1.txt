Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(=O)n(-c2ccccc2)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule is a tricyclic compound containing a pyrrole ring fused to a benzene ring, which is further connected to an imidazole ring via a methine bridge. This structure suggests potential interactions with receptors or enzymes that bind to aromatic or heterocyclic compounds.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (imidazole) and an amide group (-CONH-) indicates possible binding to receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmission or metabolism, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Step 3: The aromatic nature of the molecule could lead to interactions with genes encoding for proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, particularly those with GPCR ligand-binding domains or ion channel functions.
Step 4: Given the potential for interaction with GPCRs, the molecule may be related to genes such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode serotonin receptors, and CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4, which encode muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule might interact with genes like CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics due to the presence of functional groups that can be oxidized or reduced by these enzymes.
Summary of related genes: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C19, CYP2D6.
