Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C1OCc2cccc3cccc1c23, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule has a structure that includes a benzene ring with an oxygen atom attached (O=C1OCc2cccc3cccc1c23). This suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP genes.
Step 2: The presence of multiple aromatic rings and functional groups like oxygenated heterocycles indicates possible binding to receptors or ion channels. This could relate to genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels.
Step 3: The molecule's overall shape and functional groups may also interact with enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways, potentially linking it to genes like EGFR, HRH1, and PTGS1.
Step 4: Considering the molecule's structure, it might interact with neurotransmitter transporters, suggesting a connection to SLC6A2 and SLC6A4.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and potential interactions, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
