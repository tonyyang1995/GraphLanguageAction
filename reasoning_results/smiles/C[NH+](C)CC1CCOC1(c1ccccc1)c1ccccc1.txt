Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+](C)CC1CCOC1(c1ccccc1)c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups including an amine group (-NH+) that can form hydrogen bonds, a benzene ring which is aromatic and can participate in non-covalent interactions, and several hydrocarbon chains. The presence of a positively charged nitrogen suggests it could be an electrophilic species.
Step 2: Among the listed genes, those involved in neurotransmitter transport and metabolism are more likely to interact with such a molecule due to its potential to modulate receptor activity or enzyme function. Genes encoding receptors (like adrenergic and cholinergic receptors) and enzymes (like cytochromes P450) are particularly relevant.
Step 3: Specific genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and CYP2C19 encode receptors and enzymes that could directly interact with the molecule based on its chemical structure.
Step 4: The molecule's ability to form hydrogen bonds and engage in non-covalent interactions with proteins makes it plausible for it to bind to receptors or enzymes encoded by genes such as DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, and CYP3A4.
Step 5: Considering the detailed structural analysis and the known functions of the listed genes, the related genes are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C19, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, and CYP3A4. These genes encode receptors and enzymes that could potentially interact with the given molecule.
