Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: OC(CC1c2ccccc2-c2cncn21)C1CCCCC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule given has a complex structure with multiple rings and functional groups, including an aromatic ring system, a pyrrole ring, and a benzene ring. This complexity suggests that the molecule may interact with various biological targets, potentially including enzymes and receptors.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of a pyrrole ring and a benzene ring in the molecule indicates potential interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs), such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These enzymes are known to metabolize a wide range of drugs and xenobiotics, and their activity can be influenced by structural features similar to those found in this molecule.
Step 3: Additionally, the aromatic nature of the molecule might allow for binding to ion channels or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Specifically, the structure could interact with adrenergic receptors like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, and adenosine receptors such as CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4. Furthermore, the presence of a benzene ring and other substituents could also suggest potential interaction with voltage-gated potassium channels like KCNH2.
Step 4: The molecule's overall structure and functional groups might also influence its ability to modulate neurotransmitter receptors. For example, it could interact with dopamine receptors such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, as well as serotonin receptors like HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis and the potential interactions described above, the related genes can be summarized as follows: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2. These genes encode proteins that could directly or indirectly interact with the given molecule, influencing its pharmacological profile and metabolism.
