Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(COc1ccc(Cl)cc1)NCCSCc1cccc(Cl)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that includes functional groups such as carbonyl (C=O), amide (N-C=O), ester (O-C-O), aromatic rings (c1...c1), and chlorine substituents (Cl). This molecular structure suggests it could interact with proteins involved in various biological processes, including receptor binding and enzymatic activity.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (N-C=O) and ester groups (O-C-O) indicates potential interactions with enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYP enzymes), which are known to metabolize drugs and xenobiotics. CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are particularly relevant due to their roles in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The aromatic rings and chlorine substituents suggest potential interactions with receptors that have similar chemical features. For instance, adrenergic receptors (such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (such as CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4) often bind to molecules with aromatic structures and electronegative substituents.
Step 4: Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, the molecule might also interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and HRH1, which are known to bind ligands with diverse structures.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HRH1. These genes encode proteins that are involved in drug metabolism and receptor signaling pathways. 
Summary of Related Genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HRH1.
