Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC[NH+](CC)CCn1c(=NCc2nc3ccccc3n2Cc2ccccc2)[n-]c2ccccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple rings and functional groups, including amine (NH+), benzene (C6H5), and aromatic nitro (-NO2) functionalities. These structural features suggest potential interactions with receptors or enzymes that have binding sites for similar chemical moieties.
Step 2: Considering the presence of an amine group (NH+) and the overall molecular complexity, this compound could interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are known to bind small molecules and ions, which aligns with the amine and aromatic components of the molecule.
Step 3: Several of the listed genes encode for GPCRs: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. The amine group in the molecule might allow it to act as a partial agonist or antagonist for these receptors, depending on its exact structure and affinity.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of aromatic rings and possible nitro groups could indicate potential interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These enzymes metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics, and their activity can be influenced by structural analogues like the given molecule.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the related genes are likely to be those encoding GPCRs (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) and enzymes involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6).
Summary of related gene names:
- GPCRs: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- Metabolism: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6
Please note that this analysis is based on the structural features of the molecule and does not definitively establish biological interactions or effects. Experimental validation would be necessary to confirm any actual biological relevance.
