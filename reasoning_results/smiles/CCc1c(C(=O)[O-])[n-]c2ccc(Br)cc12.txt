Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCc1c(C(=O)[O-])[n-]c2ccc(Br)cc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string CCc1c(C(=O)[O-])[n-]c2ccc(Br)cc12 has several structural features that are notable. It contains a benzene ring (indicated by "c1c"), a carboxylate group (-COOH), an amine group (-NH2), and a bromine atom (-Br). The presence of these functional groups suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in transport, receptor binding, or enzymatic activity.
Step 2: The carboxylate group (-COOH) could potentially interact with proteins that have negatively charged binding sites, such as ion channels or receptors. This feature might be relevant for genes encoding ion channels like KCNH2, which encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel, or receptors like HTR2A, which encodes a serotonin receptor.
Step 3: The amine group (-NH2) in the molecule could also interact with proteins that have positively charged binding sites, such as receptors or transporters. This feature might be relevant for genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, or adrenergic receptors like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2.
Step 4: The bromine atom (-Br) in the molecule could affect its pharmacological properties by altering its lipophilicity, which could influence its interaction with membrane-bound proteins or enzymes. This feature might be relevant for genes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4.
Step 5: Based on the structural features of the molecule, the related genes could include those involved in ion channel function (e.g., KCNH2), GPCR signaling (e.g., CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), and drug metabolism (e.g., CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Summary of related gene names:
- KCNH2
- CHRM1
- CHRM3
- CHRM4
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- ADRB2
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
