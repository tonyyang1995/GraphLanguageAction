Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N#Cc1ccc(C(c2ccc(C#N)cc2)n2cncn2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a core structure that includes a nitrogen atom triple-bonded to a carbon (N#C), which is a common feature in many bioactive molecules, including some ligands for receptors involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The molecule also contains multiple aromatic rings and heteroatoms such as nitrogen and oxygen, which are often found in ligands that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are a large family of membrane proteins that play key roles in cellular signaling processes and are associated with various physiological functions and diseases.
Step 3: Among the listed genes, several are known to encode GPCRs, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes are responsible for encoding receptors that respond to various neurotransmitters and hormones.
Step 4: The presence of a nitrogen atom triple-bonded to a carbon and the overall structure of the molecule suggest it may be capable of binding to GPCRs, potentially modulating their activity. This interaction could affect the signaling pathways mediated by these receptors, leading to changes in cellular function.
Step 5: Based on the structural characteristics of the molecule and its potential interaction with GPCRs, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes encode receptors that could be targeted by the molecule, influencing various physiological processes through their respective signaling pathways. 
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
