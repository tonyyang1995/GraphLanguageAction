Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)C1CCC[NH+](C(=O)C2c3ccccc3Oc3ccccc32)C1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound with multiple functional groups including an amide group (N-C=O), an ester group (O-C=O), and aromatic rings. The presence of these groups suggests that the molecule could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction and metabolism.
Step 2: The aromatic ring system in the molecule, specifically the benzene ring with attached substituents, is reminiscent of the ligand-binding domains of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are known to be regulated by various drugs and can be associated with several of the listed genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
Step 3: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an amide group in the molecule indicates it might act as an inhibitor or substrate for enzymes involved in metabolism. This feature aligns with the role of some of the listed genes in drug metabolism pathways, particularly CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule, with its potential for binding to receptors and enzymes, suggests that it may influence signaling pathways involving second messengers or ion channels. This could relate to the functions of genes like KCNH2, which codes for a voltage-gated potassium channel, and PTGS1, which encodes cyclooxygenase-1, an enzyme involved in prostaglandin synthesis.
Step 5: Considering the interactions and potential binding sites of the molecule, it is likely to have effects on genes involved in neurotransmitter systems and hormone signaling. This includes genes such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, ESR1 (estrogen receptor), and PTGS1 (cyclooxygenase).
Summary of related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, KCNH2, PTGS1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, ESR1, PTGS1.
