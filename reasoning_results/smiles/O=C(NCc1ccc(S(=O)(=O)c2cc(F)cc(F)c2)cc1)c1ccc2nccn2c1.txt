Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(NCc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)c2cc(F)cc(F)c2)cc1)c1ccc2nccn2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple functional groups such as a ketone (C=O), a nitrogen atom (N), and several aromatic rings. These features suggest that the molecule could be a ligand or inhibitor targeting receptors or enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: Upon examining the structure, there is a sulphonated group (-SO3-) attached to an aromatic ring, which is characteristic of drugs like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This indicates potential interactions with enzymes or receptors that are known to be inhibited by NSAIDs, such as cyclooxygenases (COX).
Step 3: The presence of a nitrile group (-CN) and a quaternary ammonium salt suggests the molecule might interact with ion channels or transporters. For example, the quaternary ammonium part could interact with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), while the nitrile could affect voltage-gated sodium channels.
Step 4: Given the above structural features, the molecule may interact with genes encoding for enzymes involved in drug metabolism (e.g., CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) or receptors that could be affected by NSAIDs or ion channel modulators (e.g., HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, KCNH2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, KCNH2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4. 
Note: The remaining genes listed do not have a clear direct relationship with the molecular structure described, so they are not included in the summary. However, some of these genes may be indirectly related if the molecule affects their expression or function through signaling pathways. Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, KCNH2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4. 
Note: The remaining genes listed do not have a clear direct relationship with the molecular structure described, so they are not included in the summary. However, some of these genes may be indirectly related if the molecule affects their expression or function through signaling pathways.
