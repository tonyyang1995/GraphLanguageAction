Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Nc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound containing a nitrogen atom (N), a benzene ring with a chlorine substituent, another benzene ring with an oxygen substituent, and a cyclohexane ring. This structure indicates that the molecule is likely a derivative of a benzodiazepine or a similar heterocyclic compound.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring with a chlorine substituent suggests that the molecule could potentially interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: The oxygen-containing functional group (-OH) in the molecule might allow for interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Specifically, it could interact with dopamine receptors (e.g., DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) and serotonin receptors (e.g., HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Step 4: Given the structure of the molecule, it may also interact with ion channels. For example, it could bind to potassium channels like KCNH2 or calcium channels like CACNA1H.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and potential interactions described, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, CACNA1H. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound containing a nitrogen atom (N), a benzene ring with a chlorine substituent, another benzene ring with an oxygen substituent, and a cyclohexane ring. This structure indicates that the molecule is likely a derivative of a benzodiazepine or a similar heterocyclic compound.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and potential interactions described, the related genes include: **CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C
