Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CS(=O)(=O)Nc1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc1OC1CCCCC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule with a core structure that includes a carboxylic acid (COOH), an amide group (CON), and a pyrrolidine ring. The presence of a carboxylic acid suggests this molecule could be an inhibitor or substrate for enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP enzymes.
Step 2: The molecule also contains a pyrrolidine ring, which is a common structural motif found in many drugs that interact with receptors. Specifically, the pyrrolidine ring is known to bind to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are involved in various signaling pathways and are encoded by genes like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4. These genes encode dopamine receptors, which are crucial for neurotransmission and can be targeted by compounds with similar structures.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of an amide group (CON) and a carboxylic acid (COOH) in the molecule suggests it could interact with ion channels. For example, the KCNH2 gene encodes the hERG potassium channel, which is known to be affected by certain drugs due to its role in cardiac repolarization.
Step 4: Given the complexity of the molecule, it is likely to have multiple binding sites, making it potentially relevant to several genes. However, based on the specific structural features mentioned, the most probable genes it might interact with are those encoding GPCRs and ion channels.
Step 5: Therefore, the genes most likely to be related to this molecule are: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, KCNH2.
Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2
- DRD3
- DRD4
- KCNH2
