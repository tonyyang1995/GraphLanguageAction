Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(NC(=O)c2cc(N3C(=O)C=CC3=O)ccc2Cl)cc1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this relationship might be significant.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom within a ring system, which suggests it may interact with proteins that have binding sites for heterocyclic compounds containing nitrogen. This structural feature could potentially relate to the molecule's interaction with neurotransmitter receptors, such as those encoded by genes like DRD2 (Dopamine Receptor D2), HTR1A (Serotonin Receptor 1A), and HTR2A (Serotonin Receptor 2A).
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH-) indicates the molecule could be involved in interactions with enzymes or transporters that recognize or bind to such functional groups. This structural element might be relevant to the function of CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism and have carboxamide-containing substrates.
Step 3: The molecule includes a chlorinated benzene ring, which could lead to interactions with proteins that have specific affinities for aromatic compounds. This structural pattern may be relevant to the function of genes like ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein), which is involved in the efflux of various substrates including some aromatic compounds.
Step 4: The overall complexity and size of the molecule suggest it could interact with large protein complexes, which might be relevant to the functions of genes such as PTGS1 (Cyclooxygenase-1), which is involved in prostaglandin synthesis and could potentially be influenced by larger molecules.
Step 5: The combination of heterocyclic rings, carboxamides, and aromatic substituents in the molecule's structure suggests potential interactions with a variety of proteins involved in signal transduction and receptor activation, including genes like HRH1 (Histamine H1 Receptor) and KDR (Kinase Domain Receptor).
