Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CNC(=O)COC(=O)c1cc(-c2ccco2)nc2ccccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that has a benzene ring system with a carboxamide group attached to it. This structure suggests the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and carboxamide functional groups is characteristic of compounds that can interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4). These receptors are known to have binding sites for ligands with similar chemical structures.
Step 3: Additionally, the benzene ring and carboxamide group might also suggest potential interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs and endogenous compounds. The molecule's ability to bind to these enzymes could affect their activity and lead to pharmacological effects.
Step 4: The presence of a benzene ring and carboxamide group also indicates the possibility of interaction with ion channels, particularly those that are voltage-gated calcium channels (CACNA1H) or potassium channels (KCNH2).
Step 5: Given the structure of the molecule, it is likely to interact with multiple genes listed above, including but not limited to: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CACNA1H, and KCNH2.
