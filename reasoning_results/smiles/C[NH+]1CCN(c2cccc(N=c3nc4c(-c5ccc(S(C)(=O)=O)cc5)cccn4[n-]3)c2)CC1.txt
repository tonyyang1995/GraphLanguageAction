Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+]1CCN(c2cccc(N=c3nc4c(-c5ccc(S(C)(=O)=O)cc5)cccn4[n-]3)c2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure containing an amine group (NH+), a benzene ring, and several heterocycles including pyrrole, thiophene, and a thiazole. This indicates that the molecule likely interacts with proteins that have binding sites for aromatic and heterocyclic compounds.
Step 2: The presence of a thiazole ring suggests potential interaction with enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize drugs containing thiazole moieties. Additionally, the molecule's overall structure could influence its pharmacokinetics through these enzymes.
Step 3: The amine group (NH+) might interact with receptors like HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are involved in serotonin signaling. Serotonin receptors often bind to amines, making this feature relevant.
Step 4: The benzene ring and heterocycles in the molecule could also be recognized by enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, due to their ability to form stable interactions with aromatic and heteroaromatic structures.
Step 5: Given the molecular features described, the related genes are primarily those involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmitter signaling. Specifically, the related gene names are:
- CYP1A2
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
These genes are directly or indirectly related to the molecule's structure and potential biological activity. 
Summary of related genes:
Note: The other listed genes do not appear to have a direct or obvious relationship with the molecule based on the provided structural information. However, further research may reveal indirect connections or specific conditions under which these genes could be relevant.
