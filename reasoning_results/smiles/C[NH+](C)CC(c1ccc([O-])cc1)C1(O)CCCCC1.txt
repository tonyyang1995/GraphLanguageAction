Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+](C)CC(c1ccc([O-])cc1)C1(O)CCCCC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this relationship might be important.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring (N) attached to a benzene ring (C), which is characteristic of many ligands that interact with receptors such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature suggests potential interaction with receptors encoded by genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, and ADRB2, all of which are involved in signaling pathways mediated by GPCRs.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a pyridine ring (N) and a carboxylate group (-COOH), which are common functional groups found in ligands that can bind to enzymes. Enzymes encoded by genes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism, may have binding sites that could interact with this functional group.
Step 3: The presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) in the molecule indicates it could potentially interact with proteins involved in cellular signaling and transcription regulation. Genes like PTGS1, which encodes COX-2, a key enzyme in inflammation and pain pathways, might have binding sites for this molecule.
Step 4: The molecule has a quinoline ring (quinoline is a type of heterocyclic aromatic compound), which can form hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions. These interactions are relevant to the binding of ligands to receptors, such as those encoded by HRH1, which is involved in histamine signaling.
Step 5: Given the complex structure and multiple functional groups, the molecule is likely to interact with a variety of genes involved in different biological processes, including receptor signaling (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HRH1) and metabolic pathways (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6). Additionally, it may interact with genes involved in inflammation (PTGS1) and neurotransmitter signaling (HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C).
