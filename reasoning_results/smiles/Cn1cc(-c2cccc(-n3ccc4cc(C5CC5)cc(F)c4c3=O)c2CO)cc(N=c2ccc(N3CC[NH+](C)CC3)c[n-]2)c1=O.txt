Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cn1cc(-c2cccc(-n3ccc4cc(C5CC5)cc(F)c4c3=O)c2CO)cc(N=c2ccc(N3CC[NH+](C)CC3)c[n-]2)c1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with multiple functional groups such as amides, esters, phenols, and ethers. This structure indicates the molecule could potentially interact with proteins that have binding sites for these functional groups.
Step 2: Analyzing the structure further, the presence of an amide group (-N=C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) suggests the molecule might be able to form hydrogen bonds and possibly act as a ligand for receptors or enzymes containing protein binding pockets that can accommodate such functional groups.
Step 3: The molecule also contains aromatic rings (cyclohexene and benzene rings), which are common in many drugs and can interact with proteins through π-π stacking and hydrophobic interactions. These interactions can influence the binding affinity and specificity of the molecule to certain proteins.
Step 4: Given the presence of these functional groups and structural features, the molecule may interact with proteins encoded by genes involved in neurotransmitter signaling, receptor function, and drug metabolism. This includes genes such as DRD2 (Dopamine Receptor D2), HTR1A (Serotonin Receptor 1A), CYP2D6 (Cytochrome P450 2D6), and CYP3A4 (Cytochrome P450 3A4).
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interaction sites, the related genes include: DRD2, HTR1A, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. These genes are involved in neurotransmitter signaling and drug metabolism, respectively. 
Summary of Related Genes: DRD2, HTR1A, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
