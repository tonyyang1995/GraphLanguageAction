Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure featuring a central benzene ring connected to a cyclohexene ring, which is further linked to a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring (indicated by 'c1ccc(CC(O)=NO)cc1'). This structure suggests potential interactions with receptors that have similar chemical moieties, such as amino acids or nucleotides.
Step 2: The presence of a nitro group (-NO) and an amide group (CON) in the molecule indicates it could interact with enzymes or receptors involved in signaling pathways, particularly those associated with neurotransmission or inflammatory responses.
Step 3: Considering the structure and functional groups present, this molecule might interact with genes encoding for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or enzymes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are involved in the metabolism of various drugs and endogenous compounds.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule’s structure may suggest potential interactions with genes related to neuronal function and neurotransmission, such as HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A), HTR2B (serotonin receptor 2B), and DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), due to the presence of functional groups that could mimic or bind to neurotransmitters.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and the potential interactions described, the related genes include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, and DRD2.
