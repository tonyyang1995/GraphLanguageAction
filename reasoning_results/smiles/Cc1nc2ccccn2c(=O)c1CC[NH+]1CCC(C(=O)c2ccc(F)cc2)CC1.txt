Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1nc2ccccn2c(=O)c1CC[NH+]1CCC(C(=O)c2ccc(F)cc2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule contains several functional groups such as amide (C(=O)N), aromatic rings (c1nc2ccccn2), and heteroatoms like nitrogen and fluorine. These features suggest that the molecule could be an agonist or antagonist for receptors or enzymes that interact with these chemical moieties.
Step 2: Looking at the genes, those involved in neurotransmitter systems and receptor activity are likely to have a direct interaction with this molecule due to its chemical structure. Genes such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4 encode dopamine receptors, which often bind to molecules with amide groups and aromatic structures.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of fluorine in the molecule suggests potential interactions with proteins containing cysteine residues through hydrogen bonding or other non-covalent interactions. This could be relevant to genes like HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which encode serotonin receptors.
Step 4: The molecule also has a structure that could interact with enzymes involved in metabolism. Genes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are involved in drug metabolism and could potentially be affected by this molecule.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the related genes include: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
