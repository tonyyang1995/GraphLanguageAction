Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1[n-]cc(F)c(=O)[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) attached to a benzene ring, which is a common feature in many drugs that interact with receptors and enzymes. This structural pattern suggests potential interactions with genes encoding for receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a fluorine atom (F) indicates the molecule may have specific binding affinity for certain proteins due to its electronegativity, potentially affecting proteins involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 3: The molecule has a heterocyclic amine structure, which is known to interact with various receptor types, including G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 encode for GPCRs.
Step 4: The presence of an imidazole ring and carboxylic acid group suggests potential interactions with enzymes like CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 5: Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. These genes encode for receptors and enzymes that could be directly affected by the molecule. Step 5: Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. These genes encode for receptors and enzymes that could be directly affected by the molecule.
