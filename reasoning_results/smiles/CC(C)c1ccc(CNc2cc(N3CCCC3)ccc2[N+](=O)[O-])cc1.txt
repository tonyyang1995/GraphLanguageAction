Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)c1ccc(CNc2cc(N3CCCC3)ccc2[N+](=O)[O-])cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a complex structure including a benzene ring system, a pyrrole ring, and a heterocyclic nitrogen-containing moiety. This pattern suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP), which are encoded by genes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
Step 2: The presence of a quinolone-like structure within the molecule indicates it could interact with DNA-binding proteins or enzymes that modulate DNA function, possibly relating to genes involved in cell cycle regulation and DNA repair, such as CDK2 and PTGS1 (also known as COX-2).
Step 3: The nitrogen-containing heterocycles and amide functionalities in the molecule suggest potential for interactions with receptors and ion channels, particularly those involved in neurotransmission and pain modulation, such as DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, and SIGMAR1.
Step 4: Given the presence of a nitrophenyl group and amide functionality, the molecule might also interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels, potentially affecting genes like CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and OPRK1.
Step 5: The overall structure and functional groups present in the molecule indicate it may have effects on genes involved in signal transduction pathways and receptor activity, such as LCK, HRH1, and ESR1.
