Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)(C)[NH2+]Cc1ccc(N=c2cc[n-]c3cc(Cl)ccc23)cc1[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure including an amine group (-NH2), a positively charged nitrogen atom, and a negatively charged oxygen atom. This indicates that it is likely a small molecule drug or ligand.
Step 2: The presence of the positively charged nitrogen atom suggests that this molecule could act as an agonist or inhibitor for receptors that have a binding site for basic amino groups, such as certain G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The negatively charged oxygen atom indicates that the molecule might interact with proteins containing negatively charged residues, which could be relevant for ion channels or transporters.
Step 4: Given the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the molecule may be related to GPCRs (e.g., ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) due to the amine group and positively charged nitrogen, and ion channels (e.g., KCNH2) due to the negatively charged oxygen.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule might interact with enzymes like CYP2D6, which metabolizes many drugs, due to its complex structure.
