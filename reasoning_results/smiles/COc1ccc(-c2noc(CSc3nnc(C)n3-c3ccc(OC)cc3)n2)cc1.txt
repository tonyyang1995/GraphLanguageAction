Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(-c2noc(CSc3nnc(C)n3-c3ccc(OC)cc3)n2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule, which appears to contain several functional groups such as amide, ester, and aromatic rings. Notably, the presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) suggests that this molecule could have both acidic and basic functionalities.
Step 2: Given the presence of these functional groups, the molecule might interact with proteins that are involved in cellular signaling pathways or enzymatic activities. For example, the carboxylic acid group could interact with receptors or ion channels that have acidic binding sites, while the phenolic hydroxyl group could potentially interact with enzymes or receptors that have hydroxyl-binding pockets.
Step 3: Among the listed genes, those involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling and neurotransmitter transport might be particularly relevant due to their interaction with small molecules. Genes such as DRD2 (Dopamine Receptor D2), HTR1A (Serotonin Receptor 1A), and CHRM1 (Cholinergic Receptor M1) encode for receptors that bind various ligands, including small molecules with acidic and hydroxyl functionalities.
Step 4: Additionally, genes involved in cytochrome P450 metabolism, such as CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, could also be relevant if the molecule is a substrate for these enzymes, as it would impact drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and the potential interactions described, the related genes include: DRD2, HTR1A, CHRM1, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2
- HTR1A
- CHRM1
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6 Step 5: Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2D6
These genes are likely to be influenced by the molecule due to its functional groups and potential interactions with receptor sites and metabolic pathways.
