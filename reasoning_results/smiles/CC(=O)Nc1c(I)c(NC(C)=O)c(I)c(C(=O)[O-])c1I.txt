Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(=O)Nc1c(I)c(NC(C)=O)c(I)c(C(=O)[O-])c1I, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups including an amide (C=O), a nitrogen atom with an attached acetyl group (Nc1c(I)c(NC(C)=O)), and an iodine atom (I). The presence of an amide suggests that this molecule could be a potential ligand or substrate for enzymes involved in metabolism.
Step 2: The acetyl group attached to the nitrogen indicates that this molecule might interact with proteins containing acetyltransferase activity, such as histone deacetylases (HDACs) or other deacetylase enzymes, which are often associated with the regulation of gene expression.
Step 3: The presence of an iodine atom (-I) and the overall complexity of the molecule suggest it may have hormonal or receptor-binding properties, potentially interacting with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 4: Given the pattern of the molecule, there is also a possibility of interaction with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs and xenobiotics, indicating that this molecule could be metabolized by these enzymes.
Step 5: Considering the diverse interactions suggested, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. 
Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
