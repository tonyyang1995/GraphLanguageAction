Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])CSc1nc2ccccc2[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string O=C([O-])CSc1nc2ccccc2[n-]1 is a complex organic compound that includes a pyrrole ring system, a phenol group, and a quinoline-like structure. The presence of a negatively charged oxygen atom (-O) and a negatively charged nitrogen atom ([n-]) indicates that the molecule could be an ionizable compound, which might affect its interaction with certain ion channels and receptors.
Step 2: The molecule's structure suggests potential interactions with genes involved in the regulation of ion channels and neurotransmitter transport. For example, it could interact with genes encoding for ion channels such as KCNH2 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2), which codes for a cardiac potassium channel that is sensitive to changes in pH and can be influenced by acidic conditions.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a phenolic group could suggest potential interactions with genes associated with drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are cytochrome P450 enzymes responsible for metabolizing various drugs, including those that might bind to this molecule.
Step 4: The molecule's structure also hints at possible interactions with genes related to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Specifically, the quinoline-like structure could interact with genes like DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2) and HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A), both of which are GPCRs involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways.
Step 5: Given the above analysis, the related genes to this molecule are likely to include: KCNH2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, DRD2, and HTR2A. These genes play crucial roles in ion channel function, drug metabolism, and neurotransmitter signaling, which are all areas where the described molecular structure could have significant implications.
