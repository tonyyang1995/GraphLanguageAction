Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cn1c(=O)c2[n-]cnc2n(C)c1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule is a derivative of anandamide, which is a natural endocannabinoid. It contains a cyclohexene ring fused to a benzene ring, with a carboxamide group attached to the benzene ring. This structure is characteristic of cannabinoids and their analogs.
Step 2: The presence of the carboxamide group suggests that this molecule could interact with cannabinoid receptors, particularly CB1 (encoded by CNR1) and CB2 (not listed here but also relevant).
Step 3: The cyclic structure and the presence of nitrogen atoms might also allow for interactions with other receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B) and dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), given their common structural motifs involving aromatic rings and heteroatoms.
Step 4: The molecule's potential to modulate neurotransmitter release or receptor activity could influence genes involved in neurotransmission pathways, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode serotonin receptors.
Step 5: Given the molecule's possible interaction with cannabinoid receptors and its potential effects on neurotransmission, the related genes are: CNR1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6. Step 1: The molecule is a derivative of anandamide, which is a natural endocannabinoid.
Step 2: The presence of the carboxamide group suggests that this molecule could interact with cannabinoid receptors.
Step 3: The cyclic structure and nitrogen atoms might also allow for interactions with adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors.
Step 4: Potential modulation of neurotransmitter release or receptor activity could affect genes involved in neurotransmission.
Step 5: Related genes include: CNR1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
