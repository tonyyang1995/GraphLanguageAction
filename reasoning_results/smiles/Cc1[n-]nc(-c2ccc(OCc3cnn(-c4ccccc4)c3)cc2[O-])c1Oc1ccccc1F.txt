Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1[n-]nc(-c2ccc(OCc3cnn(-c4ccccc4)c3)cc2[O-])c1Oc1ccccc1F, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule containing a nitrogen atom with a negative charge (-) in a cyclic structure, along with oxygen, carbon, and fluorine atoms. This structure likely corresponds to a pharmaceutical compound with potential pharmacological activity.
Step 2: Analyzing the pattern of the molecule, it includes functional groups such as an amide (N-C), an ester (O-C-O), and a hydroxyl group (-OH). These functional groups are often involved in binding to proteins and can influence receptor interactions.
Step 3: Given the presence of a negatively charged nitrogen and a hydroxyl group, this molecule could interact with receptors that have positively charged binding sites or that are activated by small molecules with hydroxyl functionalities. This suggests potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 4: Among the listed genes, several encode GPCRs including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes encode for various subtypes of adrenergic, cholinergic, and dopaminergic receptors, which are known to be activated by ligands with similar functional groups.
Step 5: Based on the structure and functional groups present in the molecule, it is most likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes encode receptors that could potentially bind to or be modulated by the described molecule. 
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
