Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCN(C(=O)c1c(C)[nH]c(C(=O)OCC)c1C)c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule has a complex structure including multiple aromatic rings, a benzene ring, and several functional groups such as amide, carbonyl, and amine. These structural features suggest that the molecule could be involved in interactions with proteins that have similar functional groups or binding sites.
Step 2: Considering the presence of an amide group (N(C(=O)c1c(C)[nH]c(C(=O)OCC)c1C)) and a benzene ring, this molecule might interact with enzymes that metabolize drugs or other small molecules. CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 are known cytochrome P450 enzymes that play significant roles in drug metabolism. Therefore, the molecule could potentially affect the activity or expression of these enzymes.
Step 3: The molecule also contains an amine group (CCCN(C(=O)c1c(C)[nH]) which might interact with receptors or transporters that have a complementary binding site. For example, the amine group could bind to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), or cannabinoid receptors (CNR1).
Step 4: The overall structure and functional groups suggest that the molecule might interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways. HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 are serotonin receptors, which are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that mediate various physiological responses. Similarly, HRH1 (histamine receptor H1) and PTGS1 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1) could also be relevant targets based on their structure.
Step 5: Based on the analysis of the molecule's structure and potential interactions, the related genes include CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, and PTGS1.
