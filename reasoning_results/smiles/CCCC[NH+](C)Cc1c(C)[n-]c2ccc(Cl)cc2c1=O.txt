Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCC[NH+](C)Cc1c(C)[n-]c2ccc(Cl)cc2c1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has several functional groups including amine (NH+), aromatic ring (c1c(C)[n-]c2ccc(Cl)cc2c1), and a carbonyl group (C=O). The amine group indicates basicity, and the aromatic ring suggests potential for hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. The presence of chlorine (-Cl) may contribute to electrophilic reactions.
Step 2: Considering the structure, this molecule likely interacts with proteins that have binding sites for basic amino acids, aromatic residues, or both. Additionally, its ability to form hydrogen bonds due to the amine and possibly the carbonyl group could be relevant for protein interactions involving such groups.
Step 3: Analyzing the provided gene list, several genes encode receptors or enzymes that interact with molecules through these types of functional groups. For instance, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C are serotonin receptors that bind to basic amino acid ligands, suggesting a possible interaction with the amine group of the molecule. Similarly, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 are cytochrome P450 enzymes that can metabolize molecules containing aromatic rings.
Step 4: Furthermore, CYP3A4 is another important cytochrome P450 enzyme that could interact with the aromatic ring of the molecule. Additionally, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4 are dopamine receptors that might bind to the amine group of the molecule, considering their affinity for basic amino acid ligands.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis and the potential interactions described above, the related genes include: HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4. These genes encode proteins that may interact with or be influenced by the given molecule through its functional groups and overall structure.
