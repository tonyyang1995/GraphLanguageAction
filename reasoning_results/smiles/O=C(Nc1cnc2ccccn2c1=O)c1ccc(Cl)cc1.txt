Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Nc1cnc2ccccn2c1=O)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring fused to an imidazole ring, which is characteristic of many G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature suggests potential interaction with receptors that have similar binding sites.
Step 2: The molecule also has a quinoline-like structure, which can be recognized by certain enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2D6 and CYP3A4.
Step 3: Given the presence of a nitrogen atom in the imidazole ring, the molecule could interact with receptors that have histamine binding sites, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C.
Step 4: The molecule's aromatic and polar functional groups suggest it may modulate ion channels, potentially interacting with KCNH2.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure, the molecule might interact with multiple neurotransmitter receptors and enzymes, including CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and KCNH2.
Related gene names: CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, KCNH2. Step 5: The molecule's complex structure and functional groups indicate potential interactions with various neurotransmitter receptors and enzymes, such as CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and KCNH2. 
Related gene names: CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, KCNH2.
