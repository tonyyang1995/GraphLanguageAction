Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(=O)OCC(COC(C)=O)OC(C)=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this is relevant.
Step 1: The molecule has a structure that includes a benzene ring, an amide group (-CO-NH-), and multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups. This structure is characteristic of molecules that can interact with various receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of the amide group suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize compounds containing amide bonds.
Step 3: The multiple hydroxyl groups indicate potential interactions with receptors that bind to hydroxyl-containing ligands, such as HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A) and HTR2B (serotonin receptor 2B).
Step 4: The benzene ring in the molecule could also interact with proteins that have a binding site for aromatic compounds, such as PTGS1 (cyclooxygenase 1).
Step 5: Based on the structural features, the molecule may be related to the genes CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A, HTR2B, and PTGS1.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A, HTR2B, PTGS1.
