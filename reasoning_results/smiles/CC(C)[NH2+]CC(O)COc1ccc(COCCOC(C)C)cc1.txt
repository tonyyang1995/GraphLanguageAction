Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)[NH2+]CC(O)COc1ccc(COCCOC(C)C)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups including an amide group (-NH2), a carboxylate group (-COO-), and several aromatic rings. The presence of these functional groups suggests that the molecule could potentially interact with proteins involved in signaling pathways or metabolic processes.
Step 2: The aromatic ring system in the molecule, particularly the one containing oxygen and carbon atoms (c1ccc(COCCOC(C)C)cc1), may suggest a potential interaction with receptors or enzymes that recognize such structures. This pattern is often found in ligands for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other membrane-bound proteins.
Step 3: Given the presence of a carboxylate group and the overall structure, the molecule might be a candidate for binding to ion channels, transporters, or enzymes involved in metabolism. For example, it could potentially interact with voltage-gated potassium channels, which are encoded by genes like KCNH2, or with cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are involved in drug metabolism and are encoded by genes like CYP2C9 and CYP2D6.
Step 4: Considering the potential interactions with ion channels and metabolic enzymes, the molecule could influence neurotransmitter release or receptor signaling, which would be relevant to genes encoding neurotransmitter receptors and signaling molecules. Examples include HTR2A (serotonin 5-HT2A receptor), DRD2 (dopamine D2 receptor), and CHRM1 (cholinergic receptor, muscarinic 1).
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and potential interactions, the related genes include: CYP2C9, CYP2D6, KCNH2, HTR2A, DRD2, and CHRM1.
