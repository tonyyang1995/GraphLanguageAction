Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N=c1c2c([n-]c3ccccc13)CCCC2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule with a nitrogen atom that forms a triple bond with carbon (N=c1), indicating a nitrile group. This nitrile group is attached to a benzene ring, which is further substituted with a nitrogen atom bearing a negative charge (-) and a cyclohexane ring. The benzene ring is also connected to a series of carbon atoms forming a long alkyl chain.
Step 2: The molecular structure suggests that it could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors involved in signal transduction pathways. The presence of a negatively charged nitrogen atom and a long alkyl chain indicates potential interactions with proteins such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or ion channels.
Step 3: Considering the pattern of the molecule, it might interact with GPCRs due to its long alkyl chain, which can act as a hydrophobic ligand, and the negatively charged nitrogen, which can interact with positively charged residues on the receptor surface. GPCRs are known to be involved in various signaling pathways and are associated with multiple genes listed above, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 4: The molecule’s structure may also suggest interactions with ion channels, particularly those containing the KCNH2 subunit, given the presence of a benzene ring and a long alkyl chain. Ion channels like KCNH2 are associated with HRH1 and possibly other genes related to ion transport and signaling.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to have a relationship with several genes, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, and KCNH2.
