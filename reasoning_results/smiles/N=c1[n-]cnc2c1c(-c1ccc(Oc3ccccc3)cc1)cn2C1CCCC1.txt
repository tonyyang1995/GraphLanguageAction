Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N=c1[n-]cnc2c1c(-c1ccc(Oc3ccccc3)cc1)cn2C1CCCC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen-nitrogen double bond (N=N) and a tricyclic structure with a benzene ring fused to an imidazole ring, which is characteristic of many ligands for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural pattern suggests potential interactions with GPCRs.
Step 2: The presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) and an oxygen-containing heterocyclic ring (likely a pyrrole or pyridine) indicates possible interactions with enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a cyclic amide (N-C), which could interact with ion channels, particularly those involving calcium (CACNA1H) or potassium (KCNH2).
Step 4: Given the complex structure and presence of multiple functional groups, the molecule may influence receptors and transporters involved in neurotransmission, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and SLC6A4.
Step 5: The molecule may also interact with genes involved in signal transduction pathways, such as PTGS1, which codes for cyclooxygenase-1, an enzyme involved in prostaglandin synthesis.
