Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCc1c(OCCCOc2ccc(OCC(=O)[O-])cc2)ccc(C(C)=O)c1[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings, oxygen-containing functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, carboxyl), and a negatively charged group (-O-). This structure suggests that it may be involved in interactions with proteins that have binding sites for similar chemical motifs.
Step 2: Considering the presence of aromatic rings and the presence of functional groups such as carboxyl and hydroxyl, this molecule likely interacts with enzymes and receptors that are involved in metabolism and signal transduction pathways. This could include proteins encoded by genes such as CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are known to metabolize drugs and other xenobiotics.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a carboxyl group and a negatively charged group could indicate potential interactions with ion channels or transporters. Genes like KCNH2, which encodes the cardiac potassium channel hERG, and SLC6A4, which encodes a sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter, might be relevant due to their involvement in ion transport and neurotransmitter reuptake.
Step 4: The molecule's structure also suggests possible interactions with receptors that recognize ligands with similar chemical properties. This could involve genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and DRD2, which are involved in the regulation of neurotransmission and are targets for various therapeutic agents.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related genes include those involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), ion transport (KCNH2, SLC6A4), neurotransmission (HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2), and potentially others involved in signaling pathways or metabolic processes that interact with the described chemical structure.
