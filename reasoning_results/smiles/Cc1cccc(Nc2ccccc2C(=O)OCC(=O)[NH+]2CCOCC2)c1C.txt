Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cccc(Nc2ccccc2C(=O)OCC(=O)[NH+]2CCOCC2)c1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure containing aromatic rings, a pyridine ring, and a pyrrolidine ring. It also includes a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an amide group (-CONH2). The presence of a carboxylic acid and an amide suggests that this molecule could be a small molecule inhibitor or activator of enzymes or receptors.
Step 2: Analyzing the genes provided, we look for those involved in drug metabolism, receptor function, and signaling pathways. Genes such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 are involved in the metabolism of drugs through the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. These enzymes are responsible for the oxidation of various substrates, including many drugs.
Step 3: Another set of genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4 encode for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are often targets for small molecules due to their role in signal transduction pathways and their importance in neurotransmission.
Step 4: The molecule's structure, particularly its ability to interact with proteins through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions, makes it plausible that it could interact with the proteins encoded by the above-mentioned genes. For instance, it could potentially bind to and modulate the activity of enzymes like those in the CYP family or receptors like the dopamine receptors encoded by DRD genes.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and potential interaction with proteins, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
