Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cn1cc([N+](=O)[O-])c(C(=O)N=c2ccc(Br)c[n-]2)n1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom that is part of an amide group (-CONH2) and has a positively charged nitrogen atom (N+) connected to an oxygen atom, forming a carboxylate ion (-COO-). This indicates the presence of a potential ligand for receptors that bind to amino groups or carboxylate ions.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a benzene ring with a bromine substituent, which could interact with certain receptors or enzymes through hydrophobic interactions or other non-covalent binding modes.
Step 3: Among the provided genes, several are involved in neurotransmitter receptor signaling pathways, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4. These genes encode receptors for serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine, respectively, which often have ligands that contain amino or carboxylate groups.
Step 4: Additionally, some genes encode enzymes that may metabolize drugs or xenobiotics, including CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. The presence of a benzene ring and a carboxylate ion suggests the molecule might be recognized or metabolized by these enzymes.
Step 5: Based on the structural features of the molecule, it is likely to interact with or be metabolized by the following genes: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.
Summary of related gene names: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom that is part of an amide group (-CONH2) and has a positively charged nitrogen atom (N+) connected to an oxygen atom, forming a carboxylate ion (-COO-). This indicates the presence of a potential ligand for receptors that bind to amino groups or carboxylate ions.
Step 4: Additionally, some genes encode enzymes that may metabolize drugs or xenobiotics, including CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C
