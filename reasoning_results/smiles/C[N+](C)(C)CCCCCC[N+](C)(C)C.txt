Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[N+](C)(C)CCCCCC[N+](C)(C)C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule given has a quaternary ammonium structure with two positively charged nitrogen atoms (N+), which are bonded to multiple carbon atoms. This structure suggests that it may act as a cationic compound, potentially interacting with proteins that have ion channel or receptor functions.
Step 2: The pattern of having multiple carbon chains attached to the positively charged nitrogen atoms indicates that this molecule could interact with membrane proteins such as ion channels or receptors. The length and arrangement of these carbon chains could influence its ability to bind to specific protein targets.
Step 3: Among the provided genes, those involved in ion channel function, receptor activity, and neurotransmitter signaling are most likely to be influenced by the molecule's structure. These include genes encoding for various types of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels.
Step 4: Specifically, the molecule might interact with genes like CHRM1 (muscarinic acetylcholine receptor), CHRM3 (muscarinic acetylcholine receptor), CHRM4 (muscarinic acetylcholine receptor), HTR1A (serotonin receptor), HTR2A (serotonin receptor), HTR2B (serotonin receptor), and HTR2C (serotonin receptor), as they all encode for GPCRs that could potentially interact with the positively charged nitrogen groups of the molecule.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule could also interact with genes encoding ion channels such as KCNH2 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2), which is involved in cardiac potassium channel function, and KDR (kinase insert domain receptor), which plays a role in angiogenesis and vascular development.
Summary of related gene names:
- CHRM1
- CHRM3
- CHRM4
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- KCNH2
- KDR Step 5: The molecule's structure and properties suggest potential interactions with genes involved in ion channel function and receptor activity, particularly those encoding muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4) and serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C). It may also interact with genes like KCNH2 (potassium voltage-gated channel) and KDR (kinase insert domain receptor). 
- KDR
These genes are the most relevant based on the molecule's structure and potential biological interactions. Other genes listed are less likely to be directly affected by this specific molecule due to their different functions and mechanisms.
