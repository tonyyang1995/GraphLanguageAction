Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings, including a benzene ring and a furan ring. It also contains several functional groups such as amine, ester, and fluorine substituents.
Step 2: Considering the presence of a benzene ring and amine group, this molecule could potentially interact with receptors that have similar chemical features. This includes adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), cholinergic receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), and dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4).
Step 3: The presence of a furan ring and fluorine substituents suggests that the molecule may have some affinity for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Among the provided genes, GPCRs include HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 4: The molecule's structure also indicates potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of various drugs.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions with receptors and enzymes, the related genes are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6.
