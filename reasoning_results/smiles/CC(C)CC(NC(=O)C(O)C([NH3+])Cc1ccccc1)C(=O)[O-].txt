Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)CC(NC(=O)C(O)C([NH3+])Cc1ccccc1)C(=O)[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is common in many drugs and small molecules that interact with receptors or transporters. This structural feature suggests potential interactions with genes encoding proteins involved in drug metabolism or receptor signaling.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-CONH-) indicates the molecule could be an inhibitor or substrate for enzymes involved in amide metabolism, such as CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, which are known to metabolize various drugs including those containing amide groups.
Step 3: The presence of a carboxylate group (-COOH) and a quaternary ammonium salt (-N+(CH3)4) suggests the molecule might interact with ion channels or transporters. Genes such as KCNH2 (encoding hERG potassium channel), SLC6A2 (serotonin transporter), and SLC6A4 (norepinephrine transporter) could be relevant here.
Step 4: The molecule's overall size and functional groups suggest it could bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Genes like DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), HTR2A (serotonin receptor 5-HT2A), and HRH1 (histamine receptor H1) encode GPCRs that might interact with this molecule.
Step 5: Given the complexity and specific functional groups of the molecule, it is likely to have multiple interactions with different genes, including but not limited to: CYP2D6, CYP2C19, KCNH2, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, DRD2, HTR2A, and HRH1.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2D6, CYP2C19, KCNH2, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, DRD2, HTR2A, HRH1.
