Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc2c(c1)Cc1c(C(=O)[N-]N3CCCCC3)nn(-c3ccc(Cl)cc3Cl)c1-2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule is a complex organic compound with multiple functional groups, including a benzene ring, a carbonyl group, and several nitrogen-containing heterocycles. These structural features suggest that the molecule may interact with proteins involved in signal transduction, neurotransmission, and enzyme activity.
Step 2: Considering the presence of a benzene ring and a carbonyl group, this molecule could potentially bind to or modulate the activity of enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: The nitrogen-containing heterocycles, particularly the imidazole and pyrrolidine rings, indicate that the molecule might interact with receptors or ion channels. For instance, it could target HTR2A (serotonin receptor), HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 (serotonin receptors), which are involved in regulating mood and other physiological processes.
Step 4: Given the presence of a quaternary ammonium group (-N+), this molecule could also interact with ion channels such as KCNH2 (hERG potassium channel), which is associated with cardiac function and arrhythmias.
Step 5: Based on the identified structural features, the molecule is most likely to be related to the following genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and KCNH2. These genes encode proteins that are directly involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmission, and ion channel function.
