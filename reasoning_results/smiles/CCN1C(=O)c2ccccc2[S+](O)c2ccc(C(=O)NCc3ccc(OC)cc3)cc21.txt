Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCN1C(=O)c2ccccc2[S+](O)c2ccc(C(=O)NCc3ccc(OC)cc3)cc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with an amide group attached, which is characteristic of many ligands that interact with receptors and transporters. This structural feature suggests potential interactions with genes encoding for receptors or transporters.
Step 2: The presence of a sulfoxide group ([S+](O)) indicates the molecule could be a modulator of enzymes involved in metabolism or signaling pathways. Several genes listed are known to encode enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The molecule also has a phenolic hydroxyl group (OC), which can participate in hydrogen bonding and can interact with proteins containing binding sites for small molecules. Genes like HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which encode serotonin receptors, might be influenced by this functionality.
Step 4: The overall structure includes a quinoline-like moiety, which can interact with ion channels and receptors. Genes like KCNH2, which encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel, could be relevant due to the presence of aromatic rings and a possible interaction with ion conduction.
Step 5: The molecule’s complex structure with multiple functional groups and rings suggests it could interact with various proteins, including kinases and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Genes such as LCK, which encodes a tyrosine kinase, and ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, which encode adrenergic receptors, might have a relationship with this molecule.
