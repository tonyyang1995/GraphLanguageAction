Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NNc1ccc(S(N)(=O)=O)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a heterocyclic amide, specifically a pyrrolidine derivative with a sulfur atom in its ring and a carboxamide group. This structure is not directly indicative of any particular gene function but could potentially interact with receptors or enzymes encoded by certain genes.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide (-CONH2) functional group suggests that this molecule might be an inhibitor or substrate for enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP (cytochrome P450) genes. Among the provided genes, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 are all known to be involved in the metabolism of various drugs.
Step 3: Given the presence of a sulfonate group (-SO3H), which is part of the carboxamide, this molecule might also interact with enzymes that handle sulfonation reactions, such as those encoded by genes involved in phase II metabolism. This includes genes like SULT1A1, which is responsible for sulfation reactions, though it is not listed in the provided gene list.
Step 4: The molecule’s structure does not directly suggest interaction with ion channels or receptors based on the given gene list. However, some of the listed genes encode for receptors or ion channels, such as HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A) and KCNH2 (potassium channel subfamily H member 2), which could be indirectly influenced by the molecule through its metabolic effects or other pathways.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the most likely related genes from the provided list are those involved in drug metabolism and signaling pathways, particularly CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and possibly CYP1A2, as well as HTR2A for potential indirect effects.
Summary of Related Genes:
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
- CYP1A2
- HTR2A
These genes are involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmitter signaling, which could be relevant to the molecule's potential biological activity.
