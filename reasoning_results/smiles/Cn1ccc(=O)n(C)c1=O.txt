Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cn1ccc(=O)n(C)c1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that is a benzene ring system with an oxazole ring fused to it, containing a carbonyl group and a nitrogen atom with a double bond. This structure is characteristic of several classes of drugs, including those that interact with receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen with a double bond suggests potential for hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions with proteins, particularly receptor proteins. This could imply a relationship with genes encoding receptors such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The molecule also contains a carbonyl group, which is often found in substrates for enzymes like CYP enzymes involved in drug metabolism. This indicates a possible interaction with genes encoding cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
Step 4: Given the presence of a benzene ring, this structure might be recognized by certain transcription factors or could potentially bind to DNA, suggesting a possible interaction with genes involved in gene regulation, such as PPARG.
Step 5: The overall structure does not directly suggest a strong relationship with neurotransmitter receptors or kinases, but the potential for interactions with CYP enzymes and GPCRs means that several of the listed genes, especially those related to drug metabolism and receptor function, could be relevant.
