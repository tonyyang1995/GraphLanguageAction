Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(N=c1cc[n-]cc1)c1cc([N+](=O)[O-])ccc1Cl, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this relationship is important.
Step 1: The molecule is a benzodiazepine derivative, which contains a pyrrolidine ring, a pyridine ring, and a diazepine ring. This structure is often associated with ligands that interact with GABAA receptors, particularly those that modulate chloride channels. GABAA receptor subunits are encoded by various genes including GABRA1, GABRB1, and GABRG1, but none of these are listed in the provided gene list.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a phenyl ring with a chloro substituent, a feature commonly found in ligands targeting monoamine transporters such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Monoamine transporters are involved in the regulation of neurotransmitters and are encoded by genes like SLC6A2 (serotonin transporter), SLC6A4 (norepinephrine transporter), and SLC6A3 (dopamine transporter). However, SLC6A3 is not included in the provided gene list.
Step 3: The molecule has a cyano group attached to the nitrogen atom in the diazepine ring, which is characteristic of certain ligands that can act as partial agonists or antagonists at various receptor sites. This structural feature might suggest interaction with receptors such as muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (encoded by CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4) or opioid receptors (encoded by OPRK1 and OPRM1), but only OPRK1 is listed in the provided gene list.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a cyano group and the overall structure of the molecule could indicate potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4). These enzymes are listed in the provided gene list.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and the potential interactions with various receptors and enzymes, the molecule may be related to the following genes: SLC6A2, SLC6A4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, OPRK1, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.
