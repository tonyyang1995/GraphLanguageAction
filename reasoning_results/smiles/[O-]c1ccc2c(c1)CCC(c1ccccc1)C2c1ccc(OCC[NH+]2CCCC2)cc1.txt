Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [O-]c1ccc2c(c1)CCC(c1ccccc1)C2c1ccc(OCC[NH+]2CCCC2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a tricyclic core structure with an aromatic ring system and a negatively charged oxygen atom (-O), indicating potential interactions with ion channels or receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and a phenolic group (OCC) suggests possible interaction with enzymes such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The presence of a quinoline-like structure (C2c1ccc(OCC[NH+]2CCCC2)cc1) may indicate potential interactions with receptors like HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are serotonin receptors.
Step 4: The overall structure does not show direct interaction patterns with genes encoding for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) other than those mentioned above.
Step 5: The molecule potentially interacts with genes involved in neurotransmitter signaling (HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C) and drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19).
Summary of Related Genes: HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CYP2C9, CYP2C19. Step 1: The molecule contains a tricyclic core structure with an aromatic ring system and a negatively charged oxygen atom (-O), indicating potential interactions with ion channels or receptors.
Summary of Related Genes: HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CYP2C9, CYP2C19.
