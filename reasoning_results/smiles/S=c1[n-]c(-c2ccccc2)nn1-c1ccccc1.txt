Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: S=c1[n-]c(-c2ccccc2)nn1-c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule in question contains a nitrogen atom that is negatively charged (-), which suggests it has basic properties and could interact with acidic residues on proteins, including receptors. The presence of multiple aromatic rings (indicated by the benzene rings in the SMILES string) suggests potential interactions with proteins containing aromatic amino acids.
Step 2: Given the complex structure, including the nitrogen-containing heterocycle and aromatic rings, this molecule likely interacts with proteins involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways due to its potential to bind to and modulate the activity of such receptors.
Step 3: Considering the specific gene names provided, several are known to encode GPCRs or are associated with neurotransmitter systems. For example, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C all encode subtypes of adrenergic and serotonergic receptors, which are known to be modulated by various ligands.
Step 4: Additionally, CYP enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are involved in drug metabolism and could interact with this molecule if it is a substrate or inhibitor of these enzymes. This interaction would be indirect but significant for pharmacological actions of the molecule.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and the potential interactions discussed, the molecule is most likely related to the genes encoding adrenergic and serotonergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C) and CYP enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6).
