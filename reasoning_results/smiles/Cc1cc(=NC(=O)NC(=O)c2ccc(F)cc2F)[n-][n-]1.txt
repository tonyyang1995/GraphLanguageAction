Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc(=NC(=O)NC(=O)c2ccc(F)cc2F)[n-][n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound that includes a benzene ring (Cc1cc), a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring (n-), and a trifluoromethyl group (-F). It also has two nitro groups (-NO2) and two acetyl groups (-COCH3). The presence of these functional groups suggests that the molecule may interact with proteins involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmission.
Step 2: Considering the molecule's structure, it contains multiple nitrogen atoms which could potentially form hydrogen bonds or act as binding sites for proteins. Additionally, the presence of an amide group (-CONH-) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) indicates the molecule might be capable of forming ester or amide bonds, which are important in protein-ligand interactions.
Step 3: The nitro groups (-NO2) in the molecule are known to be substrates for enzymes like cytochrome P450 (CYP) family members, particularly CYP2E1 and CYP2C9. These enzymes are involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics and drugs, making them relevant to the function of the given molecule.
Step 4: Given the presence of aromatic rings and potential hydrogen bonding sites, this molecule could interact with proteins involved in neurotransmission and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). For instance, the presence of an amine group could interact with GPCRs such as HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A) and HRH1 (histamine receptor 1).
Step 5: Based on the structural features described, the related genes are likely those involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and neurotransmission (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HRH1). These genes encode proteins that are directly involved in the metabolism of the molecule and its interaction with the nervous system.
