Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc2[n-]c(N3CC[NH+](C(=O)C4CCCO4)CC3)nc(=N)c2cc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule contains a quinolone-like structure, which includes a heterocyclic ring system. This type of structure is often associated with drugs that target various receptors and enzymes, such as those involved in neurotransmission and metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of an imidazole ring, which is part of the nitrogen-containing heterocycle, suggests potential interactions with ion channels and receptors. Imidazoles are known to modulate G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which include adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 3: The molecule also features a pyridine ring and a carboxamide group, which are common in compounds targeting cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs). Specifically, CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 are known to metabolize compounds containing these functional groups.
Step 4: The molecule includes a pyrazole ring, which can interact with various targets including serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) and other GPCRs. Serotonin receptors are known to be involved in mood regulation and pain perception.
Step 5: Given the diverse pharmacophoric features, this molecule could potentially interact with multiple genes involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism, including but not limited to: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
