Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOc1ccccc1OCC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure containing a benzene ring, an oxazole ring, and a pyrrole ring. This structure suggests that it might be an inhibitor or activator of enzymes or receptors that interact with these aromatic groups.
Step 2: The presence of a chloro substituent and a carboxamide group (-CONH2) indicates potential interactions with proteins that have hydrophobic and polar binding sites, respectively. This could suggest a relationship with genes encoding for membrane proteins or enzymes that have these types of binding sites.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a nitrophenol group (-OC6H4NO2), which is known to be metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP). This suggests a possible interaction with genes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4.
Step 4: Given the complexity of the molecule, it may also act as a ligand for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to its size and functional groups. This would imply a relationship with genes encoding for GPCRs like HTR2A, HTR2B, and CHRM1.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and potential interactions, the most likely related genes are those involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4) and GPCR signaling pathways (HTR2A, HTR2B, CHRM1).
