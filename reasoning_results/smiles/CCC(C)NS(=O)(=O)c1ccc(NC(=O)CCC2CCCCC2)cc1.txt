Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCC(C)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(NC(=O)CCC2CCCCC2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a benzene ring (C6H6) with a nitro group (-NO2), an amide group (-CONH2), and a pyrrolidine ring. This structure is indicative of a potential inhibitor of enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: Considering the enzyme classes that are known to interact with such structures, we focus on CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4). These enzymes are involved in the metabolism of various drugs and xenobiotics, and their activity can be modulated by compounds with similar chemical structures.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a quinoline-like structure (quinoline-3-carboxylic acid) which could potentially interact with receptors and ion channels. Among the genes listed, those encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ligand-gated ion channels might be relevant. Specifically, this could relate to DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), HTR1A (Serotonin receptor 1A), and KCNH2 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2).
Step 4: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH2) suggests the molecule may have affinity for certain ion channels or transporters. SLC6A4 (solute carrier family 6 member 4) encodes a sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter, which could be influenced by this type of molecule.
Step 5: Based on the structure and functional groups present in the molecule, the related genes are likely to be involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), neurotransmitter signaling (DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), and ion channel modulation (KCNH2).
