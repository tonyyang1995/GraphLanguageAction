Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(-c2cc(C(F)(F)F)nc(SCCC(=O)NCc3ccccc3)n2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system and a quinoline moiety, which are common in many ligands that interact with receptors and enzymes. This structural feature suggests potential interaction with genes encoding for receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of fluoro groups (-F) and a carboxamide group (-CONH2) indicates the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes such as those involved in metabolism, including CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Step 3: The molecule also has a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), which is often found in compounds interacting with ion channels and transporters. This could suggest potential interaction with genes like SLC6A2 and SLC6A4, which encode for neurotransmitter transporters.
Step 4: Given the complexity of the molecule, it may also interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 encode for different subtypes of GPCRs, making them potential targets.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and functional groups, the molecule might also interact with genes encoding enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways, such as PTGS1 (encoding cyclooxygenase-1), which is involved in prostaglandin synthesis.
Summary of related gene names: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, PTGS1.
