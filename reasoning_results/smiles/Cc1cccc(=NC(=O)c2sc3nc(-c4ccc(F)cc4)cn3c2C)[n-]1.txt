Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cccc(=NC(=O)c2sc3nc(-c4ccc(F)cc4)cn3c2C)[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing aromatic rings, a nitrogen atom, and a cyano group (-CN). The presence of a nitrogen atom suggests potential for hydrogen bonding and interactions with proteins that have similar functional groups.
Step 2: The molecule includes a cyano group (-CN), which is known to be involved in various biological processes such as binding to enzymes and receptors. This functional group could interact with proteins that have cytochrome P450 enzyme activity, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are all involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The presence of a nitro group (NO2) in the molecule, although not directly present, can be inferred from the cyano group, might suggest a potential interaction with proteins involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are involved in serotonin receptor signaling.
Step 4: Given the overall structure and functional groups, the molecule might also interact with proteins involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, particularly those related to adrenergic and cholinergic systems, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4. These genes are involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmission, and signaling pathways relevant to the molecule's structure.
