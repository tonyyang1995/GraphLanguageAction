Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCNc1ccc(C(=O)OCC[NH+](C)C)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string CCCCNc1ccc(C(=O)OCC[NH+](C)C)cc1 is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring, a quinoline moiety, and a piperidine ring. It also includes a carboxylic acid group and an amine group with a positive charge. This structure suggests that the molecule may be a ligand or inhibitor targeting receptors or enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: Analyzing the pattern of the molecule, it contains functional groups such as the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and the amine group with a positive charge ([NH+]C), which are typical for molecules interacting with ion channels or receptors. These functional groups could potentially interact with proteins like ion channels (e.g., KCNH2) or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The presence of the quinoline moiety might indicate a potential interaction with enzymes or receptors that have a preference for aromatic rings, such as those involved in neurotransmitter metabolism or signaling. For example, some of the listed genes encode for enzymes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism, including CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which metabolize various neurotransmitters and drugs.
Step 4: Given the positive charge on the amine group and the overall structure, the molecule could act as an agonist or antagonist for receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) or dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4). These receptors play crucial roles in the central nervous system and are involved in various physiological processes, including mood regulation, cognition, and motor control.
Step 5: Considering the potential interactions with ion channels and receptors, the following genes are likely to be related to the molecule: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, KCNH2, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4.
