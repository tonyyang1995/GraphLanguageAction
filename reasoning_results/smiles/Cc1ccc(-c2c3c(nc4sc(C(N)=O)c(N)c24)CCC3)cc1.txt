Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(-c2c3c(nc4sc(C(N)=O)c(N)c24)CCC3)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with multiple functional groups and rings, indicating it likely has pharmacological activity. The presence of a nitro group (-N=O) and amide (-CO-NH-) suggests the molecule could interact with proteins that have binding sites for such functional groups.
Step 2: The molecule contains aromatic rings, which are common in ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature may indicate potential interactions with genes encoding for GPCRs, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, all of which code for receptors that bind to various ligands including neurotransmitters and hormones.
Step 3: The presence of a pyrrole ring in the molecule could suggest interaction with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, like those coded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These cytochrome P450 enzymes play crucial roles in metabolizing many drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 4: The overall structure, particularly the presence of ester and amide bonds, might also imply potential interactions with kinases, such as CDK2, or with receptors that bind to small molecules, like DRD2 and DRD3, both dopamine receptors.
Step 5: Given the complexity and the presence of functional groups that can form hydrogen bonds and other non-covalent interactions, this molecule could potentially interact with a wide range of proteins, including those encoded by the genes listed above, depending on the specific binding sites of these proteins.
