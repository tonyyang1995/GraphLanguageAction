Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCc1cccc(CC)c1-n1c(SCc2cc(=O)n3ccsc3n2)nnc1-c1cccnc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains multiple aromatic rings, including benzene and pyrrole rings, which are common in drug-like molecules and can interact with various receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom within a ring (heteroaromatic) suggests potential interactions with amine-binding sites, such as those found in G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels.
Step 3: The molecule includes a sulfoxide group (-S(O)-), which could modulate enzymes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 involved in phase I metabolism.
Step 4: The overall structure hints at possible interactions with GPCRs, given the presence of amine groups and the overall shape, which could align with binding pockets in these receptors.
Step 5: Given the above structural features, the molecule may be related to genes encoding GPCRs and enzymes involved in drug metabolism, specifically: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, and OPRL1. Step 5: Related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, OPRL1.
