Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CN(C)c1ccc(NC(=O)c2cccc(C(=O)Nc3ccc(N(C)C)cc3)n2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure featuring a central nitrogen atom (N) that is part of an amide group (N-C(=O)-C), which is common in many drugs targeting G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature suggests potential interaction with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The molecule also contains a pyrrole ring system attached to the central nitrogen, which is characteristic of compounds that can modulate the activity of enzymes such as CYP2D6, which metabolizes various drugs including those affecting neurotransmitters.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of aromatic rings and amine groups indicates possible binding to ion channels and receptors, which are targeted by drugs like CACNA1H, which encodes a calcium channel, and SLC6A4, which codes for a sodium-dependent serotonin transporter.
Step 4: The overall structure hints at the molecule's potential to interact with receptors involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction, such as DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2) and HTR2A (serotonin receptor 5-HT2A).
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its likely interactions, the most closely related genes include CYP2D6, CACNA1H, SLC6A4, DRD2, and HTR2A.
