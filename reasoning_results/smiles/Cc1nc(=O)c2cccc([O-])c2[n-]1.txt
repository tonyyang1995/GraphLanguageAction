Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1nc(=O)c2cccc([O-])c2[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string (Cc1nc(=O)c2cccc([O-])c2[n-]1) represents a molecule that is likely a derivative of a heterocyclic compound, specifically an amide with a negatively charged moiety attached to it. This structure is indicative of a small molecule that could potentially interact with ion channels, receptors, or enzymes.
Step 2: Analyzing the structure further, we see a nitrogen atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom (N=O), which suggests the presence of an amide group. Additionally, there are aromatic rings present, which are often involved in binding to protein targets such as receptors or enzymes. The negative charge on the nitrogen indicates a potential for interaction with positively charged sites on proteins.
Step 3: Given the presence of aromatic rings and an amide group, this molecule could potentially interact with proteins that have similar chemical features, such as ion channels or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). These types of proteins often have binding sites that include aromatic residues and can be influenced by the presence of amide groups.
Step 4: Considering the genes listed, several are associated with GPCRs or other receptor families, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and HRH1. Additionally, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 are enzymes that could be affected by this type of molecule due to their role in drug metabolism.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CNR1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, ESR1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KDR, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, PTGS1, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4. 
Summary: Related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CNR1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, ESR1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KDR, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, PTGS1, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4. 
Note: Some genes like ABL1, KDR, and LCK are not typically GPCRs or receptors but are included here based on the broad range of possible interactions suggested by the molecule's structure. However,
