Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COCc1cc(C)n2nc(SC)c(S(=O)(=O)c3ccccc3)c2n1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that includes aromatic rings, heteroatoms (such as nitrogen and sulfur), and functional groups like amide and ester bonds. This structural complexity suggests the molecule could interact with multiple biological targets.
Step 2: Analyzing the potential pharmacological activity of this molecule, we notice it contains an amide group and a sulfonamide moiety. These functional groups are common in drugs that target receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and metabolism.
Step 3: Considering the presence of nitrogen-containing heterocycles and aromatic rings, the molecule might interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or ion channels. Specific receptors that could be targeted include those listed such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are all GPCRs involved in various neurotransmitter systems.
Step 4: The molecule’s structure also hints at possible interactions with enzymes. For instance, the presence of amide and ester functionalities might make it a substrate for enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize drugs. Additionally, the molecule could potentially inhibit or activate certain enzymes like PTGS1, which is involved in prostaglandin synthesis.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule is likely to have relationships with several of the provided genes, including: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, PTGS1.
