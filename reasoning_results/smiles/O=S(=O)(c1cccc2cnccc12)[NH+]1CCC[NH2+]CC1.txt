Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=S(=O)(c1cccc2cnccc12)[NH+]1CCC[NH2+]CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains an oxazolone ring, a sulfonamide group, and an amide linkage, which are characteristic features of many small molecule inhibitors targeting G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels.
Step 2: The presence of a positively charged amino group (NH+) suggests the molecule could interact with ion channels or GPCRs that have binding sites for positively charged molecules.
Step 3: Among the listed genes, several are involved in GPCR signaling pathways and ion channel functions, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CACNA1H, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, KDR, LCK, PTGS1, and SLC6A4.
Step 4: The molecule's structure might allow it to interact with these genes through its positively charged amino group and other functional groups, potentially modulating their activity.
Step 5: The related genes include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CACNA1H, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, KDR, LCK, PTGS1, and SLC6A4.
