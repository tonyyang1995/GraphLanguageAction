Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule containing several functional groups such as amine, imine, ester, and aromatic rings. This structure suggests that the molecule could be involved in interactions with proteins that have binding sites for these functional groups.
Step 2: Analyzing the functional groups further, we see the presence of an amine group (-NH2) and a nitro group (-NO2). These are common motifs in molecules that interact with receptors and enzymes. Specifically, the amine group can form hydrogen bonds, which are crucial for many protein-ligand interactions, while the nitro group can participate in electron-rich interactions.
Step 3: Considering the presence of multiple substituents like fluorine (F) and hydroxyl (O-H), this molecule might have a high affinity for proteins that recognize or bind to such functional groups. For example, it could potentially interact with enzymes that metabolize drugs or neurotransmitters.
Step 4: Given the complexity and the presence of specific functional groups, this molecule could be relevant to genes encoding proteins involved in neurotransmitter signaling, drug metabolism, and receptor binding. Some examples include CYP2D6 (involved in drug metabolism), DRD2 (dopamine receptor), HTR2A (serotonin receptor), and ESR1 (estrogen receptor).
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the following genes are likely to be related: CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A, and ESR1.
