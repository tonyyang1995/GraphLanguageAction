Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCN=c1[n-]nc(-c2ccncc2)s1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups including a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (imidazole), a benzene ring, and a sulfur-containing group (thiol). These features suggest potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for aromatic compounds and heterocycles.
Step 2: The imidazole ring is particularly noteworthy as it is known to interact with various receptors and enzymes, including G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs). GPCRs are involved in signal transduction pathways, while CYPs are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: Among the provided genes, those encoding CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) are directly relevant due to their role in metabolizing xenobiotics, including drugs. The imidazole and thiol functionalities in the molecule could potentially be recognized by these enzymes, leading to metabolic processes.
Step 4: Additionally, several GPCRs are listed, which could interact with the aromatic and heterocyclic parts of the molecule. Notably, HTR2A (serotonin 5-HT2A receptor) and HTR2B (serotonin 5-HT2B receptor) are part of this group. Serotonin receptors play a crucial role in neurotransmission and mood regulation, and molecules with aromatic rings and heterocycles often bind to them.
Step 5: Based on the structural features of the molecule, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B.
Summary of related genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B.
