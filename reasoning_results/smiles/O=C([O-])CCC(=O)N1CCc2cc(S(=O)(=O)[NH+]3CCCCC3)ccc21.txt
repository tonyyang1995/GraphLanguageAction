Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])CCC(=O)N1CCc2cc(S(=O)(=O)[NH+]3CCCCC3)ccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound that includes an aromatic ring system, a carboxamide group, and a heterocyclic amide structure. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes and receptors involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH2) indicates the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes that interact with such functional groups, like CYP (cytochrome P450) enzymes. CYP enzymes are involved in the metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics, making this molecule potentially relevant to CYP-related genes.
Step 3: The heterocyclic amide structure, particularly the presence of a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), points towards potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are often targeted by drugs due to their role in signaling pathways. Among the listed genes, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C are serotonin receptors, which are GPCRs.
Step 4: Given the overall complexity and potential for interaction with multiple targets, the molecule might also interact with kinases. LCK, a tyrosine kinase, and CDK2, a cyclin-dependent kinase, are included in the list of genes. These kinases play crucial roles in cell signaling and regulation.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, LCK, and CDK2. These genes are involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmission, and cell signaling. 
Summary of related gene names: CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, LCK, CDK2.
