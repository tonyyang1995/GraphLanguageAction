Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(CCC[NH+]1CCC(n2c(=O)[n-]c3ccccc32)CC1)c1ccc(F)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule in question is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring with various functional groups such as amide, carbonyl, ester, and alkyl chains. The presence of these functional groups suggests that the molecule could be a drug or a ligand that interacts with specific proteins or receptors.
Step 2: Among the provided genes, several are known to encode for receptors or enzymes that might interact with this type of molecule. For instance, the presence of an amide group could potentially bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are encoded by genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4. Additionally, the presence of a carbonyl group and an ester group could suggest interactions with enzymes encoded by CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: Furthermore, the presence of a benzene ring with alkyl chains might indicate a potential interaction with other receptors or ion channels. Genes encoding for ion channels or receptors that might interact with such a structure include KCNH2 and HTR2A.
Step 4: The molecule also contains a nitro group (-NO2), which could interact with enzymes such as those involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics, like CYP3A4, or with neurotransmitter receptors like HTR1A.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, and LCK.
