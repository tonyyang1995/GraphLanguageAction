Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC[NH+](CC)C(=O)c1ccc(C(=C2CC[NH2+]CC2)c2ccccc2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring, which is characteristic of many ligands for receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4). This structural feature suggests potential interactions with these receptor types.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-CONH-) indicates the molecule could be a ligand for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are known to bind various types of ligands including amides.
Step 3: The benzene rings and their substitution patterns suggest the molecule might interact with enzymes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics due to their ability to oxidize aromatic compounds.
Step 4: The quinoline moiety present in the molecule could indicate potential binding to HTR2A, a serotonin receptor, given that some ligands for this receptor contain similar functional groups.
Step 5: The overall structure and functional groups of the molecule imply it may interact with multiple neurotransmitter systems and drug-metabolizing enzymes, potentially affecting several genes listed, including but not limited to ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, HTR2A, and HTR2B.
