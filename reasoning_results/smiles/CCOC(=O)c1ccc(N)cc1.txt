Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string "CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1" corresponds to N-Acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), a metabolite of paracetamol. The structure includes a benzene ring, an amide group (-CO-N), and an acetyl group attached to nitrogen.
Step 2: The presence of the benzene ring and the amide group suggests that this molecule could interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, particularly those that catalyze reactions involving aromatic rings and amide bonds. This includes cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are encoded by CYP genes such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 3: The acetyl group attached to nitrogen might also suggest potential interactions with cholinergic receptors, given that acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter. Cholinergic receptors are encoded by genes like CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 4: Furthermore, the presence of the amide group could indicate interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as HTR2A, which encodes the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related genes to this molecule are: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and HTR2A.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP1A2
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- CHRM1
- CHRM3
- CHRM4
- HTR2A
These genes are involved in drug metabolism and receptor signaling pathways that may be influenced by NAPQI.
