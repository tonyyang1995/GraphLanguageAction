Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COCCNC(=O)C1CC(c2cccc(OC)c2)=NO1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule, represented by the SMILES string COCCNC(=O)C1CC(c2cccc(OC)c2)=NO1, has a structure that includes a benzene ring, an amide group (-CONH-), and a pyrrole ring. The presence of these functional groups suggests the molecule could interact with proteins that have binding sites for aromatic rings, amides, or other specific functional groups.
Step 2: The benzene ring in the molecule could potentially interact with genes involved in drug metabolism and transport. For example, the CYP (cytochrome P450) family of enzymes, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, are known to metabolize drugs and xenobiotics. They often recognize aromatic substrates, which might include the benzene ring present in this molecule.
Step 3: Additionally, the amide group in the molecule could be relevant to the action of certain neurotransmitters and receptors. Genes like HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A), HTR2B (serotonin receptor 2B), and HTR2C (serotonin receptor 2C) encode for serotonin receptors, which can bind to amide-containing ligands. The amide group in the molecule might also be recognized by kinases or other enzymes that act on amide bonds.
Step 4: The presence of a pyrrole ring, which is a five-membered aromatic ring, might also suggest interactions with genes encoding for enzymes that recognize or modify aromatic compounds. For instance, enzymes like PTGS1 (cyclooxygenase 1) may interact with molecules containing pyrrole rings.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related genes to this molecule are likely to be those involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), neurotransmitter signaling (HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C), and possibly enzymes that interact with aromatic compounds (PTGS1).
