Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C=CC(=O)Nc1cc(N=c2nc(-c3c[nH]c4ccccc34)cc[n-]2)c(OC)cc1N(C)CC[NH+](C)C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure containing a benzene ring system, a pyrrole ring, and a carboxamide group. The presence of a carboxamide group suggests this molecule could be an inhibitor or activator of enzymes that metabolize drugs or hormones, such as those encoded by CYP (Cytochrome P450) genes.
Step 2: The benzene ring system is common in many drugs and can interact with proteins through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. This interaction pattern is relevant to several G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are encoded by genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4. These receptors often have aromatic residues that can form π-π stacking interactions with benzene rings.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a quinolone-like structure, which is characteristic of some ligands for nuclear receptors. Nuclear receptors include those encoded by NR1I3 (PXR) and NR1I2 (CAR), but they are not listed in the provided gene list. However, the quinolone-like structure might suggest potential interactions with other nuclear receptors that are not included here.
Step 4: The presence of a pyrrole ring, which is common in many neurotransmitter agonists and antagonists, could indicate a relationship with neurotransmitter systems. Genes related to these systems include HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, all of which encode serotonin receptors.
Step 5: The molecule's overall structure does not directly suggest a strong relationship with any of the listed genes related to kinases, such as LCK, PTGS1, or KDR, or with genes involved in signal transduction pathways like EGFR or FLT1. However, its ability to bind to proteins through various interactions might influence signaling pathways indirectly.
