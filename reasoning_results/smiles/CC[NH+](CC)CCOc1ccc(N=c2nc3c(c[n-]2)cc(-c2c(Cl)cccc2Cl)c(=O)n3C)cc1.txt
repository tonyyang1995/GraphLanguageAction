Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC[NH+](CC)CCOc1ccc(N=c2nc3c(c[n-]2)cc(-c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl)c(=O)n3C)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has several functional groups including an amide group (-CONH), a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and a pyrrolidine ring. These structural features suggest that the molecule could be a ligand or inhibitor targeting proteins involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: Considering the presence of a carboxylic acid group and a pyrrolidine ring, the molecule may interact with receptors that have acidic or basic amino acid residues in their binding sites. Among the provided genes, the HTR (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) and DRD (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) families are known to contain such receptors.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a benzene ring, which is common in many drugs and can form hydrogen bonds or π-π stacking interactions with aromatic residues in protein binding sites. This structural feature might allow the molecule to bind to kinases like LCK, PTGS1, or MCL1, which contain aromatic residues in their active sites.
Step 4: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) and a chlorine atom (-Cl) suggests the molecule might have electrophilic or nucleophilic reactivity. Such reactive moieties can interact with enzymes containing cysteine residues, potentially affecting the activity of enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP3A4, which are known to be involved in drug metabolism.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions with various protein targets, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, LCK, PTGS1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4.
