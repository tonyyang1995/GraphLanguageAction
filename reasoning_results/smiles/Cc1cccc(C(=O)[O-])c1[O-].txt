Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string (Cc1cccc(C(=O)[O-])c1[O-]) represents a molecule that includes a benzene ring, a carboxyl group (-COOH), and a negatively charged oxygen atom. This structure suggests the molecule could be an organic acid or a derivative thereof.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxyl group indicates the molecule is likely to have acidic properties and can form hydrogen bonds, which may interact with proteins that have ion channels or receptors for acidic compounds. This structural feature points towards potential interactions with genes encoding for ion channels or receptors.
Step 3: The negatively charged oxygen atom might indicate the molecule has an anionic functional group, which could interact with proteins that bind or transport anions. This could suggest possible interactions with genes encoding for anion transporters or receptors.
Step 4: Considering the molecule's acidic nature and its potential to form hydrogen bonds, it may interact with proteins that are involved in signal transduction pathways or neurotransmission. Genes such as those encoding for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or enzymes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism could be relevant.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure, the following genes are potentially related due to their involvement in processes that could be influenced by an acidic compound with hydrogen bonding capabilities: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and PTGS1.
