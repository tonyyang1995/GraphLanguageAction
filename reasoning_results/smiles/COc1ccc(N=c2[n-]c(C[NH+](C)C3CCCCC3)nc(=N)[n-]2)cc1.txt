Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(N=c2[n-]c(C[NH+](C)C3CCCCC3)nc(=N)[n-]2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a quinoline-like core with a nitrogen atom involved in a ring closure and an amide group, suggesting potential interactions with enzymes and receptors that bind to or metabolize such structures.
Step 2: The presence of a substituted benzene ring and a pyridine ring may indicate activity against enzymes like CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: The molecule's structure, particularly the amine and carboxamide functionalities, could interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as DRD2, HTR1A, and HTR2A, which are known to have binding sites for ligands containing similar functional groups.
Step 4: The presence of a pyrrole ring and a nitrogen atom in the molecule might also suggest potential interactions with ion channels, such as KCNH2, which contains a pore-forming domain that could be modulated by molecules with similar nitrogen-containing heterocycles.
Step 5: Given the above structural features, the molecule is most likely related to the genes CYP2D6, CYP2C19, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, and KCNH2, due to their involvement in drug metabolism and receptor signaling.
