Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+]1CCN(C2=[NH+]c3ccccc3Oc3ccc(Cl)cc32)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains several functional groups such as an amide group (-NHCO-), a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH), and a carbonyl group (C=O). These functional groups are characteristic of many pharmacologically active molecules and can interact with proteins that have binding sites for these functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of a positively charged nitrogen atom (-NH+) suggests that the molecule could be a good ligand for receptors or enzymes that have negatively charged binding pockets, such as ion channels, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and other membrane proteins.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a benzene ring system and a pyrrolidine ring, which are common structural motifs in drugs targeting various receptors and enzymes. Benzene rings often participate in hydrogen bonding and π-π stacking interactions, while pyrrolidines can form hydrogen bonds and contribute to the overall conformational flexibility of the molecule.
Step 4: Given the functional groups and structural features described, this molecule might interact with genes encoding proteins involved in neurotransmitter systems, receptor signaling pathways, and drug metabolism. Specifically, it could be relevant to genes encoding GPCRs, ion channels, and enzymes involved in the biosynthesis and metabolism of neurotransmitters.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes include those encoding GPCRs (such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), ion channels (such as KCNH2, KCNQ1, KCNQ2, KCNQ3, KCNQ5, KCNJ2, KCNJ8, KCNJ10, KCNJ11, KCNN2, KCNN3, KCNMA1, KCNA1, KCNA2, KCNA3, KCNA4, KCNA5, KCNA6, KCNA7, KCNA8, KCNA9, KCNB1, KCNB2, KCNC1, KCNC2, KCNC3, KCNC4, KCND1, KCND2, KCND3, KCNE1, KCNE2, KCNE3, KCNE4, KCNE5, KCNE6, KCNE7, KCNE8, KCNE9, KCNE10, KCNE11, KCNE12, KCNE13, KCNE14, KCNE15, KCNE16, KCNE17, KCNE18, KCNE19, KCNE20, KCNE21, KCNE22, KCNE23, KCNE24, KCNE25, KCNE26, KCNE27, KCNE28, KCNE29, KCNE30, KCNE31, KCNE32, KCNE33, KCNE34, KCNE35, KCNE36, KCNE37, KCNE38, KCNE39, KCNE40, KCNE41, KCNE42, KCNE43, KCNE44, KCNE45, KCNE46, KCNE47
