Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(NC(C(=O)c1ccccc1)n1cnccc1=O)c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule, which appears to be a derivative of a benzodiazepine-like structure. Benzodiazepines are known for their ability to interact with GABA receptors, particularly the GABAA receptor, which contains subunits that can be influenced by various genetic factors.
Step 2: The pattern of the molecule includes a central aromatic ring system (likely a benzene ring) connected to other functional groups such as amides, nitriles, and esters. These functional groups can potentially interact with proteins involved in neurotransmission or receptor modulation.
Step 3: Considering the presence of a nitrile group (-CN) and amide groups (-CONH-), this molecule could have potential interactions with enzymes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs and xenobiotics. Additionally, the presence of an ester group (-COOR) suggests possible interactions with metabolic pathways involving CYP3A4.
Step 4: The structure also hints at potential interactions with GABAergic systems, given its benzodiazepine-like characteristics. This would be relevant to genes encoding GABA receptors, such as GABRA1, GABRA2, GABRG2, and GABRD, although these exact genes are not listed in the provided gene list.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, while the molecule does not directly correspond to any of the listed genes, it may have indirect relationships through its functional groups and potential metabolic pathways. However, among the listed genes, those involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmission might be more relevant. Therefore, the related gene names include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. 
Summary of related gene names: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
