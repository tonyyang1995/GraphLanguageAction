Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Nc1ccc(Oc2ccc3nc(-c4ccccc4)c(-c4ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc4)nc3c2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing nitrogen, oxygen, carbon, and other heteroatoms, with a central aromatic ring system. It also includes a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) and a pyrrolidine ring. These structural features suggest potential interactions with enzymes and receptors that are involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction.
Step 2: Considering the pharmacological profile and structure of the molecule, it could potentially interact with several G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are encoded by genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. The presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group and a pyrrolidine ring may enable the molecule to act as an agonist or antagonist at these receptors, depending on its exact chemical properties.
Step 3: The molecule might also interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These enzymes are responsible for metabolizing various drugs, and their activity can influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the molecule.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule could potentially affect signaling pathways mediated by kinases, such as LCK, which is encoded by the LCK gene. The presence of multiple aromatic rings and functional groups suggests that the molecule may be able to modulate kinase activity through direct binding or allosteric inhibition.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and the potential interactions described above, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and LCK.
