Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a tricyclic core with a benzene ring, a furan ring, and an indole ring. This structure is common in many ligands that interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are known to be regulated by various genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a pyridine ring, which can form hydrogen bonds and can interact with acidic residues in the receptor binding site. This feature is relevant to the genes encoding for GPCRs like HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are involved in serotonin signaling.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a quinoline-like structure with a nitrogen atom and a ketone group could indicate potential interactions with enzymes such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics.
Step 4: The molecule has a nitrophenyl group attached to the furan ring, which might suggest potential interactions with genes involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter levels, such as SLC6A2 and SLC6A4, which encode for monoamine transporters.
Step 5: Given the complex structure and potential interactions with multiple receptor sites and metabolic pathways, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes involved in neurotransmission, receptor modulation, and drug metabolism. Specifically, the related gene names include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
