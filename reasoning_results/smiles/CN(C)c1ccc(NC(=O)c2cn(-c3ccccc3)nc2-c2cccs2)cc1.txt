Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CN(C)c1ccc(NC(=O)c2cn(-c3ccccc3)nc2-c2cccs2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring system, which is common in ligands for nuclear receptors and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature is relevant to genes involved in receptor signaling.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrophenol group suggests potential interactions with enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The molecule has a quinoline-like structure, which could interact with proteins such as HTR2A and HTR2C, known to be involved in serotonin signaling.
Step 4: The overall structure includes amine and carboxamide groups, which may engage in binding with cholinergic receptors like CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 5: Given the complex structure and potential for multiple interactions, the molecule is most likely related to several genes including CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2C, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4. 
Summary of related genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2C, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4.
