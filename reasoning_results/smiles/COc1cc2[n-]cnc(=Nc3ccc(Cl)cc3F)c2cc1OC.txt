Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc2[n-]cnc(=Nc3ccc(Cl)cc3F)c2cc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound with a benzene ring system, a nitrogen atom with a negative charge, and a fluorine atom attached to another benzene ring. This structure suggests that the molecule could interact with receptors or enzymes that are involved in neurotransmission or metabolism.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of a nitrogen atom with a negative charge (n-) and a fluorine atom (F) indicates potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which often have negatively charged sites for ligand binding and may contain fluorine substituents. This structural feature is particularly relevant to the genes encoding various GPCRs, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and HRH1.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a cyano group (-CN) and a nitroso group (N=O) in the molecule could suggest potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These enzymes are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics, and their activity can be influenced by the chemical structure of substrates like the given molecule.
Step 4: Furthermore, the molecule's overall structure, with its multiple benzene rings and heteroatoms, might indicate potential interactions with ion channels or transporters. For instance, CACNA1H encodes a calcium channel, and SLC6A4 encodes a sodium-dependent neurotransmitter transporter. These proteins could potentially bind or modulate the function of the given molecule.
Step 5: Based on the analysis of the molecule's structure and its potential interactions with various biological targets, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CACNA1H, and SLC6A4.
