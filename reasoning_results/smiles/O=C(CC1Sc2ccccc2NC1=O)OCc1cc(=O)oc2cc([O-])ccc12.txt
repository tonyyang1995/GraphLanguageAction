Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(CC1Sc2ccccc2NC1=O)OCc1cc(=O)oc2cc([O-])ccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule contains multiple functional groups including an amide (N-C), ester (C-O), and aromatic rings, suggesting it may interact with proteins involved in signal transduction, metabolism, or transport processes.
Step 2: Analyzing the structure, the molecule includes a tricyclic core which is characteristic of certain ligands that can bind to receptors such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This feature suggests potential interaction with genes encoding for GPCRs.
Step 3: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) indicates the molecule could be a substrate for enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Step 4: Considering the overall structure and substituents, the molecule might also interact with ion channels or transporters, which are encoded by genes like KCNH2 and SLC6A4.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, KCNH2, SLC6A4. These genes encode for proteins that are involved in receptor signaling, metabolism, and transport processes. 
Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, KCNH2, SLC6A4.
