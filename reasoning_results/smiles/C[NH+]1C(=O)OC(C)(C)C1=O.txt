Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+]1C(=O)OC(C)(C)C1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this relationship might be clinically significant.
Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string C[NH+]1C(=O)OC(C)(C)C1=O is a derivative of a heterocyclic amine, specifically an imidazole ring substituted with an acetyl group, an amide, and a carboxylate group. This structure indicates the molecule has potential pharmacological activity, particularly in modulating ion channels, receptors, and enzymes due to its amine and carboxylic acid functionalities.
Step 2: The amine group (-NH+) suggests the molecule could interact with receptors that have amine-binding sites, such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), muscarinic cholinergic receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), and dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4). These interactions are possible because the amine group can form hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions with the receptor binding sites.
Step 3: The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) present in the molecule indicates it could also interact with ion channels and transporters, such as the calcium channel CACNA1H, which is involved in voltage-gated calcium channels, and the GABA transporter SLC6A2. The carboxylic acid can form hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions, which are important for binding to these types of proteins.
Step 4: The molecule's structure also includes a benzene ring, which is known to interact with various enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. These enzymes are part of the cytochrome P450 family and play crucial roles in the biotransformation of drugs, meaning the molecule could potentially be metabolized by these enzymes.
Step 5: Considering the above interactions, the related genes to this molecule include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CACNA1H, SLC6A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. These genes encode proteins that could directly interact with the molecule, either through binding or by catalyzing its metabolic transformation. Step 1: The molecule is an imidazole-based compound with an acetyl group, an amide, and a carboxylate group, indicating potential interactions with receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The amine group (-NH+) suggests interaction with adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic cholinergic receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 3: The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) indicates potential interactions with ion channels like CACNA1H and transporters like SLC6A2.
Step 4: The benzene ring suggests possible interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, including CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.
Step 5:
