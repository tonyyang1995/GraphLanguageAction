Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCc1oc2ccccc2c1C(=O)c1cc(I)c(OCC[NH+](CC)CC)c(I)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains multiple aromatic rings and a benzene ring with an amide group (C(=O)c1). This structural feature is often found in ligands that interact with receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of an indole ring (c1oc2ccccc2) suggests potential interaction with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The molecule also includes an imidazole ring (c(I)c(OCC[NH+])c(I)c1), which may indicate a possible interaction with ion channels or other proteins containing imidazole residues.
Step 4: Given the pattern of substituents and functional groups, this molecule could potentially interact with enzymes or receptors involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction, such as those listed under neurotransmitter receptors and enzymes.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, LCK, MCL1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
