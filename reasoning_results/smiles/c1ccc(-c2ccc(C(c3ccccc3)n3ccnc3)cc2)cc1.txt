Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: c1ccc(-c2ccc(C(c3ccccc3)n3ccnc3)cc2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings and functional groups such as benzene rings, heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen), and hydroxyl groups. These features suggest that the molecule may interact with proteins that have similar structural requirements for binding.
Step 2: The presence of a quinoline ring system in the molecule is notable, as it is often found in molecules that bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are involved in signal transduction pathways and are associated with various physiological processes and diseases. Examples of GPCRs include DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), HTR2A (serotonin receptor 5-HT2A), and CHRM1 (cholinergic receptor muscarinic M1).
Step 3: The molecule also contains a pyridine ring, which is another common feature in ligands for enzymes and receptors. Pyridine rings are often found in molecules that interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs), such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These enzymes are involved in the metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics.
Step 4: The molecule's overall structure and functional groups could potentially allow it to interact with ion channels, such as KCNH2 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2) and LCK (lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase), depending on its specific chemical properties and the target's binding site.
Step 5: Based on the analysis of the molecule's structure and potential interactions, the related genes include those encoding GPCRs (DRD2, HTR2A, CHRM1), cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6), and ion channels (KCNH2, LCK).
Summary of related gene names:
- GPCRs: DRD2, HTR2A, CHRM1
- Cytochrome P450 enzymes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6
