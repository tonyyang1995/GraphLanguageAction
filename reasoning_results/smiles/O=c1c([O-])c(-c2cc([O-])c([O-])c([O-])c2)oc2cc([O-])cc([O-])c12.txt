Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure containing multiple oxygen-containing functional groups such as carbonyls (O=C), hydroxyls (O-), and ethers (-O-). This structure suggests that the molecule could be involved in interactions with enzymes or receptors that metabolize or bind to oxygenated compounds.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring system and the overall molecular architecture suggest potential binding sites for proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, particularly those associated with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The molecule contains multiple negatively charged oxygen atoms (-O-), which might interact with positively charged residues in protein binding sites, indicating possible interactions with ion channels or transporters.
Step 4: Considering the above structural features, the molecule could potentially interact with several genes encoding for GPCRs, ion channels, and metabolic enzymes. Specifically, it may have relevance to ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, and CYP2C9.
Step 5: The molecule also shows potential for interaction with genes involved in metabolism and signaling pathways, such as CYP2D6, CYP3A4, PTGS1, and SLC6A4, due to its complex functional group composition.
