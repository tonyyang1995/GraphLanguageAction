Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)OC(C)OC1=C(C(=O)N=c2cccc[n-]2)[NH+](C)S(=O)(=O)c2ccccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system and a sulfonamide group, which are common in drugs targeting various receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a pyridine ring and amide groups suggests potential interactions with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4) and cannabinoid receptor 1 (CNR1).
Step 3: The molecule also has a quinoline ring, which could indicate potential binding to serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), particularly HTR2A due to its aromatic structure.
Step 4: The presence of a pyrimidine ring and carboxylic acid group might suggest interactions with tyrosine kinase receptors (FLT1, KDR) or other enzymes like CYP2D6.
Step 5: Given the overall structure and functional groups, the most likely related genes are: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CNR1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, FLT1, KDR, CYP2D6. 
Summary of Related Genes: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CNR1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, FLT1, KDR, CYP2D6.
