Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COC(=O)c1ccc(-c2n[n-]c(=Nc3ccc(OC(F)(F)Cl)cc3)c3ccccc23)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure containing an aromatic ring system, a carboxamide group (-CO-NH-), and a substituted pyrrole ring. The presence of these structural features suggests that the molecule may interact with proteins involved in signaling pathways, transport, or metabolism.
Step 2: The aromatic ring system could potentially interact with proteins that have hydrophobic binding sites, such as those involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. This is supported by the presence of substituents like fluoro and chlorine, which can form hydrophobic interactions.
Step 3: The carboxamide group (-CO-NH-) is a common functional group found in many drugs and can participate in hydrogen bonding. This feature might allow the molecule to interact with proteins that have charged binding sites, such as ion channels or receptors.
Step 4: The substituted pyrrole ring could be involved in forming π-π stacking interactions with aromatic residues in protein structures, which is relevant for GPCRs and other membrane-bound receptors.
Step 5: Considering the above structural features and their potential interactions with proteins, the molecule is likely to be related to genes encoding proteins involved in GPCR signaling, ion channel function, and possibly drug metabolism. Specifically, this includes ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and SIGMAR1. These genes encode proteins that are known to interact with small molecules and play roles in neurotransmission, hormone signaling, and drug metabolism.

These genes are involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction, neurotransmitter release, and drug metabolism, which are consistent with the structural features of the molecule described. The molecule may act as a ligand or modulator for these proteins. However, without further experimental data, it cannot be definitively stated that the molecule directly interacts with any of these proteins. Further studies would be needed to confirm the interaction and mechanism of action. 
Note: The gene names listed are based on the structural features and potential interactions inferred from the molecule's structure. The actual interactions and mechanisms would need to be confirmed through experimental validation. Other genes not listed here may also be related depending on additional experimental data.
