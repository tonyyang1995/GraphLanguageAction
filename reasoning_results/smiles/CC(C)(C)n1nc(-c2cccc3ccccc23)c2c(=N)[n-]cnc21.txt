Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)(C)n1nc(-c2cccc3ccccc23)c2c(=N)[n-]cnc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a complex structure including aromatic rings, amine groups, and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle. These features suggest potential interactions with receptors that have similar chemical properties, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and nuclear receptors.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-N=) and a pyrrolidine ring indicate possible binding to receptors that recognize these functional groups, such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 3: The nitrogen-containing heterocycle and amine groups could also interact with serotonergic receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), which are known to bind to molecules with similar structures.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP2D6) recognition site suggests potential metabolism pathways involving these enzymes, which are involved in drug metabolism and may affect the activity of several genes, including those related to neurotransmission and receptor function.
Step 5: Based on the structural features, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2D6. 
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2D6.
