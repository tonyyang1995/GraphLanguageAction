Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=Nc1c(-c2c([O-])[n-]c3ccccc23)[nH]c2ccccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that includes a nitroso group (-N=) and an amide group (-CONH-). This structure suggests the molecule may interact with enzymes or receptors that are involved in metabolism or signaling pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring system (c1c(-c2c([O-])[n-]c3ccccc23)) indicates the molecule could potentially bind to or modulate ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors, or other proteins that contain such structures. 
Step 3: Notably, several of the listed genes encode for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), ion channels, and enzymes involved in drug metabolism:
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6: These encode serotonin receptors which are activated by various ligands.
- DRD2, DRD3, DRD4: These encode dopamine receptors.
- CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4: These encode muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.
- CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4: These encode cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
- KCNH2: This encodes a potassium channel subunit.
Step 4: Given the molecular structure's potential to interact with proteins containing nitrogen heterocycles or amide groups, it is likely to have a relationship with the above-listed genes.
Step 5: Therefore, the related genes include: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and KCNH2. 
Summary of related genes: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, KCNH2.
