Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with an amide group attached, which is characteristic of drugs that can interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature suggests potential interactions with genes encoding for GPCRs.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a pyridine ring, which is known to be involved in binding to various enzymes and transporters, particularly those related to metabolism and drug transport. This indicates possible interactions with genes encoding for enzymes and transporters.
Step 3: Given the presence of fluorine atoms and chlorine atoms, the molecule may have specific binding affinities for certain proteins, including transporters and enzymes, which are encoded by genes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, known for their roles in drug metabolism.
Step 4: The molecule’s overall structure, with its amide and aromatic rings, could potentially interact with receptors and ion channels, which are encoded by genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, and CACNA1H, among others.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and functional groups, the most likely related genes are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CACNA1H, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and possibly others involved in metabolism and receptor signaling.
