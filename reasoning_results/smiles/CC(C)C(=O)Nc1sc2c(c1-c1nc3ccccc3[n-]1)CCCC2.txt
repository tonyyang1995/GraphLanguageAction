Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this might be relevant to a particular disease or condition.
Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound with a benzene ring system, a ketone group, and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (a pyrrole ring). These structural features suggest potential interactions with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways and neurotransmission.
Step 2: The presence of a ketone group (-CO-) could indicate the molecule may interact with enzymes that metabolize drugs or other small molecules, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These enzymes are known to metabolize various drugs, including those affecting neurotransmission and signal transduction.
Step 3: The nitrogen-containing heterocycle (pyrrole) and the overall structure suggest possible interactions with receptors or ion channels. For instance, the molecule could potentially bind to adrenergic receptors (such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), cholinergic receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), and GABA receptors (GABRA1, GABRB1, GABRC, which are not listed but could be relevant based on similar structures).
Step 4: The molecule's structure also indicates it might have effects on proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, such as DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), HTR1A (serotonin receptor 1A), and HRH1 (histamine receptor H1). These receptors play roles in neurotransmission and are involved in various physiological processes.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, HTR1A, HRH1.
