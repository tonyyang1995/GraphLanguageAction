Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C1N2CCSC2=[NH+]C1(NS(=O)(=O)c1ccccc1)C(F)(F)F, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule, represented by the SMILES string, contains a nitrogen atom double-bonded to a carbon atom that is part of a benzene ring, indicating it has a nitrile group (-CN). This structural feature is often found in molecules that can interact with enzymes such as CYP (Cytochrome P450) enzymes, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: Additionally, the molecule includes a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), which is known for its ability to form hydrogen bonds and can interact with various proteins, including those involved in neurotransmitter transport and signaling. For example, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 are known to metabolize drugs that contain this functional group.
Step 3: The presence of a quinoline ring system (part of the structure) suggests potential interactions with receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmission and cell signaling pathways. Genes like HTR2A, HTR2B, and CYP2D6 could be influenced due to their roles in serotonin receptor function and metabolism.
Step 4: Furthermore, the molecule’s aromatic rings and functional groups indicate it may have the potential to interact with ion channels or other membrane-bound proteins. This could relate to genes such as KCNH2, which encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and functional groups present in the molecule, it is likely to interact with several genes involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmission, and cell signaling, including CYP2C9, CYP2C19, HTR2A, HTR2B, and KCNH2.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- KCNH2
