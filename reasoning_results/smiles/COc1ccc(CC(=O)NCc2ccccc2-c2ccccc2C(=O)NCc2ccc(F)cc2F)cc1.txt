Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(CC(=O)NCc2ccccc2-c2ccccc2C(=O)NCc2ccc(F)cc2F)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure featuring multiple rings, including a benzene ring with a carboxamide group (-CONH-) and a pyrrole ring fused to it. Additionally, there are substituents such as a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) and a carbamoyl group (-OC(=O)NH-). This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in drug metabolism and transport.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group and a carbamoyl group indicates that this molecule could be an inhibitor or substrate for enzymes involved in the metabolism of drugs. Specifically, the CYP (cytochrome P450) family of enzymes, which includes CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, are known to metabolize molecules containing these functional groups.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a benzene ring, which is a common feature in substrates for various drug-metabolizing enzymes, particularly those in the CYP family. This further supports its potential interaction with the aforementioned CYP enzymes.
Step 4: Given the complex structure and the presence of functional groups that are often recognized by drug transporters, the molecule might interact with ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters like ABCB1, which is responsible for effluxing certain drugs out of cells.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the molecule is likely to have interactions with the following genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, ABCB1.
Note: The other listed genes do not have a direct structural or functional relationship with the described molecule based on the information provided. These genes are associated with various biological processes and pathways but are less relevant to the specific structural features of the given molecule. Therefore, they are not included in the summary of related genes.
