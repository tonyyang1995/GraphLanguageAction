Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cccc(C[NH+]2C(=O)[NH+](C(C)C)C(N(O)C(=O)[NH2+]C(C)C)C2(C)C)c1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a quinoline ring system, which is common in many drugs that interact with receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction. This structural feature suggests potential interactions with genes encoding proteins involved in these processes.
Step 2: The molecule also has a piperidine ring, which is often found in compounds that act as agonists or antagonists for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Given this, it may interact with genes encoding such receptors.
Step 3: Notably, the presence of a pyrrolidine ring and an amide group indicates the molecule could be a ligand for enzymes like CYP2D6, which metabolizes many drugs, including those that interact with neurotransmitter systems.
Step 4: Considering the pattern of the molecule and its likely interactions, it is most closely related to genes encoding neurotransmitter receptors and enzymes involved in drug metabolism. These include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and SLC6A4.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, SLC6A4. 
Note: The molecule does not have direct evidence of interaction with all listed genes, but based on its chemical structure, it is more likely to interact with the neurotransmitter-related and metabolic genes mentioned above. Other genes are less likely to have a direct relationship without further experimental evidence.
