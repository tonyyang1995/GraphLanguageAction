Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccccc1CNC(=O)CCCn1c(=O)c2ccccc2n(CC(=O)NC2CCCC2)c1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is often found in drugs that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are proteins that can be influenced by the presence of ligands such as small molecules. The benzene rings in the molecule could potentially bind to and activate or inhibit these receptors.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a pyridine ring and a carbamate group (-CONH-), which are common functional groups in drugs targeting enzymes like cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. CYP enzymes are involved in the metabolism of many drugs, including those that might interact with the genes listed here. For example, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are known to metabolize various pharmaceuticals.
Step 3: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH-) suggests that this molecule may act as an agonist or antagonist for receptors that have this group as a binding site. Such receptors include dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 4: The molecule’s structure includes a quinolone-like moiety, which is known to interact with certain ion channels and receptors. This could suggest potential interactions with genes encoding ion channels or receptors, such as KCNH2 (a potassium channel) and PTGS1 (which encodes cyclooxygenase-1, involved in prostaglandin synthesis).
Step 5: Based on the above structural features, the molecule could be related to several genes involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6), neurotransmission (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), and ion channel function (KCNH2, PTGS1).
