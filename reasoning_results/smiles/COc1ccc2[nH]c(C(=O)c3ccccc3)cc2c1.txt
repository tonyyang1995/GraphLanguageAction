Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc2[nH]c(C(=O)c3ccccc3)cc2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this might be clinically relevant.
Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string contains a benzene ring with a nitrogen atom bearing a proton (nH), suggesting it has basic properties. This structural feature may interact with receptors that have binding sites for basic molecules, such as adrenergic and cholinergic receptors.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a pyrrole ring system attached to the benzene ring, which is a common pharmacophore in drugs targeting various receptor types, including G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH-) indicates the molecule could act as a reversible inhibitor of enzymes such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which is inhibited by several drugs targeting cholinergic systems.
Step 4: Given the presence of a benzene ring with an amide group and a quaternary ammonium center, the molecule likely interacts with ion channels and transporters. For example, it could bind to GABA-A receptors or nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which are known to have binding sites for molecules with similar structures.
Step 5: Based on the structural features described, the molecule may be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CNR1, CYP2D6, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4. These genes encode receptors and transporters that are involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways mediated by various ligands, including adrenergic, cholinergic, and serotonergic systems. Step 1: ADRA1D
Step 2: ADRA2B
Step 3: ADRB2
Step 4: CHRM1
Step 5: CHRM3
