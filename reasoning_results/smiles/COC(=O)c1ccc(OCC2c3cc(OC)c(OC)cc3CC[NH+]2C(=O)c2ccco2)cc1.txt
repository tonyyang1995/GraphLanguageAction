Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COC(=O)c1ccc(OCC2c3cc(OC)c(OC)cc3CC[NH+]2C(=O)c2ccco2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound that includes a benzene ring, an amide group, and multiple oxygen-containing functional groups. This structure suggests the molecule could be a drug or a ligand that interacts with proteins involved in signaling pathways.
Step 2: Analyzing the structure further, we notice the presence of a pyridine ring (part of the CYP2D6 gene) and multiple aromatic rings, which are common in molecules that interact with enzymes such as cytochrome P450s (CYP enzymes). This indicates potential interactions with CYP2D6, an important enzyme involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a quinolone-like structure, which is characteristic of molecules that might bind to receptors such as the 5-HT2A receptor (HTR2A), known for its role in neurotransmission and mood regulation.
Step 4: Given the presence of a benzene ring and a carbonyl group, the molecule could potentially interact with proteins like HRH1, which has a similar structural motif for ligand binding.
Step 5: Considering the overall complexity and the presence of various functional groups, this molecule could have multiple points of interaction with different proteins. However, based on the specific patterns identified, the most likely related genes are CYP2D6, HTR2A, and HRH1.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2D6, HTR2A, HRH1.
