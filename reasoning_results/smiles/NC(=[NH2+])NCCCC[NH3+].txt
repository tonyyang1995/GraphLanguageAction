Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NC(=[NH2+])NCCCC[NH3+], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string NC(=[NH2+])NCCCC[NH3+] has an amine group (-NH2) that is positively charged due to the presence of a protonated amine group. This structure suggests the molecule could interact with proteins that have binding sites for positively charged amines.
Step 2: The positively charged amine group in the molecule can potentially bind to cation-binding sites on receptors and ion channels. For instance, it might interact with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (such as CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), which have binding sites for choline and acetylcholine, both of which are positively charged at physiological pH.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule's structure may allow it to interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that have binding sites for various ligands, including some that are positively charged. GPCRs such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are involved in dopamine signaling, could be potential targets given the positively charged nature of the molecule.
Step 4: Furthermore, the molecule’s structure may also interact with enzymes that metabolize drugs, such as CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are part of the cytochrome P450 family. These enzymes play a crucial role in drug metabolism, and the molecule's structure could influence their activity.
Step 5: Based on the analysis of the molecule's structure and its potential interactions, the related genes include: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These genes encode proteins that are directly or indirectly involved in the interaction with the positively charged amine group of the molecule. Summary of related gene names: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6.
