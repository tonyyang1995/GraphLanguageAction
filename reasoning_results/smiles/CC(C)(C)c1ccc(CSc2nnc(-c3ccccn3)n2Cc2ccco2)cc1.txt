Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)(C)c1ccc(CSc2nnc(-c3ccccn3)n2Cc2ccco2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a complex structure including aromatic rings, heteroatoms (nitrogen), and a cyclic amine group. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for similar chemical motifs.
Step 2: The cyclic amine and nitrogen-containing heterocycles present in the molecule are common in ligands for receptors and enzymes such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Step 3: Given the presence of a cyclic amine and potential for interaction with receptors, the molecule may be related to GPCRs like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are involved in neurotransmission and are known to bind various small molecules.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure could interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4, which are part of the cytochrome P450 family.
Step 5: The related genes include: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4. Step 5: The related genes include: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4.
