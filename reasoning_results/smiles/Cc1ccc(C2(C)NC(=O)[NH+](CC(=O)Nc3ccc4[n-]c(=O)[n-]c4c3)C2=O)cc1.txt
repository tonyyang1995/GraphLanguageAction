Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(C2(C)NC(=O)[NH+](CC(=O)Nc3ccc4[n-]c(=O)[n-]c4c3)C2=O)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule has a complex structure containing a benzene ring system with multiple substituents including a pyrrolidine ring, an amide group, and a quaternary ammonium salt. This suggests the molecule could have functional groups such as amides, amines, and possibly aromatic regions.
Step 2: Considering the presence of an amide (C(=O)[NH+]) and a quaternary ammonium salt, this molecule likely interacts with proteins that bind to or catalyze reactions involving these functional groups. For instance, it may interact with enzymes that have binding sites for amides or positively charged amines, such as those found in CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs.
Step 3: The benzene rings and amide groups in the molecule suggest potential interactions with receptors or transporters that have binding sites for aromatic compounds or amides. Genes like CYP3A4, which codes for a drug-metabolizing enzyme, might be involved due to its broad substrate specificity and ability to handle various aromatic compounds.
Step 4: Given the complexity of the molecule and its potential interactions with enzymes and receptors, it is plausible that it could also affect neurotransmitter systems. This aligns with the presence of amine groups, which are common in neurotransmitters. Genes related to neurotransmitter receptors and signaling pathways, such as HTR2A (serotonin receptor), might be influenced by the molecule.
Step 5: Based on the molecule’s structure and the described interactions, the related genes include CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, and potentially others involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmission.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- HTR2A
- Others involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmission (e.g., ABCB1, ABL1, etc.) may also be relevant but less directly related based on the given information. Step 5: Summary of related gene names:
- Others involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmission (e.g., ABCB1, ABL1, etc.) may also be relevant but less directly related based on the given information.
