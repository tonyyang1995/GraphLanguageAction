Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a compound known as 4-(methoxycarbonyl)-7-methoxyquinoline-3-carboxylic acid methyl ester, which is a derivative of quinoline. It has a quinoline ring system with a carboxylic acid group and an ester functional group.
Step 2: This molecule is likely to interact with proteins that have binding sites for carboxylic acids or esters, such as certain enzymes or receptors. Notably, the presence of a carboxylic acid group suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways or enzymatic reactions.
Step 3: Among the listed genes, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 are cytochrome P450 enzymes that metabolize drugs and xenobiotics, including compounds with carboxylic acid groups. These enzymes could potentially be involved in the metabolism or detoxification of this molecule.
Step 4: The presence of an ester group in the molecule might also suggest potential interactions with esterases or other hydrolases, such as those encoded by the PON1 gene, although PON1 is not included in the provided list.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and functional groups, the most likely related genes from the given list are CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6. Step 1: The molecule is a compound known as 4-(methoxycarbonyl)-7-methoxyquinoline-3-carboxylic acid methyl ester, which is a derivative of quinoline. It has a quinoline ring system with a carboxylic acid group and an ester functional group.
Step 2: The quinoline ring structure is common in many natural products and pharmaceuticals, often interacting with proteins involved in cellular processes.
Step 3: Given the presence of a carboxylic acid group, the molecule may interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as cytochromes P450. This leads us to consider genes encoding these enzymes.
Step 4: Among the listed genes, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 are cytochrome P450 enzymes that are known to metabolize various compounds, including those with carboxylic acid groups.
Step 5: Therefore, the most relevant genes related to this molecule are CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6. Step 1: The molecule contains a quinoline ring system, which is a common structure in many bioactive compounds.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) suggests the molecule could interact with enzymes involved in metabolism, particularly cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Step 3: Considering the cytochrome P450 family, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 are relevant due to their roles in drug metabolism and xenobiotic detoxification.
Step 4: Est
