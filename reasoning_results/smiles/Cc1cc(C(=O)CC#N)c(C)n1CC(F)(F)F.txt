Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc(C(=O)CC#N)c(C)n1CC(F)(F)F, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring system, which is characteristic of several psychoactive compounds and can interact with receptors involved in neurotransmission.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) and an amide group (C(=O)N) suggests potential interactions with enzymes such as CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a quinoline ring, which may indicate interactions with genes involved in signaling pathways or neurotransmitter receptors.
Step 4: The presence of fluorine atoms (F) in the molecule could suggest potential interactions with ion channels like KCNH2, given that fluorination can modulate channel function.
Step 5: Based on the structural features, the molecule is likely to be related to genes involved in neurotransmission, drug metabolism, and ion channel function, including: CYP2D6, CYP2C19, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2. 
Related Gene Names: CYP2D6, CYP2C19, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2.
