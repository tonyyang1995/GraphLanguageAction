Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1ccc(-c2ccccc2)n[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule with a core structure of a benzene ring (c1ccc) containing a nitrile group (-c2ccccc2n), an amine group (n), and a nitrogen atom with a negative charge ([n-]). This structure suggests that the molecule could be an electrophilic aromatic compound, which often interacts with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: Considering the molecular structure, the presence of a nitrile group and an amine group might indicate potential interactions with enzymes such as CYP2D6 and CYP2C9, which are known to metabolize molecules containing these functional groups. These cytochrome P450 enzymes play a significant role in the biotransformation of many drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: The negative charge on the nitrogen atom might also suggest a potential interaction with transport proteins like SLC6A2 and SLC6A4, which are involved in the uptake and efflux of various compounds across cell membranes. These transporters are crucial for the distribution and clearance of drugs within the body.
Step 4: Given the potential interactions with metabolic enzymes and transporters, it is reasonable to infer that the molecule may have pharmacological effects related to these processes. Therefore, we can consider genes encoding for these enzymes and transporters, such as CYP2D6, CYP2C9, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4, as being potentially related to the molecule.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, SLC6A2, SLC6A4. These genes encode enzymes and transporters that could interact with the described molecule, potentially affecting its metabolism and cellular uptake. 
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2D6
- CYP2C9
- SLC6A2
- SLC6A4
These genes are likely to be involved in the metabolism and transport of the described molecule. Other genes listed do not have a direct structural or functional relationship with the given molecule based on the provided information.
