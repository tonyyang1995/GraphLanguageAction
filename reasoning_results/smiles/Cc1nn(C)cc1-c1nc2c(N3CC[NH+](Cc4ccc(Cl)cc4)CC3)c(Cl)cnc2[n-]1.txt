Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1nn(C)cc1-c1nc2c(N3CC[NH+](Cc4ccc(Cl)cc4)CC3)c(Cl)cnc2[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a complex structure including aromatic rings, amine groups, and a quaternary ammonium group. The presence of these functional groups suggests potential interactions with receptors that have similar chemical moieties.
Step 2: Analyzing the gene list provided, we can identify several genes that encode receptors or enzymes that could interact with the molecule due to their ligand-binding properties. These include DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are dopamine receptors; HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are serotonin receptors; and CYP2D6, which is an enzyme involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The molecule's structure, particularly the amine and quaternary ammonium groups, can potentially bind to the intracellular domains of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as the dopamine and serotonin receptors encoded by the genes mentioned above. This interaction could modulate receptor activity, leading to changes in neurotransmitter signaling.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of aromatic rings and other polar functional groups might allow the molecule to interact with enzymes like CYP2D6, which metabolizes many drugs through oxidation reactions. Such interactions could influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the molecule.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis and the potential for binding to receptors and enzymes, the related genes are: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and CYP2D6.
