Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(Cn2cnc3c(nnn3Cc3ccc(Cl)cc3)c2=O)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that contains a benzene ring with various substituents including a pyrrole ring, a cyano group, an amide group, and a chlorine atom. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism due to its functional groups.
Step 2: Among the given genes, those primarily involved in drug metabolism are CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. These genes encode for cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are key players in the biotransformation of xenobiotics, including drugs.
Step 3: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) in the molecule could indicate a potential interaction with CYP2C19, as this enzyme is known to metabolize compounds containing such functional groups.
Step 4: Additionally, the amide group in the molecule might also be relevant to CYP2D6, which is capable of oxidizing certain amides.
Step 5: Therefore, the molecule is likely to have a relationship with CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, given their involvement in metabolizing similar functional groups.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP1A2
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
