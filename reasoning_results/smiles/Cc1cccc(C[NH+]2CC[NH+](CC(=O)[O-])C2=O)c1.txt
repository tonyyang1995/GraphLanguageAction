Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cccc(C[NH+]2CC[NH+](CC(=O)[O-])C2=O)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule, when visualized, contains a cyclic structure with nitrogen atoms that are positively charged (N+), indicating potential basicity and proton donation capability. This structure is reminiscent of ligands that interact with receptors which have acidic residues for binding.
Step 2: The positively charged nitrogen atoms are connected to aromatic rings and possibly to other functional groups like amides and esters, which are common in ligands that bind to protein targets such as enzymes and receptors.
Step 3: The presence of an amide group (-CONH-) suggests the molecule could be a potential inhibitor or activator of enzymes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism or signaling pathways, given its structural similarity to known modulators of these processes.
Step 4: Given the structure's potential to interact with acidic residues, it is likely to target proteins with acidic domains, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels. GPCRs are often involved in signal transduction pathways mediated by neurotransmitters and hormones, while ion channels play roles in cellular excitability and membrane potential regulation.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure, it is most likely to interact with genes encoding proteins involved in neurotransmission, signal transduction, and ion channel function. Specifically, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, KDR, LCK, OPKR1, and SIGMAR1.

These genes encode proteins that are known to be involved in various aspects of neurotransmission, signal transduction, and cellular signaling pathways. The molecule's structure suggests it may act as a modulator of these proteins, potentially affecting their function and activity. However, without further experimental validation, this is speculative. 
Note: The gene names provided do not directly correspond to the molecule's structure; they are based on the typical interactions of molecules with these gene-encoded proteins. The exact mechanism and specificity would need to be determined through biochemical and pharmacological studies.
