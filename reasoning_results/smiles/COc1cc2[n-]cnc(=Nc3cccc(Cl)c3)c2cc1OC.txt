Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc2[n-]cnc(=Nc3cccc(Cl)c3)c2cc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule contains a tricyclic structure with a nitrogen atom bearing a negative charge (-) in one of the rings. This type of structure often interacts with ion channels and receptors that are involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction.
Step 2: The tricyclic structure is reminiscent of certain antidepressants and antipsychotics, which target various receptors and ion channels, including those associated with the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin. 
Step 3: Among the listed genes, several are involved in neurotransmitter signaling pathways, particularly those related to dopamine (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), serotonin (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), and GABA (GABRA1, GABRB1, GABRG1). The presence of a negatively charged nitrogen within a tricyclic framework suggests potential interaction with these receptors and ion channels.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule may have affinity for enzymes involved in drug metabolism such as CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize many psychoactive drugs and modulators of neurotransmitter systems.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its likely interactions with neurotransmitter systems, the following genes could be related: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
Summary of related genes: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. Step 1: The provided molecule contains a tricyclic structure with a nitrogen atom bearing a negative charge (-) in one of the rings.
Step 2: This type of structure often interacts with ion channels and receptors that are involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction.
Step 3: Several listed genes are involved in neurotransmitter signaling pathways, particularly those related to dopamine (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) and serotonin (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Step 4: The molecule may also interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism such as CYP2D6 and CYP3A4.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure, the following genes could be related: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
Summary of related genes: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. Step 1: The molecule has a tricyclic structure with a negatively charged nitrogen.
Step 2: This structure is typical of molecules that interact with neurotransmitter receptors.
Step 3: Several genes are involved in dopamine and serotonin signaling (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1
