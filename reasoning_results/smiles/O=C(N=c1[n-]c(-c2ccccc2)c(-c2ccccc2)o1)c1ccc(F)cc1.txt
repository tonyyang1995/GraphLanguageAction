Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(N=c1[n-]c(-c2ccccc2)c(-c2ccccc2)o1)c1ccc(F)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples or extra instructions.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring system and a phenyl ring fused to it, which is a common feature in many drugs that interact with receptors and transport proteins. This structural pattern suggests potential interactions with genes encoding for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and drug transporters.
Step 2: The molecule also has a nitro group (-NO2) attached to a nitrogen atom, which is known to modulate receptor activity, particularly in GPCRs. This indicates possible interactions with genes that encode for GPCRs such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 3: The presence of a fluorine atom (-F) in the molecule might influence its pharmacokinetic properties, affecting its absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. This could relate to the function of the gene CYP2D6, which encodes an enzyme involved in the metabolism of various drugs.
Step 4: The overall structure and functional groups suggest that this molecule may have affinity for multiple targets, including ion channels and kinases. However, without more detailed information about the binding sites, it is less likely to be specifically related to kinases like CDK2 or LCK.
Step 5: Given the pattern of functional groups and the types of interactions suggested, the most likely related genes are those involved in neurotransmitter systems and GPCR signaling pathways. These include CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Summary of related gene names: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
