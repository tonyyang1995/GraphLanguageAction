Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(NC(=O)[NH+](Cc2ccco2)C(C)c2ccco2)cc1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings and functional groups including amide, amine, and hydroxyl functionalities. The presence of an amide group (N-C=O) suggests that this molecule could interact with enzymes involved in metabolism or transport processes, such as those encoded by CYP (Cytochrome P450) and SLC (Solute Carrier) families.
Step 2: The amine group (-NH+) indicates potential interactions with receptors or ion channels, particularly those containing histidine residues. This aligns with genes like HTR (HistoRinergic Receptor), which encode serotonin receptors, and KCNH2, which encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel.
Step 3: The hydroxyl group (-OH) in the molecule might participate in hydrogen bonding or other polar interactions, which could be relevant for genes involved in signaling pathways or receptor-ligand interactions. For instance, genes like PTGS1 (encoding COX-1, cyclooxygenase 1) and SIGMAR1 (encoding sigma-1 receptor) could be related due to their roles in inflammation and signaling.
Step 4: The overall structure also hints at possible interactions with enzymes involved in neurotransmitter synthesis or degradation, such as those encoded by CYP2D6, which plays a role in the metabolism of various drugs and neurotransmitters.
Step 5: Based on the chemical structure and functional groups identified, the most likely related genes are: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, PTGS1, SIGMAR1, and KCNH2.
