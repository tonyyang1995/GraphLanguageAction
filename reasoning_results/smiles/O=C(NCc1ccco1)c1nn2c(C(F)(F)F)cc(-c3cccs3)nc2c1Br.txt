Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(NCc1ccco1)c1nn2c(C(F)(F)F)cc(-c3cccs3)nc2c1Br, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple functional groups such as a carbonyl group (O=C), amine (N), aromatic rings (Cc1ccco1), fluorinated phenyl ring (C(F)(F)F), and a bromine atom (Br). These structural features suggest the molecule could interact with proteins involved in various biological processes.
Step 2: The presence of aromatic rings and the bromine atom indicates potential for interactions with membrane proteins and receptors, which are often involved in signal transduction pathways. This could relate to genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other membrane-bound receptors.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a nitrogen atom that could participate in hydrogen bonding and other polar interactions, which might be relevant for proteins that require such interactions for their function, such as ion channels or transporters.
Step 4: Given the complexity and specific functional groups present, the molecule could potentially interact with enzymes or metabolic pathways. For example, it may have affinity for enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP genes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule appears to be related to several genes, including but not limited to: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KDR, LCK, OPRK1, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, and PTGS1. These genes encode receptors, transporters, enzymes, and other proteins that might interact directly or indirectly with the molecule.
