Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring, an amide group, and a pyrrolidine ring. It also has several substituents such as alkyl chains, a sulfoxide group, and a cyano group.
Step 2: Considering the structure and substituents of the molecule, it appears to be a drug-like compound that could interact with receptors or enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways or metabolic processes.
Step 3: The presence of a cyano group and amide group suggests this molecule might have affinity for proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) or ion channels. This indicates potential interactions with genes encoding for receptors like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are known to have cyano or amide-containing ligands.
Step 4: The benzene ring and sulfoxide group suggest the molecule could also interact with enzymes, particularly those involved in phase I metabolism such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize drugs containing aromatic rings and sulfur-containing functional groups.
Step 5: Given the complexity of the molecule and its potential interactions with various biological targets, the most likely related genes include those encoding for GPCRs and enzymes involved in drug metabolism. The related gene names are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
