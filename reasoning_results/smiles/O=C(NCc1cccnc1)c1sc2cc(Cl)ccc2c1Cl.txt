Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(NCc1cccnc1)c1sc2cc(Cl)ccc2c1Cl, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with a nitrile group (-CN) and a cyano group (-CN), which are common in ligands for nuclear receptors such as CYP enzymes. This suggests potential interactions with genes involved in metabolism and drug transport.
Step 2: The presence of a chloroalkyl substituent (Cl) indicates possible interactions with genes involved in signaling pathways, particularly those related to neurotransmitters and receptors.
Step 3: The overall structure includes multiple functional groups that could interact with various receptors and enzymes, including G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels.
Step 4: The molecule’s structure is complex and could potentially modulate several biological processes, but it is most likely to interact with genes encoding enzymes involved in drug metabolism and transporters involved in neurotransmitter reuptake.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure, the most likely related genes are: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4.
Summary of related genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
