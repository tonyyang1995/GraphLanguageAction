Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCC(C=O)NC(=O)C(CC(C)C)NC(=O)OCc1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string CCCCC(C=O)NC(=O)C(CC(C)C)NC(=O)OCc1ccccc1 has a structure that includes multiple benzene rings and a central core with a ketone (C=O) and amide (N-C=O) functionalities. This structure suggests it could be a small molecule drug candidate with potential to interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: Analyzing the gene list provided, several genes are associated with neurotransmitter receptors and signaling pathways, which could potentially interact with a molecule containing amide and ketone groups. For instance, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4 encode for various subtypes of serotonin and dopamine receptors, respectively, which are known to bind small molecules with similar functional groups.
Step 3: The presence of a benzene ring in the molecule might also suggest potential interactions with genes involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, such as HRH1, which encodes the histamine H1 receptor. Benzene rings are common in ligands that bind to GPCRs due to their planar nature and ability to form hydrogen bonds.
Step 4: Considering the molecule’s overall structure, it may also have potential to interact with enzymes like CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics. The presence of a ketone group in the molecule could be a substrate for these cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the related genes to this molecule include: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HRH1, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These genes encode for receptors and enzymes that could potentially interact with the described molecular structure.
