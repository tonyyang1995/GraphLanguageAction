Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc2ncn(-c3cc(OCc4ccccc4C(F)(F)F)c(C(N)=O)s3)c2cc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this relationship might be important.
Step 1: The molecule contains a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH), which is common in ligands that interact with receptors such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This suggests potential interaction with genes encoding GPCRs.
Step 2: The molecule also has a nitrile group (-CN) and an amide group (-CONH-), which could indicate it might bind to enzymes involved in metabolic pathways, such as those encoded by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19.
Step 3: The presence of fluorine atoms (F) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in the molecule indicates it may have pharmacological activity, possibly interacting with ion channels or other proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, which are often regulated by genes like KCNH2.
Step 4: The molecule’s overall structure includes complex aromatic rings and functional groups that could interact with multiple types of receptors and transporters, including those encoded by DRD2, HTR2A, and SLC6A4.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, SLC6A4, and KCNH2.
