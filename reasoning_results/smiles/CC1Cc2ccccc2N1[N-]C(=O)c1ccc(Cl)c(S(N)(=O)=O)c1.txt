Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC1Cc2ccccc2N1[N-]C(=O)c1ccc(Cl)c(S(N)(=O)=O)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple functional groups such as aromatic rings, nitrogen atoms, and sulfur atoms. Notably, it has a heterocyclic ring system (indicated by the "c" characters in the SMILES string) that includes a pyrrole ring and a thiazole ring, which are common in many bioactive compounds.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule suggests it could potentially interact with proteins that have binding sites for amine-containing molecules. This is particularly relevant for genes encoding receptors or transporters that recognize such compounds. For instance, the molecule might interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which often bind small molecules with basic functional groups like amines.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a carboxamide group (-CONH2), which is known to form hydrogen bonds and can be recognized by proteins with catalytic or regulatory functions. This feature is relevant to enzymes and receptors that require hydrogen bond interactions for their function, such as those encoded by genes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism or signaling pathways.
Step 4: Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, the molecule could potentially modulate the activity of several genes involved in neurotransmitter systems, receptor signaling, and metabolic pathways. Specifically, it might affect genes associated with GPCR signaling pathways, such as HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A), HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4 (dopamine receptors).
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule’s ability to interact with enzymes through its carboxamide group might influence genes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These genes encode cytochrome P450 enzymes that are crucial for the biotransformation of xenobiotics and endogenous substances.
Summary of related gene names:
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- DRD2, DRD3, DRD4
- CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6
These genes are involved in neurotransmitter signaling and drug metabolism, which aligns with the molecular features described. Other genes listed may not have a direct interaction based on the provided information about the molecule's structure.
