Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)[NH+]2CCN(c3nc(=NC4CCCC4)c4ccccc4[n-]3)CC2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional analysis or information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a core structure that includes an amide (CC(=O)N) and a sulfonamide (S(=O)(=O)) group. This pattern suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism and signaling pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)) is often associated with compounds that interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly those involved in neurotransmission and hormone binding.
Step 3: The molecule also has a substituted phenyl ring system (c1ccc(S(=O)(=O)[NH+]2CCN(c3nc(=NC4CCCC4)c4ccccc4[n-]3)CC2)cc1), which could indicate a role in modulating ion channels or receptor activity.
Step 4: Considering the potential for interaction with GPCRs and ion channels, the molecule might be related to genes encoding these proteins. Examples include DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and SIGMAR1.
Step 5: Additionally, given the presence of a sulfonamide and amide groups, the molecule could interact with enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Summary of related gene names: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, SIGMAR1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6.
