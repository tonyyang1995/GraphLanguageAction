Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Clc1ccccc1C[NH+]1CCc2sccc2C1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a chlorinated benzene ring and a pyridine ring connected through a central carbon atom. The presence of a positively charged nitrogen (N+) suggests that the molecule has basic properties and could potentially interact with receptors that have acidic groups, such as those found in G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 2: The pattern of the molecule includes aromatic rings and a positively charged amine group, which are common features in ligands that bind to GPCRs. Specifically, this structure resembles the binding pocket of some GPCRs, particularly those that are activated by agonists or modulators.
Step 3: The gene ADRA1D encodes the alpha-1D adrenergic receptor, a GPCR that is activated by catecholamines and other agonists. The structure of the molecule aligns well with the known ligand-binding site of this receptor, suggesting potential interaction and activation.
Step 4: The gene ADRA2B encodes the alpha-2B adrenergic receptor, another GPCR. Although less likely due to the specific structural features, there is still a possibility of interaction if the molecule also binds to this receptor.
Step 5: The gene CYP2D6 encodes a cytochrome P450 enzyme involved in drug metabolism. While the primary function of CYP2D6 is not directly related to the molecule's structure, the molecule might be a substrate for this enzyme, affecting its metabolism in the body.
Summary of related gene names:
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- CYP2D6
The molecule's structure, featuring a positively charged nitrogen and aromatic rings, suggests potential interactions with adrenergic receptors and the possibility of being metabolized by CYP2D6. Therefore, the related genes are ADRA1D, ADRA2B, and CYP2D6. Other genes listed may not have a direct relationship based on the given molecular structure.
