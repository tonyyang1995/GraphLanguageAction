Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C=Cc1cc([O-])cc2nc(-c3ccc([O-])c(F)c3)oc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with double bonds, which is characteristic of many drugs that interact with receptors and enzymes. This structural feature may suggest potential interactions with genes encoding receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The molecule also has a pyrrolidine moiety attached to the benzene ring, which is known to be involved in binding to certain receptor types. This could indicate a relationship with genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The presence of a fluorine atom in the molecule suggests it might have specific pharmacological activities, such as modulating ion channels or enzymes. This could point towards genes like KCNH2 (encoding a potassium channel protein) or CYP enzymes (involved in metabolism).
Step 4: The molecule includes an alcohol group (-OH) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which are functional groups often found in molecules that can act as agonists or antagonists for various receptors. This might imply a connection to genes involved in neurotransmitter signaling pathways, such as HTR (serotonin receptors), DRD (dopamine receptors), or CHRM (cholinergic receptors).
Step 5: Based on the above structural features and functional groups, the molecule appears to be potentially related to genes encoding GPCRs (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), neurotransmitter receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), and enzymes involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Summary of related gene names:
- GPCRs: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4
- Neurotransmitter receptors: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4
- Metabolism-related: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4
Note: The remaining genes listed do not seem to have a direct relationship with the molecule based on its structure and functional groups. However, further analysis would be needed to rule out indirect effects or other mechanisms of action.
