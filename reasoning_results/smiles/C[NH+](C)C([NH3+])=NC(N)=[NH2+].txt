Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+](C)C([NH3+])=NC(N)=[NH2+], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains multiple amine groups (NH2) and positively charged nitrogen atoms (NH+), indicating it has basic properties. These functional groups suggest potential interactions with acidic sites or charged residues in proteins.
Step 2: The presence of an aromatic ring system and a carbonyl group (C=O) in the molecule indicates it could interact with receptors that have binding pockets containing hydrophobic and polar regions, such as those found in G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: Considering the molecular structure, it might interact with receptors like DRD2 (Dopamine D2 receptor), HTR1A (Serotonin 1A receptor), HTR2A (Serotonin 2A receptor), and HTR2B (Serotonin 2B receptor). These receptors are known to bind molecules with similar functional groups and structural features.
Step 4: The molecule also has a potential for interaction with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9 and CYP2D6, due to its basic nature and possible conjugation reactions with these enzymes.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and potential interactions, the related genes are DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These genes encode proteins involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism, which align with the predicted interactions of the molecule. [DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, CYP2C9, CYP2D6] Summary: The molecule is likely to be related to the genes encoding dopamine and serotonin receptors (DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B) and cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2D6). Other genes listed may not have a direct relationship based on the provided information. [DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, CYP2C9, CYP2D6] Related Genes: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, CYP2C9, CYP2D6.
