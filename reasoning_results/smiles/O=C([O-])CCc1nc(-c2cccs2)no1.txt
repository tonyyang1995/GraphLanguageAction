Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])CCc1nc(-c2cccs2)no1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains an oxygenated aromatic ring system with a carbonyl group and a negatively charged oxygen atom, suggesting it may interact with proteins involved in signal transduction or transport processes.
Step 2: The presence of a pyrrole ring and a substituted amine group indicates potential interactions with receptors that have similar functional groups, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The molecule's structure includes a benzene ring, which could interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP genes.
Step 4: The presence of a hydroxyl group and carboxylic acid functionalities suggests the molecule might interact with ion channels or receptors that respond to these functional groups.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure, the most likely related genes are: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, OPNK1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4. These genes encode enzymes involved in drug metabolism and transport proteins that could interact with the molecule's functional groups. Step 5: Related gene names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, OPRK1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
