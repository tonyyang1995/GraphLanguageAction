Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCOc1cccc(CC[NH2+]CC(=O)[NH+](C)C)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings and functional groups, including amine and carboxylate functionalities. This complexity suggests it could interact with proteins that have diverse binding sites and functions.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of an amine group (-NH2) and a carboxylate group (-COOH) indicates potential for binding to receptors or enzymes that contain similar functional groups. Amines and carboxylic acids are common ligands for many proteins, including some G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The presence of a benzene ring and alkyl chains suggests the molecule might be able to form hydrophobic interactions, which is important for binding to membrane-bound receptors such as GPCRs and ion channels. GPCRs are encoded by several genes listed, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 4: The molecule also contains a quinone-like structure, which could potentially interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4.
Step 5: Given the molecule's structure, it is likely to interact with multiple genes involved in neurotransmitter signaling and receptor function, as well as those involved in drug metabolism. Therefore, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP3A4. Step 5: Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP3A4.
