Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COC(=O)C1=CCC[NH+](C)C1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other type of explanation.
Step 1: The molecule is a benzodiazepine derivative, characterized by a benzene ring fused to a diazepine ring, with an amide group at the nitrogen of the diazepine ring and a carboxylic acid group at the adjacent carbon. This structure suggests potential interactions with GABA-A receptors, which are involved in the modulation of neuronal excitability and are targeted by benzodiazepines.
Step 2: GABA-A receptors are associated with several genes listed, including CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes encode for subunits of the GABA-A receptor, and the molecule's benzodiazepine-like structure could interact with these subunits.
Step 3: The molecule also has a phenyl ring and a piperidine moiety, which might contribute to its interaction with other neurotransmitter systems, such as those mediated by adrenergic receptors. Genes encoding for adrenergic receptors include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, and ADRB2.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a carboxylic acid group may indicate potential inhibition of certain enzymes, such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are involved in drug metabolism. This property could be relevant for understanding the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the molecule.
Step 5: The related gene names are: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19. Step 5: List of related gene names: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19.
