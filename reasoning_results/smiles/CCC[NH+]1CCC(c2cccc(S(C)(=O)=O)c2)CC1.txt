Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCC[NH+]1CCC(c2cccc(S(C)(=O)=O)c2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with multiple functional groups including an amine group (-NH+) and a sulfonamide group (-S(C)(=O)=O). This suggests the molecule may interact with proteins that have binding sites for basic or acidic functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring (represented by "c") and a pyridine ring (represented by "N" with no hydrogen explicitly shown) indicates potential interactions with proteins containing aromatic amino acid residues such as tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine. These residues often participate in hydrophobic and π-π stacking interactions.
Step 3: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a methyl group (-CH3) could indicate the molecule has acidic or basic properties, which might allow it to interact with ion channels or transporters. Ion channels and transporters are encoded by genes like KCNH2 (potassium channel, subfamily H, member 2), which encodes a cardiac delayed rectifier potassium channel, and SLC6A2 and SLC6A4 (solute carrier family 6 members 2 and 4), which encode neurotransmitter transporters.
Step 4: Given the presence of a benzene ring and a sulfur-containing group, this molecule could potentially interact with enzymes or receptors that have specific binding sites for aromatic or thiol-containing compounds. Examples include CYP enzymes (cytochrome P450) and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 5: Considering the molecule's structure and the above points, it is most likely to be related to the following genes:
- CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 (cytochrome P450 enzymes)
- KCNH2 (potassium channel)
- SLC6A2, SLC6A4 (neurotransmitter transporters)
Summary of related gene names: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, KCNH2, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
