Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(-c2nc(CSCC(=O)NC3CCCc4ccccc43)c(C)o2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional analysis or explanation beyond what is asked.
Step 1: The molecule contains a core structure with a benzene ring fused to a pyrrole ring, which is characteristic of many drugs that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature suggests potential interaction with GPCRs.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a thiazole ring, which is commonly found in ligands for receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a cyano group (-CN) and a carboxamide group (-CONH2) indicates potential for enzyme inhibition, specifically with enzymes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: The molecule's overall structure and functional groups suggest possible interactions with multiple receptors and enzymes, including but not limited to GPCRs and CYP enzymes.
Step 5: Based on the structural and functional characteristics, the molecule may be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19. 
Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19.
