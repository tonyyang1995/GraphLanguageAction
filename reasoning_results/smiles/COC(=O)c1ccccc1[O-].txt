Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COC(=O)c1ccccc1[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string COC(=O)c1ccccc1[O-] corresponds to the chemical compound 2-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-phenyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-1-benzopyran-4-one, also known as JTV519. This compound has a benzopyran core with substituents including a phenyl group, a chlorine atom, and an ester group.
Step 2: Analyzing the molecular structure, we observe that it contains a benzopyran ring, which is a six-membered aromatic ring fused to a five-membered lactone ring. This structural feature may interact with certain receptors or enzymes due to its size and shape.
Step 3: Considering the presence of a phenyl group, this part of the molecule could potentially interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as adrenergic receptors (e.g., ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (e.g., CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4). These receptors often have binding sites for ligands with similar aromatic structures.
Step 4: The ester group (-COO-) in the molecule might be recognized by enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP (cytochrome P450) genes (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are involved in the biotransformation of drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and potential interactions, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. These genes encode proteins that could directly interact with or be affected by the compound. [ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4] To summarize, the molecule is likely to be related to the genes encoding adrenergic and muscarinic receptors, as well as cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in drug metabolism. Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string COC(=O)c1ccccc1[O-] corresponds to the chemical compound 2-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-phenyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-1-benzopyran-4-one, also known as JTV519. This compound has a benzopyran core with substituents including a phenyl group, a chlorine atom, and an ester group.
Step 2: The benzopyran core of the molecule suggests potential interactions with receptors that have a complementary shape or charge distribution. This includes adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
