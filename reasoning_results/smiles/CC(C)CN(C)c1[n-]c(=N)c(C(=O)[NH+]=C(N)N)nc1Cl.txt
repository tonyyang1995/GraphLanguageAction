Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)CN(C)c1[n-]c(=N)c(C(=O)[NH+]=C(N)N)nc1Cl, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring fused to an imidazole ring, which is characteristic of ligands for several G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature suggests potential interaction with GPCRs.
Step 2: The presence of a quaternary ammonium group and a carboxamide group indicates the molecule could act as a partial agonist or antagonist for certain GPCRs, depending on its binding affinity.
Step 3: The molecule's structure includes a benzene ring and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle, which are common features in ligands for enzymes such as CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: The overall structure, particularly the presence of aromatic rings and amine groups, could suggest interactions with receptors like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are dopamine receptors.
Step 5: Given the structural patterns and potential interactions, the related genes include: ADRB2, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ESR1, PTGS1. 
Related Genes: ADRB2, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ESR1, PTGS1.
