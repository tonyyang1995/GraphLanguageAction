Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N=c1[n-][n-]cc1-c1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc1cc(F)c(S(=O)(=O)Nc2cscn2)cc1Cl, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule containing multiple functional groups such as amide, ester, carbonyl, and aromatic rings. The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) and a sulfonate ester (S(=O)(=O)) suggests this molecule could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways and neurotransmission.
Step 2: The nitro group and aromatic rings might suggest potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4). These enzymes are responsible for metabolizing various drugs and xenobiotics, and their activity can be influenced by the structure of interacting molecules.
Step 3: The presence of a sulfonate ester group (S(=O)(=O)) could indicate a potential interaction with receptors that bind to or are activated by small molecules with similar functional groups, such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are serotonin receptors. These receptors play crucial roles in mood regulation and other neurological functions.
Step 4: The overall structure and functional groups present in the molecule might also suggest interactions with ion channels and transporters, such as those encoded by KCNH2 and SLC6A4. These proteins are involved in the regulation of ion flow across cell membranes and the transport of neurotransmitters, respectively.
Step 5: Given the potential interactions with CYP enzymes, serotonin receptors, ion channels, and transporters, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, KCNH2, and SLC6A4.
Summary of related genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, KCNH2, SLC6A4.
