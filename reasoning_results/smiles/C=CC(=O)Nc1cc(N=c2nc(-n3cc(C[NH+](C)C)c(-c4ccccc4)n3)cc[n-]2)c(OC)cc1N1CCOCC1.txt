Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C=CC(=O)Nc1cc(N=c2nc(-n3cc(C[NH+](C)C)c(-c4ccccc4)n3)cc[n-]2)c(OC)cc1N1CCOCC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a molecule that is structurally similar to a class of drugs known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This structural pattern includes a benzene ring system, a carboxylic acid group, and an amide group, which are common features in NSAIDs like ibuprofen.
Step 2: Among the given genes, several are involved in drug metabolism and transport. For example, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are enzymes involved in the biotransformation of many drugs, including NSAIDs. These enzymes play a crucial role in converting the parent NSAID into more active metabolites.
Step 3: Another gene, SLC6A4, encodes a sodium-dependent neurotransmitter transporter that is involved in the reuptake of various neurotransmitters, including serotonin. NSAIDs can affect the function of this transporter, potentially altering neurotransmitter levels.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule might interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A) and HTR2B (serotonin receptor 2B), which are involved in the regulation of mood, anxiety, and other psychiatric conditions. NSAIDs have been shown to modulate the activity of these receptors indirectly through their anti-inflammatory effects.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and potential interactions, the related genes include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, SLC6A4, HTR2A, and HTR2B. These genes are involved in drug metabolism, transport, and signaling pathways that could be affected by the given molecule. 
Summary of Related Genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, SLC6A4, HTR2A, HTR2B.
