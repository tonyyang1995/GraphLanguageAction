Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc2c(c1C)[NH2+]C(C(=O)[O-])C1CC=CC21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a tricyclic core structure, which is common in several classes of drugs including antidepressants, antipsychotics, and analgesics. This tricyclic pattern suggests that the molecule might interact with receptors involved in neurotransmission or pain modulation.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (C(=O)[O-]) and a carboxylic acid group (C(=O)[O-]) indicates potential for interaction with ion channels or enzymes. Specifically, the amide could be a ligand-binding site for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or other membrane proteins, while the carboxylic acid might influence the molecule’s pharmacokinetic properties, such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME).
Step 3: The molecule also includes a pyrrolidine ring, which is known to be involved in the binding to various receptors, particularly GPCRs. This feature points towards potential interactions with receptors like DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), HTR2A (Serotonin receptor 5-HT2A), and CHRM1 (Cholinergic receptor muscarinic M1), all of which are involved in neurotransmission.
Step 4: Given the presence of multiple functional groups and the overall chemical complexity, the molecule could interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism. For instance, it might be metabolized by enzymes coded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to be involved in the metabolism of many drugs.
Step 5: Considering the structure and functional groups, the molecule may have affinity for ion channels, particularly those coded by KCNH2 (potassium channel subfamily H member 2). This could suggest potential effects on cardiac function, given the role of KCNH2 in cardiac repolarization.
Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2
- HTR2A
- CHRM1
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- KCNH2 Step 5: Considering the structure and functional groups, the molecule may have affinity for ion channels, particularly those coded by KCNH2 (potassium channel subfamily H member 2). This could suggest potential effects on cardiac function, given the role of KCNH2 in cardiac repolarization.
- KCNH2
Note: The molecule's structure and functional groups suggest interactions primarily with neurotransmitter receptors and enzymes involved in drug metabolism. While it does not directly indicate interactions with all listed genes, it is most closely related to genes involved in neurotransmission and cardiac function. Therefore, the summary focuses on the most relevant genes based on the molecule's structure.
