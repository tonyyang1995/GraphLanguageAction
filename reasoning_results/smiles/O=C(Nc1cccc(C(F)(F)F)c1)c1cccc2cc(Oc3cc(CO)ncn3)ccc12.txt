Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Nc1cccc(C(F)(F)F)c1)c1cccc2cc(Oc3cc(CO)ncn3)ccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings, including benzene rings and a pyrrolidine ring. It also contains functional groups such as amide (-CONH-), ester (-COO-), and ether (-O-) bonds. The presence of fluorine atoms (F) and a hydroxyl group (-OH) further characterizes its chemical nature.
Step 2: The molecule's structure suggests potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for aromatic compounds or contain hydrophobic regions to accommodate the benzene rings. This could include receptors and transporters involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways.
Step 3: Considering the presence of an amide group (-CONH-), the molecule might interact with enzymes or receptors that recognize this functional group. Examples include G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) which often bind to amides and other polar molecules.
Step 4: Given the possible interactions with aromatic compounds and the presence of a hydroxyl group, the molecule may be relevant to genes encoding enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Step 5: Additionally, due to the presence of a benzene ring and potential for interaction with neurotransmitter receptors, the molecule could be related to genes encoding various receptors involved in neurotransmission, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
