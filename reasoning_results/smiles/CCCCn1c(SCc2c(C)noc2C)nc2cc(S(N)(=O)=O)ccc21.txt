Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCn1c(SCc2c(C)noc2C)nc2cc(S(N)(=O)=O)ccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound that includes a nitrogen atom (indicated by 'n' in the SMILES string) and a sulfur atom (indicated by 'S' in the SMILES string). The presence of a nitrogen atom suggests it could be involved in binding to proteins with similar functional groups, such as amino acids or nucleotides, which are common in receptor proteins.
Step 2: The molecule also contains a carboxyl group (-COOH), which is a characteristic functional group for many drugs and signaling molecules. This group can form hydrogen bonds with receptors and other molecules, contributing to the molecule's ability to interact with certain proteins.
Step 3: Notably, the molecule has a structure that includes a benzene ring (indicated by 'c' in the SMILES string), which is a common feature in many drug molecules due to its aromatic properties and stability. Benzene rings can participate in π-π stacking interactions with proteins, which can modulate their activity.
Step 4: Given the complexity and the presence of functional groups like the carboxyl group and the benzene ring, this molecule could potentially interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or other membrane-bound receptors. GPCRs are known to be regulated by various ligands, including small molecules with similar structures.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure, the most likely related genes would be those encoding G-protein coupled receptors, enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways, and transcription factors that regulate gene expression in response to chemical signals. Therefore, the related genes include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, among others that might be involved in similar pathways.
