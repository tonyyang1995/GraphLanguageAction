Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Nc1ccc(=NC(=O)c2ccc(C(F)(F)F)cc2)[n-]c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure including a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring system, a carbonyl group, and fluorine substituents. This structure suggests it may be a drug-like compound that interacts with receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of a carbonyl group and the nitrogen heterocycle indicate the molecule could potentially interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs), which are known to metabolize many drugs. CYP enzymes include CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are all listed among the given genes.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a nitrile group (-CN) and amide functionalities, which can suggest interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are involved in various signaling pathways and are targets for many drugs. The genes ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4 are all GPCRs and are included in the provided list.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule’s overall structure hints at potential interactions with ion channels, given the presence of heteroatoms and hydrophobic regions. KCNH2 is a potassium channel gene that could be relevant here.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule appears to have potential interactions with several genes involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and receptor signaling (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, KCNH2).
