Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(=O)NC1(C(F)(F)F)NC(=O)[NH+](C2CCCCC2)C1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a structure that includes a benzene ring with an acetyl group (CC(=O)), a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (N), and a trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F). This structure suggests the molecule could be a derivative of a benzodiazepine-like compound, which often interacts with receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism.
Step 2: Considering the presence of a benzene ring, acetyl group, and the nitrogen heterocycle, this molecule could potentially interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as adrenergic and cholinergic receptors. These receptors are known to have roles in various physiological processes including stress response, cardiovascular function, and neurotransmission.
Step 3: The trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) is a common substituent in drug molecules as it can enhance lipophilicity, improve metabolic stability, and alter receptor binding affinity. This feature suggests the molecule might have specific interactions with certain enzymes or receptors that are sensitive to such modifications.
Step 4: Given the pattern of the molecule and its potential interactions, it is likely to affect the function of several genes involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism. These include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, all of which code for GPCRs.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule's structure may also influence the function of genes involved in drug metabolism pathways, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, due to its ability to modulate enzyme activity through direct binding or allosteric effects.
