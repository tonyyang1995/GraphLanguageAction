Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: c1ccc(-n2cc(C[NH+]3CCN(c4ncccn4)CC3)cn2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples.
Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex molecule with multiple functional groups including nitrogen heterocycles, amides, and aromatic rings. This structure suggests the molecule could potentially interact with receptors or enzymes that have binding sites for similar chemical functionalities.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen heterocycle containing a positively charged amide group (N+), indicates that this molecule might be able to bind to ion channels, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), or enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYPs). These types of interactions are common in molecules targeting neurotransmitter systems and metabolic pathways.
Step 3: Considering the pattern of the molecule, it aligns well with potential binding sites for GPCRs, which are known to have specific binding pockets for ligands with particular structural features such as nitrogen heterocycles and aromatic rings. Examples of genes encoding GPCRs include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocycle and amide groups also suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These enzymes play crucial roles in the biotransformation of many drugs, making them relevant targets for molecules with similar structures.
Step 5: The molecule's structure also hints at possible interactions with ion channels, particularly those that might involve positively charged groups interacting with anionic sites within the channel. This could be relevant to genes encoding ion channels like KCNH2, LCK, and SIGMAR1.
Summary of related gene names:
- ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6
- KCNH2, LCK, SIGMAR1
Note: The summary includes genes that encode GPCRs, enzymes involved in drug metabolism, and ion channels based on the structural characteristics of the molecule described by the SMILES string. The relationships are inferred from the chemical structure and known binding preferences of the targeted proteins. Other genes were not included due to a lack of direct structural evidence from the given SMILES string.
