Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCOc1ccc(OC(=O)c2ccc(Br)o2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is common in many drugs that interact with receptors and transport proteins. This structure may suggest potential interactions with genes encoding for receptors or transporters.
Step 2: The presence of a benzofuran moiety and a carbonyl group could indicate an interaction with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Step 3: The molecule also includes a choline group, which might suggest a potential interaction with cholinergic receptors encoded by genes like CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 4: Given the overall structure, there is a possibility of interaction with G-protein coupled receptors, as seen in HTR2A and HTR2B, due to the presence of aromatic rings and functional groups.
Step 5: Considering the potential interactions with metabolic enzymes and receptors, the related genes are: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR2A, HTR2B. 
Summary of Related Genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR2A, HTR2B.
