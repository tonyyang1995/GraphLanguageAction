Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(OC)c(CCNC(=O)C2CCN(c3nnc(-n4cccc4)s3)CC2)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule has a complex structure with several functional groups including a benzene ring, an alcohol group (-OH), an amide group (-CONH2), and a cyclic amine (N-N). This structure suggests it could interact with proteins that have binding sites for these functional groups.
Step 2: The molecule contains a benzene ring, which is a common feature in many drug molecules. Benzene rings are often recognized by aromatic amino acids like tryptophan and tyrosine, and can also bind to other proteins such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or ion channels. These types of interactions are particularly relevant to neurotransmitter systems and signaling pathways.
Step 3: The presence of an amide group (-CONH2) indicates the molecule might be able to form hydrogen bonds, which are crucial for binding to proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, such as receptors and enzymes. This is especially true for proteins like GPCRs, which typically have hydrophilic pockets where hydrogen bonding can occur.
Step 4: Given the molecular structure, the molecule is likely to interact with GPCRs, enzymes, and ion channels. GPCRs are involved in various physiological processes, including neurotransmission, and are targeted by drugs such as those listed under neurotransmitter-related genes. Enzymes and ion channels are also critical targets for pharmacological intervention.
Step 5: Based on the structural features of the molecule, it is most likely to be related to genes involved in neurotransmission, hormone signaling, and metabolic pathways. Specifically, the related gene names include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, CNR1, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, KDR, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, PTGS1, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4.
