Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(=NC(=O)C2(c3ccc4c(c3)OC(F)(F)O4)CC2)[n-]c1-c1cccc(C(=O)[O-])c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex molecule that includes a core benzene ring (Cc1ccc...c1), a nitro group (-N=C=O), a lactam ring (c1cccc(C=O)[O-]), and several functional groups such as esters (OC(F)(F)O4), amides (C(=O)O), and an amino group ([n-]). This structure suggests the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors.
Step 2: Analyzing the functional groups, the presence of an ester (OC(F)(F)O4) and an amide (C(=O)O) indicates potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism or signaling pathways. For instance, esterases and amidases could be targeted by this molecule, which are often associated with CYP (cytochrome P450) enzymes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 3: The presence of a lactam ring (c1cccc(C=O)[O-]) and a nitrogen atom with a negative charge ([n-]) suggests the molecule might interact with ion channels or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Specifically, it could target receptors like DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), HTR2A (Serotonin receptor 5-HT2A), and CHRM1 (Cholinergic receptor muscarinic M1), all of which have similar structural features involving nitrogen-containing rings and charged functionalities.
Step 4: Considering the overall structure, the molecule’s ability to bind to and modulate enzyme activity or receptor function makes it relevant to genes encoding for proteins involved in signal transduction and drug metabolism, such as CYP enzymes, GPCRs, and ion channels.
Step 5: Based on the detailed analysis, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A, and CHRM1. These genes encode proteins that are directly involved in the metabolism or signaling pathways affected by the described molecular structure. 
Summary of Related Genes:
- CYP1A2
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- DRD2
- HTR2A
- CHRM1 Step 5: Summary of Related Genes:
