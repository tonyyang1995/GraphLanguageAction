Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Nc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)N=c2ccc(Cl)n[n-]2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a core structure that includes a benzene ring (c1ccccc1), which is common in many drug molecules and can interact with various proteins including receptors and enzymes. The presence of a sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)) suggests the molecule could act as an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes such as those involved in metabolism.
Step 2: The molecule also contains a nitrile group (-N=C2ccc(Cl)n[n-]2), which can participate in hydrogen bonding and can be recognized by certain protein structures like GPCRs (G-protein coupled receptors). This feature may indicate potential interactions with receptors such as adrenergic (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic cholinergic (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4) receptors.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule has a quinolone-like structure (Nc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)N), which is often found in compounds that interact with DNA topoisomerases, such as CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). These enzymes are crucial for the metabolism of drugs and may be influenced by the molecule.
Step 4: The presence of a chloride ion (-Cl) attached to the aromatic ring could affect the molecule’s lipophilicity and its ability to cross cell membranes, potentially influencing its interaction with transporters like SLC6A2 and SLC6A4.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to interact with several genes involved in drug metabolism (CYP enzymes), neurotransmitter signaling (adrenergic and muscarinic receptors), and possibly DNA topology (CYP enzymes).
