Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1n[n-]c(C)c1N1C(=O)c2cccc3c(N4CCCCCC4)ccc(c23)C1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex molecule with multiple functional groups including a nitro group (-N[double bond]N), a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and aromatic rings. This structure suggests the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: Analyzing the molecular structure for potential interactions, the presence of a carboxylic acid group indicates it may interact with proteins containing ion channels or receptors that have acidic residues for binding, such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B) and cholinergic receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 3: The nitro group (-N[double bond]N) is known to form strong hydrogen bonds and can act as a potent modulator of enzyme activity. This functional group could potentially interact with enzymes like CYP2D6, which metabolizes many drugs and is involved in drug resistance mechanisms.
Step 4: Considering the overall structure, the molecule might also influence G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to its size and shape. Specifically, it could interact with dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (MCHR1, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 5: Given the detailed structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, MCHR1. These genes encode receptors and enzymes that are directly influenced by the molecule's functional groups and overall structure.
