Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)c1ccccc1Cc1cc(C(=O)Nc2ccc(S(=O)(=O)c3ccccc3C(C)(C)C)cc2)c([O-])c([O-])c1[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with multiple substituents, including a pyridine ring, a thiazole ring, and a pyrrole ring. This complex aromatic structure is characteristic of many ligands that interact with receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH-) and an amide group (-CONR-) suggests potential interactions with proteins that have acidic and basic residues, such as ion channels, receptors, and enzymes.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a sulfonate ester group (-SO2O-) which could indicate its potential to act as a modulator of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or other proteins involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 4: Considering the pattern of substituents and functional groups, this molecule might interact with receptors like DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are known to bind ligands with similar structures due to their role in neurotransmission and signaling.
Step 5: The molecule may also interact with enzymes such as CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, given the presence of functional groups that could be metabolized by these cytochrome P450 enzymes.
