Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC1CC(OC(=O)C(O)c2ccccc2)CC(C)(C)C1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple functional groups such as benzene rings, esters, and alkyl chains. Its structure includes a central benzene ring with various substituents attached, which are characteristic of molecules that interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This suggests potential interactions with genes encoding for GPCRs.
Step 2: The molecule contains an ester group (-COO-) and a hydroxyl group (-OH), both of which can participate in hydrogen bonding and other polar interactions. These functional groups are known to be involved in the binding of ligands to GPCRs, particularly those that act as agonists or antagonists.
Step 3: Given the presence of multiple aromatic rings and potential hydrogen-bonding sites, this molecule could potentially interact with GPCRs that have high affinity for ligands with similar structural features. This interaction would likely involve the extracellular loops and transmembrane domains of the receptor, which are critical for ligand binding and signal transduction.
Step 4: Among the provided genes, several encode GPCRs, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and HRH1. The molecular structure of the given compound suggests it could be a potential agonist or antagonist for these receptors, depending on its exact chemical nature and how well it fits into the binding pocket of the receptor.
Step 5: Based on the structure and functional groups present in the molecule, the related genes are ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and HRH1. These genes encode for G protein-coupled receptors that could potentially interact with the described molecule.
