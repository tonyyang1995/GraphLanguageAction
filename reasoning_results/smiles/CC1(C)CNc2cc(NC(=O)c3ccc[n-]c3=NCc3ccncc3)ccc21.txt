Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC1(C)CNc2cc(NC(=O)c3ccc[n-]c3=NCc3ccncc3)ccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples or extra text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with substituents including a pyridine ring, a quinoline ring, and an imidazole ring. These functional groups are characteristic of drugs that interact with various receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a quinoline ring and a pyridine ring suggests potential interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs.
Step 3: The imidazole ring and amide functionality may indicate interactions with ion channels or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs like HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and DRD2 are known to have imidazole or similar functional groups in their ligands.
Step 4: The overall structure includes nitrogen-containing heterocycles, which are common in ligands for receptors such as HRH1 and CHRM1, which have nitrogen-containing ligand binding sites.
Step 5: The molecule's complex structure with multiple functional groups could also suggest interactions with enzymes like CYP1A2, which metabolizes a wide range of substrates.
Summary of related genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, HRH1, CHRM1.
