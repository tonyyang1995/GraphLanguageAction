Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC[NH+](CC)C(=S)[S-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string CC[NH+](CC)C(=S)[S-] is an N-hydroxy sulfonamide derivative. This structure includes a positively charged nitrogen atom (N+) connected to a benzene ring, a sulfonamide group (-NH-SO2-), and a thiosulfonate group (-S-SO2-). The presence of a positively charged nitrogen suggests that this compound could be an amine or a quaternary ammonium salt.
Step 2: The pattern of the molecule, particularly the positively charged nitrogen and the sulfonamide moiety, indicates that it might interact with proteins involved in ion transport, neurotransmitter signaling, and other biological processes mediated by such functional groups. This is relevant to genes encoding receptors, ion channels, and enzymes that regulate these pathways.
Step 3: Among the listed genes, those directly related to neurotransmitter signaling and receptor function are most likely to interact with this molecule. For example, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 encode various subtypes of serotonin receptors, which often have binding sites for small molecules including amine derivatives. Similarly, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4 encode dopamine receptors, which also have ligand-binding domains.
Step 4: The CYP family of genes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4) are involved in drug metabolism and detoxification. While the direct interaction of this molecule with these enzymes is less likely due to its specific structural features, they may still play a role in the metabolism or clearance of the molecule within the body.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the genes most likely to be related to this molecule are: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
