Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+](C)CCCN1c2ccccc2CCc2ccccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string C[NH+](C)CCCN1c2ccccc2CCc2ccccc21 contains an amine group (-NH2) that has been protonated to form an ammonium ion (-NH3+). This feature suggests potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for basic amino groups.
Step 2: The presence of multiple aromatic rings (indicated by the benzene rings in the SMILES string) and the presence of a positively charged nitrogen atom could indicate this molecule may interact with receptors or transporters that recognize such structures, particularly those involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways or ion channel modulation.
Step 3: Considering the molecular structure, it could potentially interact with genes encoding for GPCRs such as HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HRH1, which are involved in neurotransmission and modulate various physiological processes including mood, pain perception, and inflammation.
Step 4: The molecule might also interact with ion channels like KCNH2, which encodes for a voltage-gated potassium channel, given its aromatic ring system and positive charge.
Step 5: Given the structure, there is a possibility of interaction with enzymes encoded by genes such as CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are involved in drug metabolism and could affect how this molecule is processed within cells.
Summary of related gene names:
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- HRH1
- KCNH2
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4 Step 5: Summary of related gene names:
- CYP3A4
These genes encode proteins that may interact directly with the described molecule due to its structural features.
