Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COC(=O)c1ccccc1NC(=O)c1cc(-c2ccc([O-])cc2)on1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, a pyrrole ring, and an amide group. These structural features suggest that it could be a ligand for receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmission or drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (N=C-O) indicates potential interactions with receptors that have amine binding sites, such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4). These receptors are known to bind various types of ligands, including amides.
Step 3: The molecule also has a quinoline-like structure, which could interact with certain ion channels and transporters. This is relevant to the genes KCNH2 (potassium channel subfamily H member 2) and SLC6A4 (solute carrier family 6 member 4), which encode for potassium channels and a serotonin transporter, respectively.
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule suggests it might inhibit or activate certain enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. These cytochrome P450 enzymes play crucial roles in metabolizing many drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 5: Given the structural complexity and functional groups present, the molecule may also interact with other genes involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode for various subtypes of serotonin receptors.
