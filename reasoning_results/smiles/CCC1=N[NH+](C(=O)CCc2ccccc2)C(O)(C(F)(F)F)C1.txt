Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCC1=N[NH+](C(=O)CCc2ccccc2)C(O)(C(F)(F)F)C1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound with multiple functional groups, including an amide (N=C), a carboxylic acid (C=O), and fluorine substituents (F). These features suggest the molecule could interact with proteins that have binding sites for these chemical moieties.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (N=C) indicates potential interaction with enzymes or receptors that bind amide-containing compounds. This feature is particularly relevant for enzymes like CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize drugs containing amide groups.
Step 3: The carboxylic acid (C=O) group might indicate the molecule could act as an agonist or antagonist for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that have carboxylic acid binding sites, such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are dopamine receptors.
Step 4: The fluorine substituents (F) in the molecule could influence its pharmacokinetic properties and potentially affect the metabolism or transport by enzymes like CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, which are known to be influenced by fluorine-containing substrates.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the genes encoding CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4 due to the presence of amide, carboxylic acid, and fluorine substituent groups.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- DRD2
- DRD3
- DRD4 Step 1: The given molecule contains an amide group (N=C), indicating it could interact with proteins that have amide-binding sites.
