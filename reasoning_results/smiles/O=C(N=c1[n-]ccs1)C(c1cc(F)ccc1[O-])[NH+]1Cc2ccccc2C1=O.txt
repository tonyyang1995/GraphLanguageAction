Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(N=c1[n-]ccs1)C(c1cc(F)ccc1[O-])[NH+]1Cc2ccccc2C1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this might be important.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring system (N=c1[n-]ccs1), which is characteristic of many ligands that interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature suggests potential interaction with genes encoding GPCRs.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrile group (-N=c1[n-]c) and a carboxylate group (O=C(N=c1[n-]ccs1)C(c1cc(F)ccc1[O-])) indicates the molecule could act as a modulator of ion channels or enzymes, possibly interacting with genes like KCNH2 (a potassium channel) or CYP enzymes (cytochrome P450 enzymes).
Step 3: The molecule also includes a quinone-like moiety (C1cc(F)ccc1), which can be recognized by certain receptors such as HTR2A (serotonin receptor) or other GPCRs, suggesting possible interaction with serotonin signaling pathways.
Step 4: Given the complexity of the molecule, including multiple functional groups, it may also interact with multiple enzymes and receptors, potentially affecting a wide range of genes involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmission.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism, including: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and KCNH2.
