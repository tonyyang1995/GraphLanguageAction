Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc2c(c1)c(=O)oc1cc(OCC(=O)[NH+]3CCC(C)CC3)ccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a cyano group (-CN) attached, which is part of the core structure of several drugs that interact with receptors and ion channels. This structural feature suggests potential interactions with genes encoding receptors and ion channels.
Step 2: The molecule has an amide group (-CONH-) and a hydroxyl group (-OH), indicating it could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes such as those involved in drug metabolism. This is relevant to genes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which encode enzymes involved in Phase I metabolism.
Step 3: The presence of a quinoline-like structure and an amide group suggests possible interaction with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Genes such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which encode serotonin receptors, are potential targets.
Step 4: The molecule's structure includes a pyridine ring, which is known to interact with certain receptor types, particularly those involved in neurotransmission. This is relevant to genes like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which encode dopamine receptors.
Step 5: The overall structure of the molecule, with its various functional groups, indicates it could have multiple pharmacological activities, including modulating ion channels and affecting neurotransmission. Genes related to these functions include KCNH2, which encodes a potassium channel, and SIGMAR1, which encodes a sigma receptor.
