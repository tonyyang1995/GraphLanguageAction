Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(CNC(=O)C2CCC[NH+]2C(=O)NCc2ccccc2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that includes a benzene ring system, a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic structure (likely an imidazole or pyridine), and a number of functional groups such as amides, esters, and possibly aromatic rings. The presence of an amide group (-CONH-) and an ester group (-COO-) suggests that this molecule may be involved in interactions with proteins that have binding sites for these functional groups.
Step 2: Given the presence of a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (+NH), this indicates that the molecule could interact with proteins containing negatively charged residues or binding sites for positively charged molecules, which might include ion channels, receptors, or transporters. This feature aligns with the possibility of interaction with genes encoding proteins involved in neurotransmission or ion channel function.
Step 3: The molecule's overall structure, with its aromatic rings and functional groups, is consistent with the potential for binding to enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by genes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 4: Considering the presence of an amide and ester group, the molecule could also potentially interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or other receptor proteins. Genes such as DRD2 (Dopamine Receptor D2), HTR1A (Serotonin Receptor 1A), and HRH1 (Histamine H1 Receptor) encode proteins that are known to bind to amide and ester-containing ligands.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the most likely related genes from the provided list are those involved in neurotransmission, drug metabolism, and receptor binding. These include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR1A, and HRH1.
Summary of Related Gene Names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- DRD2
- HTR1A
- HRH1 Step 1: The provided SMILES string describes a complex molecule featuring multiple functional groups such as amides and esters, along with aromatic rings and a positively charged nitrogen atom.
Step 2: The presence of amides and esters suggests potential interactions with enzymes or receptors that have binding sites for these functional groups, indicating possible involvement in drug metabolism or receptor signaling.
Step 3: The positively charged nitrogen atom in the molecule indicates it could interact with negatively charged residues or binding sites, which is relevant to ion channels or receptors.
Step 4: The overall structure hints at potential interactions with enzymes involved in phase I metabolism, particularly those catalyzed by cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Step 5: Given the molecular features, the most closely related genes are those involved in drug metabolism and receptor signaling, specifically: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR1A
