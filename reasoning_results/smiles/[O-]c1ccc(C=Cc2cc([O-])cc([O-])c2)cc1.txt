Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [O-]c1ccc(C=Cc2cc([O-])cc([O-])c2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains multiple rings, specifically a benzene ring (C6H6) and a five-membered ring (C5H5), which are common in many drugs that interact with receptors and transport proteins. This complex aromatic structure suggests the molecule could potentially bind to proteins involved in signal transduction or drug metabolism.
Step 2: The molecule also has several oxygen atoms (-O-) and negatively charged oxyanions ([O-]), indicating it might be an electrophilic or nucleophilic compound. This type of functional group is often found in molecules that can modulate the activity of enzymes, receptors, or ion channels.
Step 3: Given the presence of a benzene ring and oxygen-containing functional groups, this molecule could interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs), such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize a wide range of xenobiotics and endogenous compounds.
Step 4: The molecule's ability to bind to or modulate the activity of enzymes and receptors suggests potential interactions with genes encoding for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like DRD2, DRD3, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HRH1, as well as ion channels such as KCNH2 and LCK, which are involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways.
Step 5: Considering the molecule's structure and potential interactions with metabolic enzymes and signaling proteins, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, KCNH2, LCK.
