Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CN=c1cc(C[S+](O)c2ccccc2)[n-]c(-c2ccccc2)n1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge and a negatively charged sulfur atom, suggesting it may interact with proteins that have binding sites for charged groups.
Step 2: The presence of a cytosine (C) and a nitrogen (N) within a benzene ring indicates potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 3: The molecule also has a tricyclic structure, which might interact with receptors like DRD2 and DRD3, both dopamine receptors.
Step 4: The aromatic nature of the molecule could potentially bind to ion channels, such as KCNH2, which encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel.
Step 5: The presence of a carboxylate group (-COO-) and a hydroxyl group (-OH) suggests possible interactions with enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways, such as PTGS1, which encodes COX-1 and COX-2.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, KCNH2, PTGS1. Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge and a negatively charged sulfur atom, suggesting it may interact with proteins that have binding sites for charged groups.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, KCNH2, PTGS1.
