Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)Nc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)NCc2ccccc2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with an acetyl group (CO) attached to it, followed by a carboxylic acid (O=C), and a nitrogen atom that is part of an amide group (-CONH). This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism or receptors that recognize similar functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of a sulfur atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom (S(=O)(=O)) indicates the molecule may interact with proteins containing sulfhydryl groups, such as cysteine residues, which are common in receptor proteins and enzymes.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a pyrrole ring system (c1ccc(S(=O)(=O)NCc2ccccc2)), which is characteristic of many ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), including adrenergic and muscarinic receptors, as well as other types of receptors.
Step 4: Given the diverse functional groups present in the molecule, it could potentially interact with multiple genes encoding receptors or enzymes, including those listed for adrenergic and muscarinic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), as well as enzymes involved in drug metabolism like CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.
Step 5: The molecule's structure does not directly suggest strong interactions with genes related to tyrosine kinase activity (like KDR or LCK), hormone receptors without specific functional groups (like HRH1), or other listed genes that do not typically have direct binding sites for molecules with this specific pattern.
Summary of related gene names:
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- ADRB2
- CHRM1
- CHRM3
- CHRM4
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
Note: The summary focuses on genes that might be relevant based on the structural features of the molecule. It is important to verify through experimental data if the molecule indeed interacts with these genes. Other genes listed may still be indirectly related due to metabolic pathways or cellular signaling, but their direct interaction is less likely given the specific molecular pattern described.
