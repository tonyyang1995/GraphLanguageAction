Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc(C(C)(C)C)c([O-])c(C(C)(C)C)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a benzodiazepine derivative, which contains a five-membered heterocyclic ring (a furan ring) fused to a six-membered benzene ring, along with several substituents including methyl groups and an ester group.
Step 2: Benzodiazepines are known for their ability to interact with the GABAA receptor, a ligand-gated ion channel that is crucial for neurotransmission. This receptor is composed of various subunits, and its modulation can lead to effects on multiple signaling pathways.
Step 3: Among the provided genes, several are involved in the regulation of GABAA receptors or related pathways. For instance, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, and CYP2D6 may be indirectly related as they play roles in cellular signaling and metabolism, which could influence the activity of benzodiazepines.
Step 4: Directly related genes include those encoding receptors that might interact with the molecule, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, and HTR2B, which are serotonin receptors that can be affected by benzodiazepines through modulating their activity.
Step 5: Summary of related genes: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2D6.
Summary of related genes: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2D6. Step 1: The given molecule is a benzodiazepine derivative, characterized by a five-membered heterocyclic ring (furan) fused to a six-membered benzene ring, along with several substituents such as methyl groups and an ester group.
Step 2: Benzodiazepines typically interact with the GABAA receptor, a ligand-gated ion channel essential for neurotransmission. This interaction can affect various signaling pathways within cells.
Step 3: Genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, and ABL1 are indirectly related because they are involved in cellular signaling and metabolism, which can influence the activity of benzodiazepines.
Step 4: Directly related genes include HTR1A, HTR2A, and HTR2B, which encode serotonin receptors that can be modulated by benzodiazepines.
Step 5: Summary of related genes: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1.
Summary of related genes: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1.
