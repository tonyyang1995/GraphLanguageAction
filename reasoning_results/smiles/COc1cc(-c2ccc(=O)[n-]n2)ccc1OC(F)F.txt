Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc(-c2ccc(=O)[n-]n2)ccc1OC(F)F, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule in question is a complex organic compound that includes an aromatic ring system, a carbonyl group, and a heterocyclic nitrogen-containing ring. These structural elements suggest that the molecule could interact with enzymes and receptors that are involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: Among the listed genes, those involved in neurotransmitter systems and receptor signaling are more likely to have a direct interaction with this molecule. Specifically, genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes that modulate neurotransmitter levels or receptor function are relevant.
Step 3: The molecule contains a nitrile (-NC) group, which is often found in ligands for certain GPCRs, particularly those involved in the dopaminergic pathway. This suggests potential interactions with genes encoding dopamine receptors, such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are involved in regulating mood and reward.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a benzene ring and a carbonyl group indicates a possible interaction with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs), like CYP2D6, which metabolize many drugs and endogenous substances. This could influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the molecule.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure, the most likely related genes are those encoding dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) and cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2D6). These genes play key roles in neurotransmission and drug metabolism, respectively, making them the most probable targets for this molecule.
Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2
- DRD3
- DRD4
- CYP2D6 Step 5: Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2D6
These genes are the most likely to be directly influenced by the given molecule due to its structural features.
