Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: OCCOCC[NH+]1CC[NH+](C(c2ccccc2)c2ccc(Cl)cc2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that contains several functional groups including amine (NH+), carboxylic acid (COOH), and aromatic rings. These features suggest the molecule could be an organic compound potentially involved in biological processes.
Step 2: Analyzing the structure further, the presence of an amine group (NH+) indicates the molecule might act as a ligand or agonist for receptors that have amino acid binding sites, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This is relevant to genes encoding various receptor proteins.
Step 3: The aromatic rings and carboxylic acid functionalities are characteristic of molecules that can interact with enzymes or transport proteins. This suggests the molecule could influence the activity of enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYP) or transporters like ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, which are encoded by genes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and ABCB1.
Step 4: Given the potential interaction with receptors and enzymes, the molecule may affect signaling pathways mediated by these proteins, which are encoded by genes like DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), HTR1A (serotonin receptor 1A), and ESR1 (estrogen receptor alpha).
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and the specific functional groups, the molecule could interact with multiple genes involved in neurotransmission, hormone signaling, and drug metabolism. Thus, the related genes include: ABCB1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, ESR1, and HTR1A.
Summary of Related Genes: ABCB1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, ESR1, HTR1A.
