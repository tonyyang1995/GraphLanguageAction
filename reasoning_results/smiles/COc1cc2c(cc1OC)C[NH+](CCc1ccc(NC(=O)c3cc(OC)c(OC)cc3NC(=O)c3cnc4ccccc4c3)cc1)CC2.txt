Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc2c(cc1OC)C[NH+](CCc1ccc(NC(=O)c3cc(OC)c(OC)cc3NC(=O)c3cnc4ccccc4c3)cc1)CC2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule, likely a drug-like compound, which contains several functional groups such as amine (N), alcohol (O), and aromatic rings (c). This structure suggests the molecule could interact with proteins that have binding sites for these functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of an amine group (-NH+) indicates the molecule could be an agonist or antagonist for receptors that bind amines, such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4).
Step 3: The aromatic ring system and alcohol groups suggest the molecule might interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways or enzyme activities, like CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are known to metabolize drugs.
Step 4: The overall structure does not directly indicate interactions with genes like ABCB1, ESR1, FLT1, HRH1, PTGS1, or SIGMAR1, as these typically involve specific ligand binding or receptor activation mechanisms that are not clearly indicated by this molecule’s structure alone.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential to interact with amine and alcohol-binding sites, the related genes are primarily those involved in neurotransmitter signaling and drug metabolism. These include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
