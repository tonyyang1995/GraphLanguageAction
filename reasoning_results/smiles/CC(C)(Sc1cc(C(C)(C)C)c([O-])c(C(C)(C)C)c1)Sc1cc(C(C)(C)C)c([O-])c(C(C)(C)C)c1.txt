Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)(Sc1cc(C(C)(C)C)c([O-])c(C(C)(C)C)c1)Sc1cc(C(C)(C)C)c([O-])c(C(C)(C)C)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains multiple benzene rings and alkyl chains, which are common structural elements in many drugs that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This suggests potential interactions with genes encoding for GPCRs.
Step 2: The molecule has several negatively charged oxygen atoms, likely forming ionic bonds or hydrogen bonds with positively charged sites on the receptor proteins. This indicates possible interactions with genes encoding for GPCRs that have ion-binding pockets.
Step 3: The presence of aromatic rings and hydrophobic alkyl chains could allow the molecule to fit into hydrophobic binding pockets of certain enzymes, such as those encoded by CYP2D6, which is involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule may also suggest interactions with genes involved in neurotransmitter systems, given its potential to bind to receptor sites involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is most likely to be related to genes encoding for GPCRs (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) and enzymes involved in drug metabolism (CYP2D6).
