Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1cc(-c2ccccc2)oc2cc([O-])c([O-])c([O-])c12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples or additional unnecessary text.
Step 1: The molecule contains an oxazole ring (O=c1cc(-c2ccccc2)oc2cc([O-])c([O-])c([O-])c12), which suggests it may interact with enzymes that metabolize similar functional groups. This structural feature could be relevant to genes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of multiple negatively charged oxygen atoms (-[O-]) indicates the molecule could act as a ligand for receptors that bind negatively charged molecules. This could potentially interact with genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The aromatic rings (c2ccccc2) suggest the molecule might have affinity for proteins with hydrophobic binding sites, such as those found in membrane transporters and enzymes. This is relevant to genes coding for transporters and enzymes.
Step 4: The overall structure, with its polar and non-polar regions, implies the molecule could be a substrate for drug efflux pumps, such as those encoded by the ABCB1 gene, which encodes P-glycoprotein.
Step 5: Given the potential interactions with receptors and transporters, the molecule could also affect signaling pathways involving GPCRs and neurotransmitter receptors, which are encoded by genes like DRD2, HTR1A, and HTR2A.
