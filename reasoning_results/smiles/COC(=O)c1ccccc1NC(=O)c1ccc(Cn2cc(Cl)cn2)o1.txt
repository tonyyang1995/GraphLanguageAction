Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COC(=O)c1ccccc1NC(=O)c1ccc(Cn2cc(Cl)cn2)o1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure containing a benzene ring fused to an imidazole ring, which is part of the indole moiety. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins that have similar structural motifs or that bind to indole-containing ligands.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH-) and a carbonyl group (-CO-) indicates that the molecule could be a ligand for enzymes or receptors that interact with such functional groups, particularly those involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 3: Given the presence of a nitrogen atom in the indole ring, the molecule might interact with receptors that contain binding sites for basic amino acids or small peptides. Examples include G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are known to bind various ligands including amino acid-derived molecules.
Step 4: The aromatic structure and the presence of a nitrogen atom suggest possible interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs), which metabolize a wide range of xenobiotics and drugs, often through oxidation reactions involving aromatic rings and amine groups.
Step 5: Based on the above structural features, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes encoding receptors and enzymes that interact with indole-containing ligands, amino acid derivatives, and xenobiotics. The related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, and OPNK1.
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, OPRK1. Step 5: Based on the detailed analysis of the molecule's structure and its potential interactions with various biological targets, the related genes are primarily those involved in receptor signaling, neurotransmission, and drug metabolism. These include adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B), tyrosine kinase receptors (ABL1), serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), and enzymes involved in xenobiotic metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). Additionally, genes associated with pain perception (OPRK1) and inflammation (PTGS1) are also relevant due to their involvement in pharmacological responses.
