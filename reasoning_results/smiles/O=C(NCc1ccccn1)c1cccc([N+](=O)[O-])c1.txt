Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(NCc1ccccn1)c1cccc([N+](=O)[O-])c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule is a complex organic compound that contains several functional groups such as an amide (N=C), an ester (C(=O)O), and aromatic rings (c1ccccn1). This structure suggests it could be involved in interactions with proteins that have binding sites for similar functional groups or aromatic regions.
Step 2: The presence of a quinolone-like structure (Cc1ccccn1) indicates potential interactions with enzymes or receptors that recognize quinolone derivatives. This is relevant to several genes that encode drug-metabolizing enzymes or receptors.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a nitrile group (-[N+](=O)[O-]), which is characteristic of certain classes of drugs like some anti-cancer agents and analgesics. This feature might relate to genes involved in the metabolism or response to such drugs.
Step 4: Given the complexity and specific functional groups, this molecule could interact with multiple genes involved in neurotransmitter systems, drug metabolism, and receptor signaling pathways, particularly those related to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule may be related to several genes including CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and DRD2, due to their roles in drug metabolism and receptor function.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- DRD2 Step 1: The provided molecule is a complex organic compound that contains several functional groups such as an amide (N=C), an ester (C(=O)O), and aromatic rings (c1ccccn1).
