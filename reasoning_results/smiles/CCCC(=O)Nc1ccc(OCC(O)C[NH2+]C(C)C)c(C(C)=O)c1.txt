Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCC(=O)Nc1ccc(OCC(O)C[NH2+]C(C)C)c(C(C)=O)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains several functional groups such as amide (-CONH2), carboxylic acid (-COOH), and hydroxyl (-OH). These functional groups are common in molecules that interact with receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group suggests potential interactions with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other membrane proteins. GPCRs are involved in signaling pathways and can be regulated by ligands binding to them.
Step 3: The molecule also has a benzene ring with substituents like alkyl chains and a nitrogen atom with a positive charge. Such structures can interact with ion channels and transporters, which are encoded by genes like SLC6A2 and SLC6A4.
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule resembles some known inhibitors of enzymes such as CYP2D6 and CYP2C9, which are involved in drug metabolism. This indicates the molecule could potentially inhibit these enzymes, affecting their function.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its likely interactions, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, ESR1, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, and CYP3A4.
