Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C1C=CC(=O)c2c1ccc1c2ccc2ccccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings and functional groups such as carbonyl (C=O), amide (-CO-N), and aromatic rings. The presence of a carbonyl group suggests it could be an acyl compound, which often interacts with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: Among the provided genes, several are involved in drug metabolism and transport, including CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. These genes encode enzymes that are part of the cytochrome P450 family, which plays a crucial role in metabolizing many drugs.
Step 3: Additionally, there are genes related to neurotransmitter receptors, such as DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are associated with dopamine and serotonin receptors. The molecule’s potential to interact with neurotransmitter systems is suggested by its complex structure, particularly the presence of amide and aromatic groups that can form hydrogen bonds and π-π stacking interactions with receptor proteins.
Step 4: The molecule also contains a lactam ring, which is characteristic of some ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This feature might suggest interaction with receptors like HRH1 and CHRM1, which have similar binding sites for certain ligands.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and the provided gene list, the most likely related genes are those involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and neurotransmitter signaling (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C).
