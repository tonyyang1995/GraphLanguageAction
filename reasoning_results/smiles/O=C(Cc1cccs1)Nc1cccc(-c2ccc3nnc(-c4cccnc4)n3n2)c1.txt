Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Cc1cccs1)Nc1cccc(-c2ccc3nnc(-c4cccnc4)n3n2)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrile (-CN) group and a pyridine ring, which are characteristic features of molecules that can interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP). This suggests a potential relationship with genes involved in drug metabolism, specifically CYP2C19 and CYP2D6.
Step 2: The molecule also has a quinoline-like structure, which is known to interact with various G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This indicates a possible interaction with genes encoding for GPCRs such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a pyridine ring and an imidazole ring within the molecule may suggest interactions with ion channels or transporters. This could be relevant to genes like KCNH2, which encodes for a potassium channel.
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule includes aromatic rings and heteroatoms, which are typical for compounds that can act as agonists or antagonists for nuclear receptors. This points towards potential interactions with genes such as PPARG, which encodes for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule appears to have relationships with several genes including CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, KCNH2, and PPARG.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, KCNH2, PPARG.
