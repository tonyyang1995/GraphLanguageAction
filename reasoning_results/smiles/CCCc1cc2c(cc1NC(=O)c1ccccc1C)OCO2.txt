Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCc1cc2c(cc1NC(=O)c1ccccc1C)OCO2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups such as amide, ester, and aromatic rings. Notably, it contains an amide group (N=C=O) which suggests potential interactions with enzymes that metabolize drugs containing amide bonds.
Step 2: The presence of an ester group (O=C-O-) indicates the molecule could be recognized by enzymes involved in ester metabolism. This includes enzymes encoded by genes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize various substrates through oxidative reactions including hydroxylation and oxidation of esters.
Step 3: The aromatic ring system, particularly the benzene ring, might interact with receptors or transport proteins encoded by genes involved in neurotransmitter systems or drug transport. For instance, the benzene ring could potentially bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like DRD2, HTR2A, or adrenergic receptors such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, and ADRB2.
Step 4: Given the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), this molecule could also be recognized by enzymes involved in the metabolism of carboxylic acids, which may include genes like CYP3A4, CYP2D6, or CYP1A2.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and functional groups, the molecule could have pharmacological effects on several genes, including those encoding for GPCRs (DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4) and enzymes involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP1A2).
