Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOc1ccccc1NC(=O)C1CCC[NH+](S(=O)(=O)c2ccc(OC)c(C)c2)C1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a carboxamide group (-CONH2), indicating potential interactions with receptors or enzymes that have binding sites for such functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of a quinolone-like structure (quinoline fused to a benzene ring) suggests possible interaction with enzymes like CYP2D6, which metabolizes many drugs including those with this structural feature.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a pyrrolidine ring and a sulfonamide group, which are common in compounds that interact with cholinergic receptors, such as M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 4: The overall structure, particularly the presence of a carboxamide and a quinolone-like structure, indicates potential modulation of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which include dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) and serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: CYP2D6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
