Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(N=c1nc2cccc(-c3ccc(C[NH+]4CCS(=O)(=O)CC4)cc3)n2[n-]1)C1CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to a benzene ring, which is a common pharmacophore for several drug molecules targeting various receptors and enzymes. This structural feature could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways and receptor binding.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) suggests potential for protein-protein interactions or enzyme inhibition, particularly those involving cysteine residues, which are common in many signaling proteins and enzymes.
Step 3: The molecule includes a thioether moiety (-S-) and a sulfoxide group (S(=O)(=O)), which are known to form covalent bonds with cysteine residues in proteins, leading to potential inhibition of certain enzymes like CYP2C19 and CYP2C9.
Step 4: The presence of a quinoline ring system, which is found in the molecule, is associated with the inhibition of certain kinases such as CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, indicating possible interaction with genes encoding these enzymes.
Step 5: Given the molecule's complex structure and functional groups, it may interact with multiple genes involved in signal transduction pathways, neurotransmitter systems, and drug metabolism. Specifically, the related genes include: CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, and SLC6A4.
Summary of related genes: CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, SLC6A4.
