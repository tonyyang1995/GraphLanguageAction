Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)[NH+]2CCc3c(Cl)cccc3C2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a core structure of a benzene ring with a carboxamide group (-CONH) attached to it. This core structure is common in molecules that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are often involved in signaling pathways mediated by neurotransmitters and other small molecules.
Step 2: The molecule also contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) and a pyrrolidine ring, which are known to be involved in interactions with enzymes and receptors, particularly those related to drug metabolism and transport. This suggests the molecule may have pharmacological activity.
Step 3: The presence of a phenyl ring (benzene ring) with a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) and a positively charged amine group ([NH+]) indicates that the molecule could potentially act as an agonist or modulator for certain receptors, including GPCRs, which are known to bind to ligands with similar functional groups.
Step 4: Given the molecular structure and its potential to interact with GPCRs and enzymes involved in drug metabolism, the molecule might be related to genes encoding proteins that are involved in neurotransmission and receptor signaling, such as HTR2A (serotonin 2A receptor), HTR2B (serotonin 2B receptor), HTR2C (serotonin 2C receptor), DRD2 (dopamine D2 receptor), and CHRM1 (muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1).
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule's potential to influence drug metabolism and transport could be linked to genes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which encode enzymes involved in the biotransformation of many drugs.
