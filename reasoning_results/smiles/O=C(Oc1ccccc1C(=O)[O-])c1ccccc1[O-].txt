Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Oc1ccccc1C(=O)[O-])c1ccccc1[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule in question is a complex organic compound, featuring a core structure that includes a carbonyl group (C=O) and an amide linkage (C(=O)N). Additionally, it contains multiple aromatic rings (indicated by benzene-like structures), which are common in drug molecules due to their ability to form stable hydrogen bonds and participate in π-π stacking interactions.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylate group (-COO-) and a hydroxyl group (-OH) in the molecule suggests potential for binding to proteins that interact with acidic or polar functional groups. This could include receptors or enzymes that have similar functional groups in their active sites.
Step 3: Notably, the molecule also has a phenolic group (-OH attached to an aromatic ring) and an amine group (-NH2), which are often involved in binding to ion channels and transporters. These functional groups can form hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions with proteins, particularly those involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways.
Step 4: Given the molecular structure and its functional groups, the molecule may interact with several genes that encode proteins involved in neurotransmitter transport, ion channel function, and signal transduction. These include genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), ion channels, and enzymes involved in metabolic pathways.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the following genes are likely to be related: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
