Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Nc1ccccc1NC(=O)c1ccc(CNC(=O)OCc2cccnc2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a nitrogen atom (N), benzene rings (c1cccc1), and various functional groups such as amide (NC(=O)), ester (C(=O)OC), and hydroxyl (-OH). The presence of these functional groups suggests potential interactions with receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The benzene ring system, particularly when substituted with functional groups like amides and esters, often interacts with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels. This structure could potentially bind to receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 3: Additionally, the amide and ester functionalities might interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). These enzymes play crucial roles in the metabolism and clearance of drugs from the body.
Step 4: The molecule's overall structure and functional groups also suggest it could influence the activity of G protein-coupled receptor-related pathways, possibly affecting neurotransmitter systems and signaling pathways. This could relate to genes involved in dopaminergic signaling (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), serotonin signaling (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), and other neurotransmitter receptors.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6. These genes are involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter systems, drug metabolism, and receptor function.
