Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc(C(=O)NC2CCC[NH2+]C2)cc(OC)c1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a tricyclic structure with a benzene ring fused to a pyrrole ring, which is typical for molecules that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature suggests potential interaction with receptors that have similar binding sites.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-CONH2) and a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) indicates the molecule may act as a ligand or agonist for certain receptors. These functional groups are often found in compounds that bind to and activate GPCRs.
Step 3: Given the presence of the benzene ring and the specific arrangement of atoms, this molecule could potentially interact with receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), and serotonergic receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule’s ability to form hydrogen bonds due to its amide and hydroxyl groups might enable it to bind to ion channels or other proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, such as KCNH2, which is a voltage-gated potassium channel.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is most likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and KCNH2.
