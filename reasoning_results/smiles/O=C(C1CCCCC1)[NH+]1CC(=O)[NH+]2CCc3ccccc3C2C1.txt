Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(C1CCCCC1)[NH+]1CC(=O)[NH+]2CCc3ccccc3C2C1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples or extra instructions.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring system and a pyridine ring system, which are characteristic of certain classes of drugs that interact with receptors and enzymes. This structural feature may suggest potential interactions with genes encoding for receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of amide groups (-CONH2) and a carbonyl group (C=O) indicates the molecule could be an inhibitor or activator of enzymes such as CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize many drugs.
Step 3: The aromatic rings and the presence of multiple nitrogen atoms suggest possible interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HRH1, which have similar structural requirements for ligand binding.
Step 4: The molecule's structure also hints at potential interactions with ion channels, particularly those encoded by KCNH2, which could be influenced by the presence of charged groups and hydrophobic regions.
Step 5: Based on the identified structural features, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HRH1, and KCNH2. Step 5: Summary of related gene names: CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HRH1, KCNH2.
