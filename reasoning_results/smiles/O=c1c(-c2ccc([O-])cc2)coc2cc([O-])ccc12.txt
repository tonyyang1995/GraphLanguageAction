Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1c(-c2ccc([O-])cc2)coc2cc([O-])ccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a molecule that contains a pyrrole ring, an oxetane ring, and a phenolic group. The presence of the phenolic group suggests potential for interactions with proteins that have hydrophobic binding sites or contain aromatic residues, which are common in many receptor and transporter proteins.
Step 2: The molecule also has a carboxylate group (-COO-) attached to the pyrrole ring, which could interact with basic amino acid residues (e.g., Lys, Arg) in protein binding sites. This interaction pattern is often seen in molecules that bind to ion channels, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), and other membrane proteins.
Step 3: Given the structural features of the molecule, it might interact with proteins involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways. For example, it could potentially bind to GPCRs such as HTR2A (serotonin 5-HT2A receptor) and HTR2B (serotonin 5-HT2B receptor), which are known to have hydrophobic binding pockets and can be modulated by molecules containing aromatic and polar functional groups.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule’s carboxylate group could interact with ion channels like KCNH2 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2), which are often targeted by drugs due to their role in neuronal excitability.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structural characteristics, the related genes include those encoding proteins involved in neurotransmission and ion transport, such as HTR2A, HTR2B, KCNH2, and possibly others like DRD2, DRD3, and PTGS1.
Summary of Related Gene Names:
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- KCNH2
- DRD2
- DRD3
- PTGS1
These genes encode proteins that could interact with the described molecular structure, either directly through binding or indirectly through shared signaling pathways.
