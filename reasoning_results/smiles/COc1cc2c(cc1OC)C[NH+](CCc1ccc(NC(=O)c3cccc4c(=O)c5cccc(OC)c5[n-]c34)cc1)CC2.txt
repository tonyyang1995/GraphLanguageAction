Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc2c(cc1OC)C[NH+](CCc1ccc(NC(=O)c3cccc4c(=O)c5cccc(OC)c5[n-]c34)cc1)CC2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with an amide group (CONH+) and multiple heterocycles, including pyrrolidine and piperidine rings. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes that metabolize drugs or neurotransmitters.
Step 2: The presence of a quinoline-like moiety (quinoline is a common motif in CYP substrates) and the amide group indicate possible involvement with CYP enzymes, specifically CYP2D6 and CYP2C9.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a thiazole ring, which could interact with receptors such as HTR2A and HTR2B, which are serotonin receptors.
Step 4: The presence of a pyrrolidine and a piperidine ring may suggest potential interactions with cholinergic receptors like CHRM1 and CHRM3.
Step 5: The molecule's overall structure and functional groups suggest it might be involved in pathways related to CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP3A4), serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2C), and cholinergic receptors (CHRM4).
Related Gene Names: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4
Summary:
The molecule is likely related to several genes involved in drug metabolism (CYP enzymes) and neurotransmission (serotonin and cholinergic receptors). The specific genes include CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
