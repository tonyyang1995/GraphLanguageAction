Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COC(=O)c1cn(NC(=O)c2ccc(F)cc2)c(=O)c2ccccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound, specifically a tetrapeptide containing a benzene ring fused to a pyrrolidine ring, which is further connected to a piperazine ring via an amide bond. This structure suggests that the molecule could potentially interact with proteins involved in neurotransmission or receptor binding due to its amino acid-like nature and presence of amide bonds.
Step 2: Analyzing the pattern of the molecule, it contains functional groups such as amides, which are known to be involved in interactions with receptors like G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly those associated with neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. The presence of aromatic rings (benzene and pyrrolidine) indicates potential for interaction with ion channels or other membrane-bound proteins.
Step 3: Considering the functional groups and structural features of the molecule, it is plausible that the molecule could interact with genes encoding for GPCRs, ion channels, and enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways. This includes genes like DRD2 (Dopamine Receptor D2), HTR1A (Serotonin Receptor 1A), and CYP2D6 (Cytochrome P450 2D6).
Step 4: Additionally, given the presence of amide bonds and aromatic rings, the molecule might also have affinity for genes encoding ion channels and receptors involved in neurotransmission, such as HRH1 (Histamine H1 Receptor) and KCNH2 (Potassium Voltage-Gated Channel Subfamily H Member 2).
Step 5: Based on the analysis, the molecule appears to be related to the following genes: DRD2, HTR1A, CYP2D6, HRH1, and KCNH2.
Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2
- HTR1A
- CYP2D6
- HRH1
- KCNH2 Step 5: Based on the analysis, the molecule appears to be related to the following genes: DRD2, HTR1A, CYP2D6, HRH1, and KCNH2. These genes encode proteins that are likely targets for the molecule due to its structural features and potential interactions with neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways.
