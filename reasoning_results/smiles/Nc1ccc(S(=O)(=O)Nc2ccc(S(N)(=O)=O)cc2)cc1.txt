Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Nc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)Nc2ccc(S(N)(=O)=O)cc2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring system with multiple substituents, including a sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)) and a nitro group (N). This structure suggests it could interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a sulfonyl group indicates potential interaction with CYP enzymes, specifically CYP2C19 and CYP2C9, which are known to metabolize drugs containing this functional group.
Step 3: The nitro group and overall aromatic structure might also indicate potential binding to enzymes like CYP1A2, which metabolizes various xenobiotics and drugs.
Step 4: Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, the molecule could potentially influence receptors such as DRD2 and HTR2A, which are G-protein coupled receptors that can be modulated by various ligands.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes include: CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP1A2, DRD2, HTR2A.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP1A2
- DRD2
- HTR2A Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring system with multiple substituents, including a sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)) and a nitro group (N). This structure suggests it could interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
- HTR2A
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- SLC6A4
Note: CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 are additional CYP enzymes that might interact with the molecule due to their broad substrate specificity, and SLC6A4 is a transporter that could be affected by the molecule's structure. However, these were not explicitly mentioned in the original reasoning and are added for completeness. The initial summary focused on the most likely interactions based on the given information. Step 1:
