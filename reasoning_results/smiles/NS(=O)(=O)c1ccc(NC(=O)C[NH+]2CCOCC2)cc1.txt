Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(NC(=O)C[NH+]2CCOCC2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring fused to an oxazoline ring, which is characteristic of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This structural feature suggests potential interaction with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH-) and a phenyl ring suggest the molecule may interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly those involved in neurotransmission and hormone signaling.
Step 3: The aromatic nitro group (-NO2) could indicate potential inhibition of enzymes such as CYP2E1, which are part of the cytochrome P450 family, and may also interact with kinases like LCK.
Step 4: The presence of a benzene ring and a carbonyl group (-CO-) suggests possible binding to receptors or enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways, such as those modulated by kinases and GPCRs.
Step 5: The molecule's structure and functional groups might interact with genes involved in neurotransmitter systems and hormone regulation, including HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, ESR1, PTGS1, and SIGMAR1.
