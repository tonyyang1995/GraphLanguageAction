Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(C(=O)N=c2[n-]c(=O)c3cc(OC)c(OC)cc3[n-]2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex molecule with multiple functional groups including an amide, a benzene ring, and several nitrogen-containing heterocycles. This structure suggests that the molecule could potentially interact with proteins involved in neurotransmission, hormone regulation, or signaling pathways due to its diverse functional groups.
Step 2: Analyzing the pattern of the molecule, it contains a benzene ring system which is often found in ligands for receptors such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are known to be associated with various genes listed, including DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode for dopamine and serotonin receptors respectively.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of amide and ester functionalities indicates potential interactions with enzymes or receptors that have binding sites for these functional groups. For example, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 are cytochrome P450 enzymes that metabolize drugs and xenobiotics, and they might interact with this molecule.
Step 4: The molecule also has a quinolone-like structure, which is similar to molecules that can modulate calcium channels, such as those encoded by CACNA1H. Calcium channels play roles in neuronal excitability and neurotransmitter release, making them relevant to neurotransmission-related genes.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and the presence of aromatic rings, nitrogen-containing heterocycles, and amides, the molecule is most likely to be related to genes encoding neurotransmitter receptors and enzymes involved in drug metabolism, specifically: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CACNA1H. 
Summary of Related Genes:
- DRD2, DRD3, DRD4
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19
- CACNA1H
These genes are primarily involved in neurotransmission, hormone regulation, and drug metabolism, which aligns with the structural features of the given molecule.
