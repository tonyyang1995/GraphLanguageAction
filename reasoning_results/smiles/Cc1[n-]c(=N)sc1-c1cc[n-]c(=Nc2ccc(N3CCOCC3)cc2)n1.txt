Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1[n-]c(=N)sc1-c1cc[n-]c(=Nc2ccc(N3CCOCC3)cc2)n1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule containing nitrogen heterocycles, aromatic rings, and functional groups such as amides, esters, and a nitro group. The presence of multiple nitrogen atoms and aromatic rings suggests potential interactions with receptors and enzymes that have similar chemical features.
Step 2: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring system, which is characteristic of compounds that can act as partial agonists or antagonists for various G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature aligns with the known mechanisms of action for several of the listed genes, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, all of which are GPCRs involved in neurotransmission.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a phenylacetylamide moiety, which is known to interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2D6, a key enzyme in drug metabolism. This interaction could affect the pharmacokinetics of the molecule, impacting its clearance and bioavailability.
Step 4: The nitro group in the molecule may also influence its binding affinity to certain enzymes or receptors. For example, nitro groups can be recognized by proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, potentially modulating the activity of kinases like LCK and HRH1, which are present in the list.
Step 5: Given the above structural and functional characteristics, the molecule is most likely to be related to the genes ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2D6, LCK, and HRH1, as they share chemical and biological properties that allow for potential interactions with this complex organic compound.
