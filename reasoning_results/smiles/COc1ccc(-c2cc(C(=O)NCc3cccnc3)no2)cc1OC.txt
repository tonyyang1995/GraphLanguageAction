Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(-c2cc(C(=O)NCc3cccnc3)no2)cc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with an attached pyrrole ring, indicating potential interaction with enzymes involved in phase I metabolism such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. This suggests a possible relationship with CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a nitrile group (-CN) and a carboxamide group (-CONH2), which are known to interact with certain receptors and transport proteins. These functional groups could potentially interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C.
Step 3: The presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) might indicate potential activity against kinases or other proteins that interact with such functional groups. This could relate to genes such as KDR, LCK, and PTGS1.
Step 4: The overall structure, particularly the presence of aromatic rings and heteroatoms, may suggest interactions with ion channels, such as KCNH2, or with nuclear receptors like PPARG.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, KDR, LCK, PTGS1, KCNH2, PPARG. Step 5: Summary of Related Gene Names: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, KDR, LCK, PTGS1, KCNH2, PPARG.
