Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC1CC[NH+](S(=O)(=O)c2ccc(NC(=O)Cc3ccccc3)cc2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule, which appears to be a derivative of a benzene ring system with multiple functional groups such as amide, carboxylate, and sulfonyl. This structure suggests that the molecule could have diverse biological activities due to its chemical diversity.
Step 2: Given the presence of a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) and an amide group (-CONH-), this molecule might interact with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C19 and CYP2D6. These enzymes are known to metabolize drugs and other xenobiotics, and the molecule’s structure indicates potential interactions with these pathways.
Step 3: The molecule contains a quaternary ammonium group ([NH+]), which could indicate a role in signaling pathways or receptor binding. This feature may relate to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are encoded by genes such as DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C. These receptors are known for their roles in neurotransmission and are often targets for psychiatric and neurological drugs.
Step 4: The presence of a carboxylate group (-COO-) suggests the molecule could interact with ion channels or transporters. For example, the CACNA1H gene encodes a calcium channel, and the SLC6A2 and SLC6A4 genes encode sodium-dependent neurotransmitter transporters, which could be potential targets for this molecule.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmission, and ion channel function. The related gene names include:
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- DRD2
- DRD3
- DRD4
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- CACNA1H
- SLC6A2
- SLC6A4
These genes play crucial roles in various physiological processes and are often targeted by pharmaceuticals, making them relevant to the potential biological activity of the described molecule.
