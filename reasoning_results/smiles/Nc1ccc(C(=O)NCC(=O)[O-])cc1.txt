Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Nc1ccc(C(=O)NCC(=O)[O-])cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring (Nc1ccc1), a carboxamide group (-C(=O)N), and an ester group (-COO-). These functional groups suggest potential interactions with enzymes and receptors involved in neurotransmission and metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide and ester group could indicate the molecule may interact with enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of various drugs and endogenous substances.
Step 3: The structure also includes a benzene ring with a substituent (C(=O)NCC(=O)[O-]), which might be recognized by G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are involved in dopamine signaling.
Step 4: The overall structure does not directly suggest interactions with kinases or other protein targets listed among the genes.
Step 5: Based on the molecular features, the related genes are likely to be: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
Summary of related genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
