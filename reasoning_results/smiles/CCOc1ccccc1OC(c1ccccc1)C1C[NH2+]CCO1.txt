Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOc1ccccc1OC(c1ccccc1)C1C[NH2+]CCO1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings, including a benzene ring, a pyrrole ring, and an oxygen-containing heterocycle. This structure suggests the molecule could be a ligand or inhibitor targeting receptors or enzymes that interact with aromatic and heterocyclic compounds.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an amine group (-NH2) indicates that the molecule might act as a ligand for receptors or ion channels that have binding sites for acidic and basic functional groups. For example, the amine group could interact with acidic residues in receptor proteins, while the carboxylic acid group could form hydrogen bonds with basic residues.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a quinoline-like moiety (quinoline is a heterocyclic compound with a nitrogen atom), which is known to be involved in interactions with various biological targets such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature may suggest a potential interaction with receptors like DRD2 (Dopamine D2 receptor), HTR1A (Serotonin 1A receptor), and others from the HTR family (Serotonin receptors).
Step 4: The presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) could indicate a possible interaction with enzymes that metabolize drugs or hormones, such as those involved in cytochrome P450 metabolism (CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are known to oxidize phenolic compounds.
Step 5: Given the above structural features and the potential for interactions with receptors and metabolic enzymes, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and OPRK1.
