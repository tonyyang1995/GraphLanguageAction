Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C1NC(=O)C(c2cnc3ccccn23)=C1c1cn2c3c(cc(F)cc13)C[NH+](C(=O)[NH+]1CCCCC1)CC2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring system, which is common in many ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature may interact with receptors like CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4, which are cholinergic receptors.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a benzene ring with a cyano group (-CN), which could potentially interact with enzymes such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, known to metabolize various xenobiotics including drugs.
Step 3: The presence of a quinoline-like structure might suggest potential interactions with HTR2A, a serotonin receptor subtype, given that similar structures have been implicated in modulating serotonin signaling.
Step 4: The overall structure, particularly the presence of functional groups like amides and esters, could indicate potential binding to receptors such as DRD2 and DRD3, dopamine receptors, which are involved in neurotransmission.
Step 5: The molecule’s complex structure, including multiple rings and functional groups, suggests it may interact with several genes involved in signal transduction pathways and neurotransmitter systems, such as PTGS1, which encodes COX-1/COX-2 enzymes involved in prostaglandin synthesis.
