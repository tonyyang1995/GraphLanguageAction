Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1[nH]c2ccccc2c1NC(=O)C[NH+]1CCN(c2cccc(C(F)(F)F)c2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule is a complex organic compound with a structure that includes a benzene ring with an amide group (CON), a nitrogen atom with a hydrogen substituent, and various functional groups such as fluorine atoms and cyclohexane rings.
Step 2: This molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring, which is a five-membered heterocyclic ring containing one nitrogen atom. Pyrrolidines are known to interact with certain receptors and enzymes, particularly those involved in neurotransmission and metabolism.
Step 3: The presence of the amide group (CON) suggests potential interactions with enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYP enzymes), which metabolize drugs and other xenobiotics, including those that might interact with receptors listed in the genes.
Step 4: Given the molecular structure, it could potentially interact with receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), and serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6). These receptors are known to have ligands that include small molecules with similar structural features.
Step 5: Additionally, due to its potential for interaction with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, this molecule may also be relevant to genes encoding enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.
