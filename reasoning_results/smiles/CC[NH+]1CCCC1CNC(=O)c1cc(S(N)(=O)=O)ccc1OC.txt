Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC[NH+]1CCCC1CNC(=O)c1cc(S(N)(=O)=O)ccc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a quinoline-like core structure, which is a common feature in many ligands that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This suggests potential interactions with receptors that have quinoline binding sites.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH2) and an amide group (-CON) in the molecule could indicate its potential to act as an agonist or antagonist for GPCRs, particularly those involved in neurotransmission.
Step 3: The molecule also has a benzene ring system and a sulfur-containing heterocycle (thioether), which are known to be involved in interactions with enzymes such as cytochrome P450s (CYP enzymes). These groups may contribute to the molecule's metabolism and pharmacokinetics.
Step 4: Considering the pattern of functional groups and the overall structure, the molecule is likely to interact with receptors and enzymes associated with neurotransmission and metabolism, suggesting potential relationships with genes encoding neurotransmitter receptors and CYP enzymes.
Step 5: Based on the identified structural features, the following genes are potentially related to the molecule: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, PTGS1, and CYP3A4.
