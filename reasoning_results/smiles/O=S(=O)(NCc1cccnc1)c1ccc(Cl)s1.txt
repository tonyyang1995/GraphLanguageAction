Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=S(=O)(NCc1cccnc1)c1ccc(Cl)s1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a thioether moiety (S=O) and a quinoline-like structure with a nitrogen atom, suggesting it may be an inhibitor or activator of enzymes involved in metabolism or signaling pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a quinoline ring and a nitrogen atom could indicate potential interactions with receptors that bind to quinoline derivatives, such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), cholinergic receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), and G-protein coupled receptors (GPRs).
Step 3: The molecule also contains a benzene ring with chlorine substituents, which might influence its ability to interact with proteins like ABC transporters (ABCB1) that are known to pump out certain molecules from cells, or with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) that are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: Additionally, the structure might have some affinity for receptors like serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) due to its size and functional groups, as well as potassium channels (KCNH2) due to the presence of the thioether and quinoline motifs.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure, the related genes include: ABCB1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2.
