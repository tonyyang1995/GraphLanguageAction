Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(NC1CCCCC1)[NH+](Cc1ccccc1)Cc1ccco1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a structure that includes an aromatic ring system with a central double bond and a nitrogen atom carrying a positive charge. This structure suggests it could be a ligand or inhibitor targeting receptors or enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The molecule contains a tricyclic core structure (represented by NC1CCCCC1), which is characteristic of certain classes of drugs such as antidepressants and antipsychotics. This pattern is often seen in molecules that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The presence of a pyrrolidine ring (Cc1ccccc1) and a hydroxyl group (c1ccco1) further supports its potential interaction with GPCRs, as these functional groups are common in ligands that bind to these receptors.
Step 4: Considering the identified structural features, the molecule is likely to interact with GPCRs, which are encoded by genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4. These genes encode for alpha adrenergic receptors, dopamine receptors, and other GPCRs that play crucial roles in neurotransmission and signaling pathways.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule's structure may also interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are responsible for the metabolism of various pharmaceuticals and xenobiotics.
