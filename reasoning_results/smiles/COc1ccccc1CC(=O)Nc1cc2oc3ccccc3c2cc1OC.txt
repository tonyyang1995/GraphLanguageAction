Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccccc1CC(=O)Nc1cc2oc3ccccc3c2cc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule contains a benzene ring system (COc1ccccc1), an amide group (-CONH-), and a hydroxyl group (-OH). This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes and receptors that are involved in signal transduction, metabolism, and neurotransmission.
Step 2: The presence of the amide group could indicate a potential interaction with enzymes like CYP2D6, which metabolizes drugs containing amide bonds, or with receptors such as HTR2A and HTR2B, which bind various ligands including amine derivatives.
Step 3: The benzene ring and hydroxyl group may suggest interactions with enzymes involved in phase I drug metabolism, such as CYP1A2 and CYP2C9, which are known to metabolize compounds containing aromatic rings and hydroxyl groups.
Step 4: The overall structure also hints at possible interactions with receptors and ion channels, particularly those involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways, such as DRD2, DRD3, and KCNH2, which are G-protein coupled receptors and voltage-gated potassium channels, respectively.
Step 5: Given the structure and functional groups present, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes involved in neurotransmission, signal transduction, and drug metabolism, including CYP2D6, HTR2A, HTR2B, DRD2, DRD3, and KCNH2.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2D6
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- DRD2
- DRD3
- KCNH2 Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is most likely related to the following genes: CYP2D6, HTR2A, HTR2B, DRD2, DRD3, and KCNH2. These genes are involved in neurotransmission, signal transduction, and drug metabolism processes.
