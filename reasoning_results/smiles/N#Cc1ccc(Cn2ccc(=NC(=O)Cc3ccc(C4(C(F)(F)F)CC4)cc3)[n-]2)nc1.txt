Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N#Cc1ccc(Cn2ccc(=NC(=O)Cc3ccc(C4(C(F)(F)F)CC4)cc3)[n-]2)nc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen-nitrogen double bond (N#N) and multiple aromatic rings, suggesting it could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) and fluorine atoms (-F) indicates potential interactions with enzymes or receptors that have specific binding sites for such functional groups.
Step 3: The cyclic structure and presence of a nitrogen atom suggest possible interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are often involved in signaling cascades and neurotransmission.
Step 4: Given the structural complexity and potential for diverse interactions, the molecule may be related to genes encoding proteins involved in neurotransmitter metabolism, signal transduction, and receptor function.
Step 5: Based on the structural features, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HRH1, KDR.
