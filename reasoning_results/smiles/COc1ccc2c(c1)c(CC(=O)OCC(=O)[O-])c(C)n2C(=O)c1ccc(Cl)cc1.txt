Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc2c(c1)c(CC(=O)OCC(=O)[O-])c(C)n2C(=O)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex structure containing multiple functional groups such as an amide, ester, and a cyclic amine. These functional groups are common in ligands that interact with receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The cyclic amine group (N-cyclohexyl) is a characteristic feature of several neurotransmitter-like molecules, which can bind to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This suggests potential interaction with genes encoding for GPCRs.
Step 3: The presence of an amide group (-CONH-) and an ester group (-COOR) indicates the molecule could act as a ligand for various enzymes or receptors, particularly those involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 4: Given the structural similarity to neurotransmitters and the presence of functional groups that can interact with receptors, the molecule might be related to genes involved in neurotransmission and signaling, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode for serotonin receptors.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule may also interact with other genes involved in GPCR signaling pathways, such as PTGS1, which encodes cyclooxygenase-1, an enzyme involved in prostaglandin biosynthesis, and SLC6A4, which encodes a sodium-dependent serotonin transporter.
Summary of related gene names:
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- HTR6
- PTGS1
- SLC6A4
These genes are involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways, which aligns with the molecule's structural characteristics.
