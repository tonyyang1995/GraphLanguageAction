Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)[NH+]=C(NC#N)SCc1ccc(Br)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring system and a quinoline moiety, which are characteristic structures found in various ligands that interact with receptors such as adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a quinoline ring is particularly notable as it can form hydrogen bonds and aromatic interactions, which are important for binding to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The molecule also includes a thiol group (-SH), which can participate in covalent binding to certain enzymes or proteins, such as those involved in metabolism or signaling pathways.
Step 4: Given the molecular structure, the compound may interact with adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) due to its potential to form stable complexes through hydrogen bonding and aromatic stacking.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule might influence cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) due to the presence of functional groups that could be metabolized by these enzymes.
