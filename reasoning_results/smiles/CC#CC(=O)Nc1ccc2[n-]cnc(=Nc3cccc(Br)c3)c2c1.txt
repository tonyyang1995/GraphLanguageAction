Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC#CC(=O)Nc1ccc2[n-]cnc(=Nc3cccc(Br)c3)c2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure featuring an aromatic ring system, a benzene ring with a nitrogen atom bearing a positive charge (indicated by [n-]), and a cyano group (-CN). Additionally, it contains a carbonyl group (=O) and a bromine atom. These features suggest that the molecule could interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism or receptors that bind small molecules.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and a positively charged nitrogen suggests that this molecule could potentially interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which often have binding sites for ligands containing aromatic rings and basic functionalities. Among the listed genes, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and HRH1 are all GPCRs that could be potential targets for this molecule.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a cyano group and a carbonyl group, which are typical substituents found in drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes. CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 are enzymes that can be inhibited by such compounds. Therefore, the molecule may interact with these enzymes and affect their activity.
Step 4: Given the overall structure and functional groups present, the molecule might also influence signaling pathways through its interaction with various receptors and enzymes. For example, it could modulate the activity of dopamine receptors like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are involved in neurotransmission and could be relevant in psychiatric disorders.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the potential interactions of the molecule with the following genes are suggested: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4. These genes encode receptors and enzymes that could be directly or indirectly affected by the molecule's structure and properties.
