Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccccc1C1(O)CC[NH2+]CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring, a pyrrole ring, and a piperidine ring. It also includes an amide group (-CONH2) and a quaternary ammonium salt (+NH3). The presence of these functional groups suggests that the molecule could interact with proteins that have binding sites for aromatic rings, amides, or positively charged regions.
Step 2: The benzene ring in the molecule may be involved in interactions with proteins that have aromatic binding pockets. This is because many receptors and transporters have hydrophobic binding sites that can accommodate planar aromatic structures like benzene rings.
Step 3: The quaternary ammonium salt in the molecule indicates it has a positive charge, which could interact with negatively charged residues on proteins, such as those found in ion channels or G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 4: Given the pattern of functional groups and the presence of a piperidine ring, the molecule might interact with proteins that contain GPCRs or other receptors that bind small molecules. GPCRs are known to interact with various ligands, including amides and positively charged molecules.
Step 5: Based on the structural features of the molecule, the related genes are likely to encode proteins involved in receptor signaling pathways, drug metabolism, and neurotransmission. These include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and DRD2.
