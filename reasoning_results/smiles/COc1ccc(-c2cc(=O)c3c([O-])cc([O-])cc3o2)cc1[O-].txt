Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(-c2cc(=O)c3c([O-])cc([O-])cc3o2)cc1[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex molecule that includes a coumarin scaffold with multiple functional groups such as an ester group (-COO-) and two negatively charged oxygen atoms ([-O-]). This structural complexity suggests the molecule could have diverse pharmacological activities.
Step 2: The presence of the ester group (-COO-) and the negatively charged oxygen atoms could indicate potential interactions with various proteins, including ion channels, receptors, and enzymes. Esters can act as substrates for certain metabolic enzymes, while negatively charged groups can interact with positively charged residues on protein surfaces.
Step 3: Considering the pharmacological potential of the molecule, it might interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are encoded by several of the listed genes such as DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These receptors are known to be involved in neurotransmission and can be modulated by small molecules due to their extracellular loops and transmembrane domains.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule’s structure may also influence its interaction with enzymes like CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are part of the cytochrome P450 family and play crucial roles in drug metabolism. The presence of an ester group could make this molecule a substrate for these enzymes, affecting its bioavailability and pharmacokinetics.
Step 5: Based on the described structure and potential interactions, the related genes are: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. These genes encode proteins that are directly or indirectly involved in the binding and metabolism of the described molecule. 
Summary of Related Genes: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
