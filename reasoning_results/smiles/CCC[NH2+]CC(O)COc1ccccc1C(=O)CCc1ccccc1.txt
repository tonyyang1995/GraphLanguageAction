Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCC[NH2+]CC(O)COc1ccccc1C(=O)CCc1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple functional groups including an amide group (-NH2), an ester group (C(=O)O), and aromatic rings. The presence of these functional groups suggests the molecule could interact with proteins involved in various biological processes, such as signaling pathways and metabolism.
Step 2: The aromatic rings in the molecule are likely to be involved in hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions, which are important for binding to receptors and enzymes. Aromatic rings are common in ligands that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other membrane proteins.
Step 3: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (C(=O)O) and an amide group (-NH2) indicates the molecule could act as an inhibitor or agonist of enzymes and receptors. Specifically, these functional groups are often found in compounds that modulate the activity of GPCRs, which are encoded by several of the listed genes.
Step 4: The molecule's overall structure, with its combination of aromatic rings and polar functional groups, suggests it might interact with membrane-bound receptors. Given this, we should consider genes encoding receptors that are known to interact with similar types of molecules, such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is most likely related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4. These genes encode receptors that could potentially bind to and be modulated by the described molecule due to their structural compatibility with its functional groups and overall shape. 
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4.
