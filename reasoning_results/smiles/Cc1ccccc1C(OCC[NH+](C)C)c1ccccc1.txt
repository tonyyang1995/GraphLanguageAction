Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccccc1C(OCC[NH+](C)C)c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains multiple aromatic rings, specifically benzene rings, which are characteristic of many drugs that interact with receptors or enzymes. This suggests the molecule could be an inhibitor or activator of proteins that bind to or metabolize such structures.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (NHC(=O)C) and a phenolic hydroxyl group (OCC) indicates potential for interaction with proteins that have binding sites for these functional groups. For example, these could interact with kinases, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), or other proteins involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 3: The molecule also has a quaternary ammonium salt group ([NH+](C)C), which is often found in ligands for receptors that modulate neurotransmission or other signaling processes. This suggests possible interactions with GPCRs or ion channels.
Step 4: Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, this molecule likely interacts with several different types of proteins, including enzymes (e.g., CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and receptors (e.g., HTR2A, HTR2B, CHRM1). The diverse functionality of the molecule supports its potential to modulate various physiological processes.
Step 5: Based on the analysis, the related genes include those involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and those encoding for receptors and ion channels that might interact with the molecule (HTR2A, HTR2B, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP1A2
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- CHRM1
- CHRM3
- CHRM4
These genes encode proteins that could potentially interact with or be affected by the given molecule.
