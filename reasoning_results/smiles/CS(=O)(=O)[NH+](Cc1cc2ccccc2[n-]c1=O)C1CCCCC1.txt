Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CS(=O)(=O)[NH+](Cc1cc2ccccc2[n-]c1=O)C1CCCCC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples or additional unnecessary information.
Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a carboxylic acid group (COOH), an amide group (CON), and a guanidinium group ([NH+]). This structure suggests potential interactions with receptors that have binding sites for these functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylic acid group and an amide group indicates the molecule could interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which often have binding sites for small molecules containing similar functional groups. Specific GPCRs such as DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C are known to bind to ligands with these functional groups.
Step 3: The guanidinium group may also interact with ion channels or transporters, particularly those involved in neurotransmitter uptake or release. SLC6A2 and SLC6A4, which encode neurotransmitter transporters, might be relevant here due to their ability to bind and transport molecules with positive charges.
Step 4: The overall structure and charge distribution suggest the molecule could potentially modulate the activity of enzymes, such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are involved in phase I metabolism and could be affected by the presence of this molecule.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and potential interactions, the related genes include: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. These genes encode proteins that are directly or indirectly influenced by the molecule's chemical properties. To summarize, the related gene names are: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19.
