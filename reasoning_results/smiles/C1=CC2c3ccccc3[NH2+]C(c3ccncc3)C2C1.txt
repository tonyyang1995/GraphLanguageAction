Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C1=CC2c3ccccc3[NH2+]C(c3ccncc3)C2C1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with an amine group (-NH2) attached to a nitrogen atom that is positively charged ([NH2+]). This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction.
Step 2: The presence of aromatic rings and amine groups could indicate potential binding sites for enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP family).
Step 3: The molecule’s structure may also suggest potential interactions with receptors that have similar functional groups, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are involved in various signaling pathways.
Step 4: Given the presence of specific functional groups and the overall structure, the molecule might interact with genes encoding for enzymes and receptors involved in neurotransmission, including but not limited to CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
