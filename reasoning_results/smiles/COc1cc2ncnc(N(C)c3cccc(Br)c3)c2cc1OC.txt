Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc2ncnc(N(C)c3cccc(Br)c3)c2cc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a nitro group (-NO2) and an amide group (-CONH-), which are common in many drug-like molecules. These functional groups can interact with various proteins, including receptors and transporters.
Step 2: The presence of a bromine atom (Br) in the molecule suggests potential halogenation effects, which can influence receptor binding and activity. Bromine is known to modulate G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The molecule has a cyclic amine structure, which is typical for ligands that can bind to GPCRs such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4). These receptors are involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways.
Step 4: The presence of a quinolone-like structure (as seen in the CYP enzymes' inhibitors) indicates possible interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). These enzymes play a crucial role in drug metabolism.
Step 5: The molecule also includes a benzene ring with a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which can form hydrogen bonds and interact with ion channels (CACNA1H, KCNH2) and other protein targets.
