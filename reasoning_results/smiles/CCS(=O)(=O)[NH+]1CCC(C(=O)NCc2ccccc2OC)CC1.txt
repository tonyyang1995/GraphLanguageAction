Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCS(=O)(=O)[NH+]1CCC(C(=O)NCc2ccccc2OC)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a molecule that contains a benzene ring system, an amide group, and a carboxylic acid group. This structure suggests the molecule may be a derivative of a compound like caffeine, which is known to interact with several receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylic acid group and an amide group indicates potential for binding to ion channels and receptors, particularly those involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways. The benzene ring could contribute to interactions with various protein targets.
Step 3: Among the listed genes, several are involved in neurotransmitter systems and receptor functions, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4. These genes encode receptors for serotonin and acetylcholine, which are neurotransmitters that interact with molecules containing similar functional groups.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule’s structure might also have implications for drug metabolism, given the presence of functional groups that could be recognized by enzymes like CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and the functional groups present, the molecule is likely to be related to the genes encoding neurotransmitter receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4) and drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
