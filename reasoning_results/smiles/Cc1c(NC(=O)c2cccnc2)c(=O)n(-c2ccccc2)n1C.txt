Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1c(NC(=O)c2cccnc2)c(=O)n(-c2ccccc2)n1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule likely containing a benzene ring, amide, and nitrogen-containing heterocycles, suggesting it may be a drug-like compound with potential pharmacological activity.
Step 2: Analyzing the molecular structure, we observe the presence of a pyrrole ring (indicated by the 'N' atom with a double bond to another carbon) and an amide group (-CONH-), which are common in ligands for receptors and enzymes.
Step 3: Given the presence of the amide and the overall structure, this molecule could potentially interact with proteins involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes that metabolize neurotransmitters.
Step 4: Considering the gene list provided, several genes encode for receptors and enzymes that could interact with the described molecular features. Specifically, genes encoding for GPCRs (like DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4) and enzymes like CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 are likely candidates for interaction due to their roles in neurotransmitter metabolism and receptor signaling.
Step 5: Therefore, the molecule may be related to the following genes: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. These genes are involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism, making them relevant targets for compounds with similar structural features.
