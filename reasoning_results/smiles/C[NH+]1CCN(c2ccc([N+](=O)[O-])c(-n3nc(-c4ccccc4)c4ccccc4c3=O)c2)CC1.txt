Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+]1CCN(c2ccc([N+](=O)[O-])c(-n3nc(-c4ccccc4)c4ccccc4c3=O)c2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that includes a nitrogen atom bearing a positive charge (N+), which is often involved in forming hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions. This feature suggests the molecule may interact with proteins that have binding sites for positively charged groups.
Step 2: The molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring (N(c2ccc([N+](=O)[O-])c(-n3nc(-c4ccccc4)c4ccccc4c3=O)c2)), which is a common structural motif in many biologically active compounds. Pyrrolidines are known to form hydrogen bonds and can act as ligands for various receptors and ion channels.
Step 3: The presence of an aromatic ring system and a carboxylate group (-COO-) indicates potential for binding to enzymes or transporters that recognize such functional groups. These features are characteristic of molecules that can modulate the activity of genes involved in drug metabolism and transport.
Step 4: Given the structure's complexity and the presence of a positively charged nitrogen, the molecule might interact with receptors like adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4). These receptors are known to bind small molecules with similar chemical properties.
Step 5: Considering the above points, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
Summary of related gene names:
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- ADRB2
- DRD2
- DRD3
- DRD4 Step 5: Summary of related gene names:
- DRD4
These genes encode receptors that could potentially interact with the described molecule due to its structural features.
