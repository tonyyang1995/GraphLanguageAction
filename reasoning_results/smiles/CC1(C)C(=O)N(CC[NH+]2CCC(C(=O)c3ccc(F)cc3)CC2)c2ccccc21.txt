Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC1(C)C(=O)N(CC[NH+]2CCC(C(=O)c3ccc(F)cc3)CC2)c2ccccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule provided has a complex structure that includes an aromatic ring system, a benzene ring, a pyrrole ring, and a carboxamide group. These structural elements suggest potential interactions with proteins involved in neurotransmitter transport and receptor binding.
Step 2: Analyzing the gene features, several genes are related to neurotransmitter receptors and transporters, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4. These genes encode for receptors that bind to various neurotransmitters, including serotonin (5-HT), acetylcholine, and dopamine.
Step 3: Additionally, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 are involved in the metabolism of many drugs, which may include this molecule, suggesting potential drug-drug interactions.
Step 4: The presence of a carboxamide group could indicate the molecule might interact with proteins like OPRL1 (encoded by OPRK1), which is a mu-opioid receptor, or with other G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and the gene features, the related genes are: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, OPRK1.
Summary of related gene names:
- HTR1A
