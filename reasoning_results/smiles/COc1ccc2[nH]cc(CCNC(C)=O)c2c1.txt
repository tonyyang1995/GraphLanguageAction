Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc2[nH]cc(CCNC(C)=O)c2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with multiple functional groups including an amide, a nitrile, a phenyl ring, and a substituted benzene ring. This structure suggests the molecule could interact with proteins that bind small molecules or have enzymatic activity.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrile group (-CN) and a carboxamide group (-CONH2) indicates the molecule might be involved in enzyme inhibition, particularly those enzymes that can oxidize or reduce such functional groups. CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are known to metabolize molecules containing these functional groups, making them potential targets for this compound.
Step 3: The aromatic rings and the overall structure suggest the molecule could also interact with receptors that bind large organic molecules, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs like DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), HTR2A (Serotonin receptor 5-HT2A), and HRH1 (Histamine receptor H1) are known to have binding sites for compounds with similar structures.
Step 4: Given the presence of a nitrile group and the potential for metabolism via CYP enzymes, the molecule may also influence pathways involving these enzymes. Genes like CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6 are directly involved in the metabolic pathway of this molecule, indicating a possible pharmacological effect.
Step 5: The detailed interaction of this molecule with the identified genes would depend on further biochemical studies, but based on its structure, it is likely to have significant interactions with enzymes and receptors listed above.
