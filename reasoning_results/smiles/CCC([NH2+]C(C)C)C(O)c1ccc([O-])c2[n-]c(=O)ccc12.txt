Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCC([NH2+]C(C)C)C(O)c1ccc([O-])c2[n-]c(=O)ccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure containing a benzene ring, a pyrrolidine ring, and an amide group. These structural features suggest that it could be a ligand or substrate for enzymes involved in metabolism or transport processes.
Step 2: Among the given genes, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 are known to be involved in the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics. The presence of an amide group and potential aromatic rings in the molecule may make it a substrate for these cytochrome P450 enzymes, indicating a possible metabolic interaction.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a quinoline-like structure (quinoline is a common pharmacophore in many drugs). This structure could potentially interact with receptors such as HTR2A (serotonin 5-HT2A receptor) and HTR2B (serotonin 5-HT2B receptor), which are known targets for certain types of drugs.
Step 4: The presence of a quaternary ammonium group (-NH2+) and a carboxylate group (-COO-) in the molecule suggests it might interact with ion channels or transporters. Genes like KCNH2 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2) and SLC6A4 (solute carrier family 6 member 4) could be relevant due to their roles in potassium channel function and neurotransmitter reuptake, respectively.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule appears to have potential interactions with the following genes: CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, KCNH2, and SLC6A4. These genes are involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmitter signaling, and ion channel function, which aligns with the molecule’s chemical structure and potential biological activities.
