Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: FC(F)(F)c1c(N2CCC(c3ccccc3)CC2)ccn2c(CC3CC3)nnc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains multiple fluorine (F) atoms and a cyclic structure with nitrogen (N), carbon (C), and oxygen (O) atoms. This indicates that the molecule likely has a complex pharmacophore with potential interactions involving aromatic and polar regions.
Step 2: The cyclic structure includes a pyrrole ring (N-containing five-membered ring) and possibly a piperidine ring (six-membered N-containing ring). These rings can form hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, which are important for binding to receptors or enzymes.
Step 3: The presence of a nitrogen atom in a cyclic structure suggests that the molecule may have a basic functional group, such as an amine or amide, which could interact with acidic residues on proteins, particularly ion channels or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 4: Considering the gene list provided, several genes encode proteins involved in neurotransmission and receptor function, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and SIGMAR1. These genes code for serotonin and acetylcholine receptors, as well as sigma-1 receptors, which are all GPCRs. The molecule's structure, with its potential for hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions, could make it a candidate ligand for these receptors.
Step 5: The molecule may also be relevant to genes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which encode cytochrome P450 enzymes that metabolize many drugs. The presence of multiple substituents, including fluorines, might influence the molecule's metabolic stability and clearance.
Summary of related gene names:
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- HTR6
- DRD2
- DRD3
- DRD4
- CHRM1
- CHRM3
- CHRM4
- SIGMAR1
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
These genes are associated with neurotransmitter receptors and drug metabolism, suggesting the molecule could potentially interact with them. However, further experimental validation would be necessary to confirm these relationships.
