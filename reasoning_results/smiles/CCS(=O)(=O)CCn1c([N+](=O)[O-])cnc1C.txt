Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCS(=O)(=O)CCn1c([N+](=O)[O-])cnc1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule has a core structure consisting of a benzene ring with a carbonyl group attached, which is characteristic of compounds that can interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes. This suggests potential interactions with CYP enzymes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
Step 2: The molecule also contains a nitrophenol group, which is known to be metabolized by CYP enzymes, further supporting its interaction with CYP2C19 and CYP2D6.
Step 3: The presence of an amide group and a carboxylic acid group indicates potential interactions with receptors and transporters involved in neurotransmission and metabolism. This could relate to genes such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and SLC6A4.
Step 4: The nitrogen-containing heterocyclic structure (indicated by n1c([N+](=O)[O-])cnc1) may interact with ion channels or receptors, potentially linking to genes like KCNH2 and DRD2.
Step 5: Given the complex structure and the presence of multiple functional groups, the molecule is likely to have interactions with several genes, including CYP2D6, CYP2C19, HTR2A, HTR2B, SLC6A4, and KCNH2.
Summary of Related Genes: CYP2D6, CYP2C19, HTR2A, HTR2B, SLC6A4, KCNH2.
