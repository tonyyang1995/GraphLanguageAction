Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Nc1cccc2nsnc12)c1ccc(-c2cccc(Cl)c2)o1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound with a central carbon atom double-bonded to a nitrogen atom, which is part of an amino group (-NH2). This nitrogen is also attached to a benzene ring that contains a sulfoxide (S=O) group. The molecule has several substituents including a nitrile group (-CN), chlorine atoms, and other aromatic rings. The overall structure suggests the molecule could be a drug-like compound.
Step 2: Given the presence of a benzene ring and functional groups such as the sulfoxide and nitrile, this molecule likely interacts with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways and may have pharmacological activity. Specific proteins that could interact with such a structure include receptors and enzymes.
Step 3: Receptors that might interact with this molecule include adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), which are G-protein coupled receptors often modulated by drugs, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), which also respond to ligands and can be targets for pharmacological intervention.
Step 4: Enzymes that could be affected by this molecule include cytochrome P450 enzymes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs and xenobiotics. The presence of a sulfoxide group indicates potential metabolism by these enzymes.
Step 5: Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6. These genes encode proteins that could interact directly or indirectly with the described molecule, potentially affecting its pharmacological activity or metabolism. The exact nature of the interaction would depend on the precise binding site and mechanism of action of the molecule.
