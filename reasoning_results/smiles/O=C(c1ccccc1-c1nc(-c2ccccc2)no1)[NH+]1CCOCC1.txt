Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(c1ccccc1-c1nc(-c2ccccc2)no1)[NH+]1CCOCC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, a nitrile group (-CN), and an amide group (-CONH-). These structural features suggest potential interactions with enzymes or receptors that are involved in drug metabolism or neurotransmission.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and amide group is characteristic of molecules that can act as substrates for CYP enzymes, specifically CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize a wide range of drugs including those affecting neurotransmission.
Step 3: The nitrile group could interact with deaminases or other enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism, potentially affecting genes like PTGS1 (which encodes COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes involved in prostaglandin synthesis).
Step 4: Given the amine group (-NH2) and the overall structure, the molecule might interact with receptors such as HTR2A and HTR2B, which are serotonin receptors, or with adrenergic receptors like ADRA1D and ADRA2B, given their role in neurotransmitter signaling.
Step 5: The molecule's structure also suggests possible interactions with genes involved in G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathways, such as HRH1 (histamine receptor H1) and CHRM1 (cholinergic receptor, muscarinic M1).
