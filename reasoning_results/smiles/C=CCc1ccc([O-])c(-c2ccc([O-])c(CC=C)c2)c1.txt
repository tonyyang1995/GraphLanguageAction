Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C=CCc1ccc([O-])c(-c2ccc([O-])c(CC=C)c2)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with multiple rings and functional groups, including a double bond (C=), a phenolic group (-OH), and a negatively charged oxygen atom ([O-]). This structure suggests the molecule could be an alkaloid, a class of naturally occurring organic compounds that often have biological activity.
Step 2: Given the presence of multiple aromatic rings and the possibility of being an alkaloid, this molecule might interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, neurotransmission, and receptor modulation. These interactions could be mediated through binding to specific receptors or enzymes.
Step 3: Considering the molecular features, the molecule might potentially influence G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and serotonergic receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6). These receptors are known to modulate various physiological responses and could be affected by molecules with similar structures.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule’s potential for interaction with enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) cannot be ruled out, as these enzymes play crucial roles in drug metabolism. The presence of a phenolic group and a double bond could indicate the molecule might be metabolized by these enzymes, leading to possible pharmacokinetic effects.
Step 5: Based on the described structure and potential interactions, the related genes are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. 
Summary: The related gene names are ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.
