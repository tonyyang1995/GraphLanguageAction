Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COCCNC(=O)c1cc(-c2ccc(OC)c(OC)c2)on1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a molecule that includes a benzene ring, an amide group (-CONH-), and a pyrrolidine ring. The presence of these structural features suggests that the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors.
Step 2: The molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring, which is known to interact with various G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Specifically, this type of functional group can form hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions with the transmembrane domains of GPCRs, affecting their activity.
Step 3: Among the listed genes, several are associated with GPCRs: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes encode for different subtypes of adrenergic and cholinergic receptors and serotonin receptors, respectively. The presence of a pyrrolidine ring in the molecule suggests it might interact with these receptors.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule has an amide group, which can act as a potential substrate for certain enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs. The amide group could also interact with enzymes like ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein) and CYP3A4, which play roles in drug transport and metabolism.
Step 5: Based on the structural features of the molecule, it is likely to have interactions with GPCRs (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) and enzymes involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, ABCB1, CYP3A4).
Summary of related gene names:
- GPCRs: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- Drug Metabolism Enzymes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, ABCB1, CYP3A4 Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a molecule that includes a benzene ring, an amide group (-CONH-), and a pyrrolidine ring. The presence of these structural features suggests that the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors.
Step 2: The pyrrolidine ring in the molecule indicates potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), given its ability to form hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions with transmembrane domains of GPCRs.
Step 3: Several genes from the list are associated with GPCRs: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and H
