Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])CCCCC1SCC2NC(=O)NC21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a structure that includes an aromatic ring system, specifically a benzene ring, and a carbonyl group (C=O). This type of chemical structure is often involved in interactions with enzymes and receptors that are part of signaling pathways and metabolic processes.
Step 2: Among the provided genes, several are involved in drug metabolism and transport, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are all cytochrome P450 enzymes that play a role in the metabolism of drugs. The presence of a benzene ring and a carbonyl group in the molecule suggests it could be a substrate for these enzymes, indicating potential interaction with these genes.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule contains a thioether (-S-) group, which is known to interact with certain protein targets like kinases. Genes such as LCK and KDR are kinases, and the thioether group might allow the molecule to bind to these proteins, affecting their activity.
Step 4: Furthermore, the molecule's structure may also interact with neurotransmitter receptors, particularly those involved in GABAergic and dopaminergic systems. Genes such as DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C encode for dopamine receptors and serotonin receptors, respectively, and the presence of functional groups like amide and alcohol (-OH) might enable the molecule to modulate these receptors' activities.
Step 5: Lastly, the molecule's structure may influence genes involved in inflammatory responses, such as PTGS1 (also known as COX-1), which encodes cyclooxygenase-1, an enzyme that is inhibited by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
Summary of related genes:
- Drug metabolism and transport: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4
- Kinases: LCK, KDR
- Neurotransmitter receptors: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- Inflammatory response: PTGS1 (COX-1) To summarize, the molecule appears to have potential interactions with several genes involved in drug metabolism, kinase activity, neurotransmission, and inflammation. The specific genes include CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, LCK, KDR, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and PTGS1. These relationships suggest the molecule could affect various biological processes and potentially have therapeutic applications.
