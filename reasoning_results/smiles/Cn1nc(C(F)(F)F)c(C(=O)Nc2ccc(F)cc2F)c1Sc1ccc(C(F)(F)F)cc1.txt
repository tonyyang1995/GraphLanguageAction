Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cn1nc(C(F)(F)F)c(C(=O)Nc2ccc(F)cc2F)c1Sc1ccc(C(F)(F)F)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains multiple fluorine atoms (F) and is highly substituted, particularly around the central nitrogen atom. This substitution pattern suggests potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for aromatic and/or polar groups.
Step 2: The presence of a phenyl ring system, specifically in the central part of the molecule, indicates possible interaction with proteins containing hydrophobic binding pockets, such as those involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a carboxamide group (-CONH2) and an amide group (-CON), which are common in molecules that interact with enzymes or receptors. These functional groups suggest the molecule might be a ligand or inhibitor for enzymes or receptors.
Step 4: Given the above structural features, the molecule could potentially interact with GPCRs (e.g., ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4) due to its aromatic and polar substituents, as well as with enzymes like CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 because of the presence of aromatic rings and amide groups.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule's potential to inhibit or activate enzymes could relate to genes involved in drug metabolism and signaling pathways, such as ABCB1, CYP3A4, and SLC6A4.
Summary of related gene names:
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- ADRB2
- CHRM1
- CHRM3
- CHRM4
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
- ABCB1
- CYP3A4
- SLC6A4
Note: This analysis assumes the molecule has biological activity and interacts with proteins in the manner suggested by its structure. The exact interactions would require further experimental validation. Step 1: The molecule contains multiple fluorine atoms (F) and is highly substituted, indicating it may interact with proteins that bind aromatic and polar groups.
Step 2: The phenyl ring system in the central part of the molecule suggests potential interaction with hydrophobic binding sites, particularly in GPCR signaling pathways.
Step 3: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH2) and an amide group (-CON) implies the molecule could interact with enzymes or receptors, possibly affecting their function.
Step 4: The molecule's structure suggests it could interact with GPCRs (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4) and enzymes (CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6).
Step 5: Potential interactions with ABCB1, CYP3A4, and SLC6A4 are also considered due to the molecule's ability to influence enzyme activity and transport.
