Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([NH+]=C(N=c1cc(C(F)(F)F)[n-][n-]1)Nc1cc(F)cc(Cl)c1)c1cccc(Cl)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a number of functional groups such as amide (C=O), amidine (N+=C), aromatic rings (c1cc...c1), and halogen substituents (F, Cl). These structural elements suggest that the molecule could be involved in interactions with proteins that recognize or bind to similar chemical moieties.
Step 2: Among the provided genes, several are known to encode receptors or enzymes that interact with small molecules. For instance, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 are cytochrome P450 enzymes which are responsible for metabolizing various drugs and xenobiotics, potentially interacting with the functional groups present in the molecule.
Step 3: Additionally, some of the genes encode neurotransmitter receptors. For example, HTR1A, HTR2A, and HTR2C encode serotonin receptors, which might interact with the amidine group in the molecule due to its potential to form hydrogen bonds and other electrostatic interactions.
Step 4: Furthermore, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4 encode muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, which could also engage in interactions with the molecule based on its overall charge distribution and hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the related genes are likely to be: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4. These genes are associated with drug metabolism and neurotransmission pathways, respectively.
