Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC[NH+](CC)C(=O)c1ccc(C2=CC3(CC[NH2+]CC3)Oc3cccc([O-])c32)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule, which appears to be a derivative of an amide with a pyrrolidine ring, likely acting as a potential ligand for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structure includes a positively charged amine group (-NH+) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which are common functional groups in molecules that interact with GPCRs.
Step 2: The presence of a positively charged amine group (-NH+) suggests that this molecule could act as a partial agonist or antagonist for GPCRs, as positively charged groups can interact with the extracellular loops of these receptors. The positively charged group may also facilitate the binding of the molecule to the receptor through electrostatic interactions.
Step 3: Considering the GPCR interaction potential, the molecule could potentially interact with several of the listed genes, particularly those encoding for GPCRs such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes encode for different subtypes of adrenergic, cholinergic, and dopaminergic receptors, all of which are GPCRs.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule might have indirect effects on other genes due to its pharmacological activity. For instance, it could influence genes involved in signaling pathways downstream of GPCRs, such as PTGS1 (encoding cyclooxygenase-1, which is involved in prostaglandin synthesis), and SIGMAR1 (encoding sigma-1 receptor, which can modulate the function of GPCRs).
Step 5: Based on the described structure and potential interactions, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, PTGS1, and SIGMAR1.
