Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C1c2ccccc2S(=O)(=O)[NH+]1Cc1cccc2ccccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring system with an oxazole group attached to it, which is characteristic of the ligands for the serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6). This suggests that the molecule may interact with these receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) indicates potential activity as a reversible inhibitor of CYP2C19, an enzyme involved in drug metabolism. CYP2C19 is listed among the provided genes.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a quinoline-like structure, which could suggest interactions with genes such as CYP2D6, known for its role in the metabolism of various drugs, including those that are substrates of CYP2D6.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in the molecule might indicate potential interaction with genes like PTGS1, which encodes cyclooxygenase-1, an enzyme involved in prostaglandin synthesis.
Step 5: Considering the above structural features, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: CYP2C19, CYP2D6, PTGS1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
Summary of related genes: CYP2C19, CYP2D6, PTGS1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
