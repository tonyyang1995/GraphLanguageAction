Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C1OCCC1Sc1nnc(-c2ccc([O-])cc2)o1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an oxygen atom double-bonded to carbon (C=O), which are characteristic of compounds that can interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism. This suggests potential interactions with genes encoding enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 2: The presence of an alcohol group (-OH) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) indicates the molecule could be an inhibitor or substrate for enzymes involved in the metabolism of fatty acids and other molecules. This points to possible interactions with genes like CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and PTGS1.
Step 3: The molecule has a structure that includes a benzene ring with a nitro group (-NO2) and a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH), which are often recognized by receptors and transporters. This may indicate interactions with genes such as DRD2, HTR2A, and SLC6A4, which encode dopamine receptors and serotonin receptors, respectively.
Step 4: The presence of a pyrimidine ring and a quinoline ring, along with the overall aromatic structure, suggests the molecule could interact with ion channels and transporters. Genes like KCNH2 and SLC6A2 might be involved due to their roles in potassium channel function and neurotransmitter transport.
Step 5: Given the diverse functional groups and structural elements in the molecule, it is likely to have multiple interactions with various genes involved in metabolism, signaling, and transport. The related genes include CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP3A4, PTGS1, DRD2, HTR2A, SLC6A4, KCNH2, and SLC6A2.
