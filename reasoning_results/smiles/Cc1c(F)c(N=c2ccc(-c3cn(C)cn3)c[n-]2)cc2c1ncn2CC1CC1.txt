Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1c(F)c(N=c2ccc(-c3cn(C)cn3)c[n-]2)cc2c1ncn2CC1CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound with multiple functional groups including fluorine (F), nitrogen (N), and carbon (C). It contains aromatic rings and a benzene ring system. The presence of heteroatoms like nitrogen and fluorine suggests potential for interaction with proteins that bind small molecules, particularly those involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction.
Step 2: Analyzing the pattern of the molecule, it includes a pyrrole ring fused to a benzene ring, which is characteristic of some ligands for receptors such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature could indicate a potential interaction with receptors that have similar binding sites.
Step 3: The molecule also has a structure that might allow it to interact with ion channels or enzymes due to its hydrophobic regions and charged functionalities. This is relevant because several of the listed genes are associated with ion channels or enzymes involved in metabolism.
Step 4: Given the presence of multiple functional groups and the overall structure, this molecule could potentially interact with receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways. Genes like HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and HRH1 are all involved in these pathways and could be affected by the molecule.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule’s ability to bind to proteins might also be relevant to genes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which encode enzymes that metabolize many drugs and xenobiotics.
