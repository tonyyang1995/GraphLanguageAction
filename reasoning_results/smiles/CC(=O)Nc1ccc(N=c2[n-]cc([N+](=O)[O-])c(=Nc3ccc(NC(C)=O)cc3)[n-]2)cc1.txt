Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(N=c2[n-]cc([N+](=O)[O-])c(=Nc3ccc(NC(C)=O)cc3)[n-]2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a core structure of a benzene ring attached to an amide group (CON), which suggests it could be a drug-like molecule. The presence of a nitrogen atom within a benzene ring indicates the possibility of a heterocyclic ring system, such as a pyrrole or indole, which are common in many biologically active molecules.
Step 2: The molecule contains a nitrile (-CN) group, which is often found in drugs targeting various biological pathways, including those involving G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). The nitrile group could be involved in forming hydrogen bonds or other interactions with proteins that contain these receptors.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a pyridine ring (N-closed aromatic ring), which is another common feature in bioactive compounds, particularly those interacting with enzymes and receptors. Pyridine rings can participate in stacking interactions and hydrogen bonding, contributing to the binding affinity of the molecule to its target proteins.
Step 4: Considering the presence of a nitrile group and a pyridine ring, the molecule might interact with GPCRs, which are a family of receptors that include adrenergic receptors (such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (such as CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4). These receptors play significant roles in neurotransmission and are involved in various physiological processes, making them potential targets for the described molecular structure.
Step 5: Based on the molecular features identified, the most likely related genes are those encoding for GPCRs, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4. These genes encode receptors that are known to interact with ligands that share structural similarities with the given molecule.
Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4.
