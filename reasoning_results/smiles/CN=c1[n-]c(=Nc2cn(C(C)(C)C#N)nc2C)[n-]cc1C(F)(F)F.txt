Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CN=c1[n-]c(=Nc2cn(C(C)(C)C#N)nc2C)[n-]cc1C(F)(F)F, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple functional groups such as nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, and fluorine atoms. It includes a cyclic structure with aromatic rings and a negatively charged nitrogens. This molecule appears to be an inhibitor or modulator of certain enzymes due to its chemical structure.
Step 2: The molecule's structure suggests it could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, given the presence of aromatic rings and nitrogen functionalities which are common in ligands for receptors and enzymes. Specifically, the presence of a benzene ring and a nitro group indicates potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYP).
Step 3: Considering the pattern of the molecule, it might target or influence the expression or activity of genes encoding for proteins involved in neurotransmission and hormone signaling, as well as drug metabolism. This is because the molecule contains functional groups that are known to bind to and modulate the activity of these types of proteins.
Step 4: The gene CYP2D6, which codes for an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many drugs, including some antidepressants and antipsychotics, may have a direct interaction with this molecule. Additionally, the gene DRD2, which encodes for a dopamine receptor, might also be influenced due to the molecule's ability to modulate neurotransmitter signaling.
Step 5: Given the above considerations, the related genes include: CYP2D6, DRD2. These genes are involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmission, respectively, making them likely targets for the described molecule. 
Summary of Related Genes: CYP2D6, DRD2. 
These genes are directly or indirectly affected by the molecule due to its chemical structure and potential to interact with enzymes and receptors involved in these processes. Other genes listed may not have a direct relationship based on the provided information about the molecule's structure. However, further research would be needed to confirm these relationships.
