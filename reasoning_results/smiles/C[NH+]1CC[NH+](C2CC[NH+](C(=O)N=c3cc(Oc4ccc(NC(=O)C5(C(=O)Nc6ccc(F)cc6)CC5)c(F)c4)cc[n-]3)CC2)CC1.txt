Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+]1CC[NH+](C2CC[NH+](C(=O)N=c3cc(Oc4ccc(NC(=O)C5(C(=O)Nc6ccc(F)cc6)CC5)c(F)c4)cc[n-]3)CC2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains multiple nitrogen atoms, including amine groups (-NH2), amidine groups (-NHC(=O)-), and amide groups (-CONH-). This indicates the presence of functional groups that can interact with receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a benzene ring system and a quinoline-like structure, which are common in ligands for various G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other protein targets.
Step 3: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH-) and a benzene ring with potential electrophilic aromatic substitution sites suggests interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: Given the complexity of the molecule and its potential to interact with multiple biological targets, it may have effects on neurotransmitter systems, which could relate to genes encoding receptors such as DRD2, HTR2A, and HTR2B, which are involved in serotonin signaling.
Step 5: The molecule’s structure also hints at possible interactions with ion channels and transporters, which might be relevant to genes like KCNH2 and SLC6A4, involved in potassium channel function and monoamine transporter activity, respectively.
Summary of Related Genes: ABL1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, PTGS1, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4. Note that not all genes listed are directly related based on the structural analysis but are included here for completeness. The primary focus should be on CYP enzymes, DRD, and HTR genes.
