Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(S(N)(=O)=O)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this is relevant.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) attached to it. This structure is commonly found in molecules that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are encoded by genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
Step 2: The molecule also has a pyrrole ring, which is known to be involved in interactions with enzymes such as cytochrome P450s (CYPs). Specifically, the CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 genes encode enzymes that can metabolize this type of molecule.
Step 3: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) on the molecule indicates potential interactions with enzymes like CYP1A2, which can metabolize nitroaromatic compounds.
Step 4: The overall structure suggests possible interactions with receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and inflammation, which are encoded by genes like HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, PTGS1, and SIGMAR1.
Step 5: The molecule does not show clear structural features that would suggest direct interaction with other specified genes such as ABCB1, ABL1, CA12, CA2, CA9, CACNA1H, CDK2, ESR1, FLT1, HRH1, KDR, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, PPARG, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, or KCNH2.
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, PTGS1, SIGMAR1. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), which is often associated with GPCR interactions.
Step 2: It also includes a pyrrole ring, indicating potential enzyme interactions, particularly with CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 3: The nitro group (-NO2) suggests possible metabolism by CYP1A2.
Step 4: The structure hints at involvement with neurotransmission and inflammation, related to HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, PTGS1, and SIGMAR1.
Step 5: No clear structural features link the molecule directly to other listed genes.
