Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1onc(-c2ccccc2)c1-c1ccc(S(N)(=O)=O)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with an amide group (-CONH2) attached, which is characteristic of drugs that can interact with various receptors and enzymes. This structural feature suggests potential interactions with genes encoding for receptors and enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a sulfhydryl group (-SH) in the molecule indicates it could be a thiol-containing compound. Thiols are known to modulate the activity of cysteine proteases, ion channels, and receptors. This structural element points towards possible interactions with genes encoding for these types of proteins.
Step 3: The molecule includes a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which can form hydrogen bonds and participate in ionization. This property might lead to interactions with genes encoding for ion channels, transporters, and receptors that have acidic residues or are involved in signaling pathways.
Step 4: The molecule also possesses a pyrrolidine ring, which can adopt various conformations and potentially interact with proteins through hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions. This structural feature may suggest interactions with genes encoding for proteins containing hydrophobic regions or those involved in protein-protein interactions.
Step 5: Based on the above structural analysis, the molecule may be related to genes encoding for proteins such as ion channels (CACNA1H, KCNH2), receptors (DRD2, DRD3, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), enzymes involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), and transporters (SLC6A2, SLC6A4). These genes are likely to be influenced by the molecule due to its potential to modulate their activities through direct binding or allosteric effects. 
Related gene names: CACNA1H, KCNH2, DRD2, DRD3, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
