Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1cc(CSc2nnc(-c3cccnc3)n2-c2ccccc2F)nc2sccn12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups including an aromatic ring system, a cyano group (-CN), and a fluorine atom (F). These features suggest that the molecule could be involved in interactions with proteins that bind to or interact with aromatic rings, such as those containing cyano or fluorine substituents.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) and a fluorine atom (F) in the molecule indicates potential for interaction with proteins that have binding sites for these functional groups, which are often found in receptors and enzymes. This could include G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Step 3: Considering the pattern of the molecule and its functional groups, it is likely to interact with genes encoding for receptors such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6. These genes encode for various subtypes of adrenergic and serotonergic receptors, which often contain hydrophobic binding pockets that can accommodate aromatic and polar functional groups like -CN and F.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule may also interact with genes encoding for enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. These enzymes are part of the cytochrome P450 family and play crucial roles in drug metabolism, and their active sites might be suitable for binding molecules with specific functional groups like -CN and F.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis and the potential interactions with the identified genes, the related gene names are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. These genes are primarily involved in neurotransmitter signaling and drug metabolism, suggesting that the molecule could have implications in these biological processes. 
Summary of related gene names:
- ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2
- CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4
These genes are involved in neurotransmitter signaling and drug metabolism, indicating that the molecule may have significant interactions with these pathways.
