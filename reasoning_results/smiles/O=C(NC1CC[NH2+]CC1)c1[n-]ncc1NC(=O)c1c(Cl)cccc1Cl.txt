Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(NC1CC[NH2+]CC1)c1[n-]ncc1NC(=O)c1c(Cl)cccc1Cl, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with a nitrile group (-CN), an amide group (-CONH2), and multiple aromatic heterocycles including pyrrolidine and piperidine rings. These structural features are indicative of small molecule ligands that often interact with receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrile group and an amide group suggests the molecule could be a potential inhibitor or agonist for various protein targets, such as ion channels, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), or enzymes. This is because these functional groups can form hydrogen bonds and π-π stacking interactions, which are crucial for binding to proteins.
Step 3: Considering the gene list provided, several genes encode for GPCRs and enzymes. For example, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 all encode for GPCRs, while CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 encode for cytochrome P450 enzymes. The molecule's ability to form hydrogen bonds and π-π stacking interactions makes it plausible that it could bind to these proteins.
Step 4: Furthermore, the molecule's benzene ring system and aromatic heterocycles might also allow for interaction with ion channels encoded by genes like KCNH2, which encodes for a voltage-gated potassium channel. Such interactions could modulate the function of these channels.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and potential binding sites, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.
