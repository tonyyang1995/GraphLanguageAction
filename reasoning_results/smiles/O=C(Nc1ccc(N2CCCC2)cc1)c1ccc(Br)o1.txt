Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Nc1ccc(N2CCCC2)cc1)c1ccc(Br)o1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure including an aromatic ring system with nitrogen atoms, a bromine atom, and multiple carbon chains. The presence of nitrogen and bromine suggests potential for interaction with proteins that bind to such functional groups, which are common in neurotransmitters and other signaling molecules.
Step 2: Considering the pattern of the molecule, it could potentially interact with receptors or enzymes that recognize aromatic nitrogen-containing compounds. This includes G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs), both of which are known to interact with various small molecules.
Step 3: The presence of a benzene ring with a nitrogen and a bromine atom is reminiscent of ligands that might activate or inhibit GPCRs, particularly those involved in neurotransmission and hormone signaling pathways. Therefore, this molecule might be relevant to genes encoding GPCRs such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
Step 4: Additionally, the structure of the molecule may suggest it could be metabolized by enzymes like CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism. Thus, the molecule could also be related to genes encoding these enzymes such as CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These genes are primarily associated with receptor activation and drug metabolism processes.
