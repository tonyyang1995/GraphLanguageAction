Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+]1Cc2c(N)cccc2C(c2ccccc2)C1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (N+), a benzene ring, and several other functional groups including a pyrrole ring and a phenyl group. This molecular structure suggests that the compound could interact with proteins that have binding sites for aromatic compounds and positively charged amino acids.
Step 2: Considering the presence of a positively charged nitrogen and the aromatic rings, this molecule might be able to bind to ion channels or receptors that have specific affinity for such structures. For instance, it could potentially interact with voltage-gated sodium channels, which are known to have regions that can bind to positively charged molecules.
Step 3: Among the listed genes, those encoding ion channels and receptors are particularly relevant. These include KCNH2 (encoding the hERG potassium channel), which is known to interact with positively charged ligands, and ADRA1D, ADRA2B, and ADRB2 (encoding adrenergic receptors), which also have binding sites for various ligands including some that are positively charged.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure may allow it to interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize many drugs with similar structural features.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the related genes are likely to be those encoding ion channels and receptors, as well as enzymes involved in drug metabolism. The specific genes include: KCNH2, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
