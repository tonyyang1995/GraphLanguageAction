Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccccc1[NH+]1C(=O)c2cc(S(N)(=O)=O)c(Cl)cc2[NH2+]C1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a quinoline ring system, which is characteristic of many ligands for receptors such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature suggests potential interactions with genes encoding for GPCRs.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-CONH2) and a sulfonamide (-NSO2-) suggests that the molecule could be an inhibitor or agonist for enzymes or receptors that recognize these functional groups, such as certain kinases or GPCRs.
Step 3: The molecule also has a pyrrolidine ring, which is known to interact with various receptor types, including GPCRs and ion channels. This structural feature points towards possible interactions with genes encoding for these receptors or channels.
Step 4: Considering the overall structure and functional groups, the molecule is likely to interact with GPCRs, specifically those involved in neurotransmitter signaling, such as HTR2A (serotonin receptor), HTR2B, and HTR2C (serotonin receptors).
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related genes are: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6. These genes encode serotonin receptors, which are GPCRs that could potentially bind to or be modulated by the described molecule. 
Related Genes: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
