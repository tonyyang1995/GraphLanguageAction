Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+]1CC[NH+](CC(=O)N2c3ccccc3C(=O)Nc3cccnc32)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom that is positively charged, indicated by [NH+]. This feature suggests the molecule may interact with proteins that have binding sites for positively charged amino acid residues.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which could potentially interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways or enzymes.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of aromatic rings and their conjugated systems might influence the molecule's interaction with ion channels or receptors that are sensitive to changes in electrical charge or membrane potential.
Step 4: Given the complex structure with multiple functional groups and aromatic rings, this molecule could interact with a variety of proteins, but the most likely candidates would be those involved in neurotransmission, signal transduction, and drug metabolism.
Step 5: Based on the identified structural features, the most relevant genes for this molecule are those associated with neurotransmission (e.g., DRD2, DRD3, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), signal transduction (e.g., PTGS1), and drug metabolism (e.g., CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). 
Summary of related genes: DRD2, DRD3, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, PTGS1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
