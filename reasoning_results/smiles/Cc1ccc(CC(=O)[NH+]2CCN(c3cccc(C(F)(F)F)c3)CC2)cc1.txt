Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(CC(=O)[NH+]2CCN(c3cccc(C(F)(F)F)c3)CC2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with multiple functional groups including a benzene ring, an amide group, and several heteroatoms such as nitrogen and fluorine. The presence of these features suggests that the molecule may interact with proteins involved in signaling pathways, transport, and metabolism.
Step 2: Analyzing the structure further, the amide group and the presence of nitrogen atoms indicate potential binding sites for proteins that have similar functional groups. This includes enzymes involved in drug metabolism (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) which are known to bind and modify xenobiotics through oxidation, reduction, or hydrolysis reactions.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a quinoline-like structure (quinoline is a heterocyclic compound containing a benzene ring fused to a pyridine ring), which could potentially interact with receptors and ion channels. For instance, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and HTR2A (serotonin receptor) might be affected due to their roles in neurotransmitter metabolism and signaling.
Step 4: Given the fluorinated substituents attached to the aromatic rings, this molecule might also interact with membrane proteins such as ion channels (e.g., KCNH2, HTR1A, HTR2C, and DRD2). Fluorine atoms can stabilize protein-ligand interactions by forming hydrogen bonds or hydrophobic contacts.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and functional groups, the molecule is likely to interact with several genes involved in neurotransmission, drug metabolism, and signal transduction. These include CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, and DRD3.
Summary of related genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3.
