Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cn1c(=O)c2c(ncn2CC(O)CO)n(C)c1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples.
Step 1: The molecule, represented by the SMILES string Cn1c(=O)c2c(ncn2CC(O)CO)n(C)c1=O, has a structure that includes a benzene ring, an amide group (-CONH-), and a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH). These structural features suggest potential interactions with proteins involved in drug metabolism and transport.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group suggests that the molecule could be a substrate for enzymes involved in the metabolism of amides, such as CYP2D6 and CYP2C9. These enzymes are known to metabolize drugs containing amide groups, which might indicate a relationship between the molecule and these genes.
Step 3: The phenolic hydroxyl group may also interact with proteins that bind or metabolize phenolic compounds, such as CYP1A2 and CYP2C19. These enzymes play roles in the metabolism of various drugs and xenobiotics, which might further suggest a relationship between the molecule and these genes.
Step 4: Given the molecule's structure, it could potentially influence the function of receptors and ion channels. For example, the molecule might interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like HTR2A, HTR2B, and DRD2, which are known to bind to various ligands and modulate their signaling pathways. Additionally, it might affect voltage-gated potassium channels, such as KCNH2, which are involved in cellular excitability.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is most likely related to the following genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, KCNH2. These genes are involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmission, and ion channel regulation, which aligns with the molecule's structural features. 
Summary of Related Genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, KCNH2.
