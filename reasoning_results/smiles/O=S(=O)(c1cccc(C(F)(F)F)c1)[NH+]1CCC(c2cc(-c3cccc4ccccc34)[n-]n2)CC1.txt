Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=S(=O)(c1cccc(C(F)(F)F)c1)[NH+]1CCC(c2cc(-c3cccc4ccccc34)[n-]n2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a structure that includes an oxygen-sulfur double bond (O=S), which is characteristic of a sulfonate ester or sulfoxide. This functional group is often involved in interactions with proteins that have specific binding sites for such moieties, such as certain G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes.
Step 2: The molecule also contains a benzene ring with fluorine substituents (F groups). Fluorinated benzene derivatives are known to interact with various drug targets, including ion channels and receptors, due to their lipophilicity and ability to modulate receptor activity.
Step 3: The presence of a pyrrolidine ring and a quaternary ammonium group suggests that this molecule may act as an agonist or antagonist at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which are GPCRs. Specific genes like CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4 encode subunits of nAChRs.
Step 4: The overall structure indicates potential interaction with enzymes such as CYP2D6, which metabolizes many drugs, and CYP3A4, another major drug-metabolizing enzyme. These interactions could influence the pharmacokinetics of the molecule.
Step 5: Given the structure and the potential for interaction with GPCRs and enzymes, the related genes include: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
