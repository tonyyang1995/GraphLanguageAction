Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(O)CO, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string CC(O)CO corresponds to acetaminophen (paracetamol). It has a benzene ring with an attached para-aminophenol group and an ester linkage. This structure suggests that it could interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: Considering the genes listed, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are cytochrome P450 enzymes responsible for metabolizing various drugs, including acetaminophen. These enzymes play a crucial role in breaking down the para-aminophenol group, which is a key part of the acetaminophen structure.
Step 3: Another relevant gene is SLC6A4, which encodes the neurotransmitter transporter serotonin (5-HT), also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine. While not directly related to acetaminophen metabolism, it might be indirectly involved if the molecule affects serotonin levels due to its structural similarity to certain analgesics.
Step 4: The gene CYP3A4, which is another cytochrome P450 enzyme, may also be related as it metabolizes a wide range of substrates, potentially including acetaminophen. However, its primary role is in xenobiotic metabolism rather than direct drug metabolism.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the genes CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and SLC6A4 are likely to have a relationship with the molecule acetaminophen based on their functions in drug metabolism and neurotransmitter transport.
