Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cccc(N=c2cc[n-]cc2S(=O)(=O)[N-]C(=O)[NH2+]C(C)C)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with several aromatic rings and functional groups including a nitrile (-N#C), sulfonyl (-SO2), amide (-CONH2), and amidine (-NHC(=O)-) functionalities. These features suggest that the molecule could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction, neurotransmission, and enzymatic activities.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of an amidine group and amide functionalities are indicative of potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels, which are often regulated by neurotransmitters and hormones. This suggests possible relationships with genes encoding such receptors and channels.
Step 3: Among the provided genes, those encoding GPCRs like DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), HTR1A (Serotonin receptor 1A), HTR2A (Serotonin receptor 2A), and HRH1 (Histamine receptor H1) are likely to be relevant due to their roles in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a sulfonyl group may indicate interaction with enzymes such as those involved in drug metabolism, specifically CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and the potential interactions inferred, the related genes include: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HRH1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
