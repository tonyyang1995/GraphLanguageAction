Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1c([O-])c(-c2ccc([O-])cc2)oc2cc([O-])cc([O-])c12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex structure containing several functional groups such as an amide (N-C), an ester (O-C-O), and multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups. These functional groups are often involved in interactions with proteins, particularly enzymes and receptors, which are encoded by certain genes.
Step 2: The presence of a quinone-like moiety (O=C1C([O-])C(-c2ccc([O-])cc2)) suggests potential interactions with genes that encode enzymes involved in phase I and II metabolism, such as CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize quinone compounds.
Step 3: The molecule also contains multiple hydroxyl groups, which could interact with genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Specifically, the presence of these groups might suggest interactions with genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, and CHRM1, which encode adrenergic and cholinergic receptors.
Step 4: The overall structure hints at possible interaction with genes involved in signal transduction pathways, such as HRH1 (histamine H1 receptor) and HTR2A (serotonin 5-HT2A receptor), due to the presence of multiple polar functional groups that could participate in ligand binding and receptor activation.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule may be related to the following genes: CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, HRH1, and HTR2A.
