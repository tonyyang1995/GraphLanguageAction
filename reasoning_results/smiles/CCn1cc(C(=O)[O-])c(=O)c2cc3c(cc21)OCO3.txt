Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCn1cc(C(=O)[O-])c(=O)c2cc3c(cc21)OCO3, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring with substituents, including a nitro group (n), a cyano group (C(=O)[O-]), and an amide group (c(=O)c). This structure suggests it could interact with enzymes or receptors that are involved in metabolism or signal transduction.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (c(=O)c) indicates potential activity as a ligand for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) or other proteins that recognize such functional groups. GPCRs are often associated with neurotransmitter receptors, which are encoded by genes like DRD2 (Dopamine Receptor D2), HTR1A (Serotonin Receptor 1A), and others listed.
Step 3: The molecule also has a hydroxyl group (-OCO3) attached to a benzene ring, which might suggest it could interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP3A4.
Step 4: The overall structure, with its aromatic rings and functional groups, points towards a possible interaction with ion channels or transporters, as seen in the presence of KCNH2 (Potassium Voltage-Gated Channel Subfamily H Member 2) and SLC6A4 (Solute Carrier Family 6 Member 4).
Step 5: Based on the molecule’s structure and potential interactions, the related genes include: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, KCNH2, and SLC6A4. These genes encode proteins that are directly involved in receptor signaling and drug metabolism, which aligns with the functional groups present in the molecule. 
Summary of Related Genes: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, KCNH2, SLC6A4.
