Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N#Cc1ccc(CSc2n[n-]c(=NC(=O)c3ccc4ncsc4c3)s2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule provided has a complex structure, featuring a nitrogen atom triple-bonded to carbon (N#C), indicating it is likely an aromatic heterocyclic compound. This type of molecular structure often interacts with receptors and transporters located on cell membranes.
Step 2: Analyzing the pattern of the molecule further, there are multiple substitutions, including a cyano group (-CN) and a nitro group (-NO2), which are known for their ability to modulate protein-protein interactions and receptor binding activities. These functional groups can influence the interaction with various membrane-bound proteins.
Step 3: Considering the genetic receptors and transporters listed, the molecule's structural features suggest potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways. Specifically, the presence of substituents like -CN and -NO2 can affect the activity of receptors such as DRD2 (Dopamine D2 receptor), HTR2A (Serotonin 5-HT2A receptor), and HRH1 (Histamine H1 receptor).
Step 4: The molecule also contains a carboxamide group (-CONH2), which is characteristic of compounds that can act as inhibitors or agonists of ion channels and transporters. This could indicate potential interactions with genes encoding for ion channels and transporters, such as KCNH2 (Potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2), CACNA1H (Calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1H), and SLC6A4 (Solute carrier family 6 member 4, which encodes the serotonin transporter).
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and the above analysis, the genes most likely to be related to this molecule include those encoding for receptors and transporters, specifically:
- Dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2)
- Serotonin 5-HT2A receptor (HTR2A)
- Histamine H1 receptor (HRH1)
- Potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2 (KCNH2)
- Calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1H (CACNA1H)
- Solute carrier family 6 member 4 (SLC6A4)
