Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N=c1[n-]c(-c2ccccc2CO)nc(=NCc2ccccc2)[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic core, which is typical for many ligands that interact with receptors. This suggests that the molecule may have pharmacological activity, particularly if it binds to receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an ester group (CO) indicates that this molecule could act as a ligand for ion channels, transporters, or enzymes. These functional groups are often involved in binding to proteins such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), ion channels, and metabolic enzymes.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a benzene ring system, which is common in many drugs that interact with enzymes and receptors. Benzene rings can form stable interactions with protein binding sites through hydrogen bonding, pi stacking, and other non-covalent interactions.
Step 4: Given the structure and functional groups present, the molecule is likely to interact with receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmitter signaling, hormone regulation, and metabolism. Genes associated with these processes include HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and SLC6A4, among others.
Step 5: Additionally, the presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic core and a carboxylic acid group suggests potential interaction with GPCRs. Genes related to GPCR function include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, and ADRB2.
