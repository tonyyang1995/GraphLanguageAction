Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc(-c2ccccc2)n[n-]c1=NCC[NH+]1CCOCC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a negative charge and a positively charged nitrogen, suggesting it has potential for interacting with receptors that bind to ion channels or neurotransmitters. This pattern is relevant to genes encoding ion channel and neurotransmitter receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a phenyl ring and a nitro group (-NO2) indicates the molecule could interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP (cytochrome P450) genes.
Step 3: The presence of a pyrimidine ring and a carboxylic acid group suggests the molecule might interact with enzymes like HTRs (hormone and trace amine receptors), which are encoded by genes such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 4: The overall structure, including the presence of a benzene ring and a quinoline-like structure, could potentially interact with kinases and G-protein coupled receptors, which are encoded by genes like LCK, DRD2, and PTGS1.
Step 5: Given the above structural features, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, ESR1, FLT1, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KDR, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, PTGS1, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
