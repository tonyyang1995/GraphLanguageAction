Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCn1c(SCC(=O)c2ccccc2)nnc1-c1cccs1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple rings and functional groups such as a benzene ring, a nitrile group (-CN), and a carbonyl group (=O). The presence of these functional groups suggests that this molecule could interact with proteins involved in cellular signaling and metabolism.
Step 2: Notably, the molecule contains a nitrile group which is often found in compounds that can modulate the activity of enzymes and receptors. This structural feature might allow the molecule to act as an inhibitor or activator of certain enzymes or receptors.
Step 3: Given the diverse range of genes listed, we need to focus on those that are known to be influenced by small molecules with similar functional groups. For instance, CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) are known to metabolize a wide variety of drugs and xenobiotics, many of which contain nitrile or carbonyl groups. Therefore, our molecule could potentially interact with these enzymes, affecting their function.
Step 4: Additionally, some of the listed genes encode receptors that could interact directly with the molecule. For example, DRD2 (Dopamine Receptor D2), HTR1A (Serotonin Receptor 1A), and HTR2A (Serotonin Receptor 2A) are G-protein coupled receptors that can bind small molecules. The presence of a benzene ring and other hydrophobic groups in the molecule could facilitate its interaction with these receptors.
Step 5: Based on the structure and functional groups present in the molecule, it is likely to have interactions with CYP enzymes and serotonin receptors. Therefore, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A. 
Summary of related genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A.
