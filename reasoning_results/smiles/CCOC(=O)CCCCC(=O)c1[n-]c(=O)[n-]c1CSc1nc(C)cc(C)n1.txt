Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)CCCCC(=O)c1[n-]c(=O)[n-]c1CSc1nc(C)cc(C)n1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a core structure of a benzene ring with multiple substituents, including an amide group (-CO-) and a carboxyl group (-COOH), which are characteristic of drugs that can interact with receptors or enzymes. The presence of a nitrogen atom within a benzene ring (indicated by the "=O" next to the nitrogen) suggests it could be a heterocyclic compound, potentially interacting with ion channels or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 2: The molecule also includes a cyclic structure with a nitrogen atom that is negatively charged (indicated by "[n-]"), suggesting it might have electrophilic aromatic substitution capabilities, which could influence the activity of enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYPs). This is particularly relevant for CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which metabolize many drugs.
Step 3: The presence of a chiral center and a cyclic amine structure could indicate potential interactions with neurotransmitter receptors, such as D2-like dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), which are known to have amine binding sites.
Step 4: The overall structure hints at possible interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism and signaling pathways, such as CYP3A4, which is involved in the metabolism of numerous drugs, and PTGS1 (COX-1), which is involved in prostaglandin synthesis.
Step 5: Given the complex structure and potential interactions with enzymes and receptors, the most likely related genes are those involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and neurotransmission (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6). Additionally, genes involved in receptor function and signaling, such as PTGS1, may also be relevant.
