Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C=CS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N=c2nc(OCC3CCCCC3)c3[n-]cnc3[n-]2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)) which is characteristic of drugs that interact with enzymes and receptors involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring (C=CS) suggests potential interactions with proteins that have aromatic binding sites, such as certain G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring (N=c2nc(OCC3CCCCC3)c3[n-]cnc3[n-]2), which may indicate a possible interaction with receptors that bind ligands containing nitrogen, such as adrenergic and muscarinic receptors.
Step 4: Given the complex structure involving multiple functional groups, this molecule could potentially interact with several enzymes and receptors listed, including those involved in neurotransmitter metabolism and receptor activation.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and functional groups present, the molecule might be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
