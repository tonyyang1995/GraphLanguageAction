Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCC1(c2ccc(N)cc2)CCC(=O)NC1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that includes a benzene ring system, a pyrrole ring, and a carboxamide group. The presence of a benzene ring is common in many drug-like molecules due to its aromaticity and ability to participate in various interactions with proteins. The pyrrole ring suggests potential for hydrogen bonding and electron-donating properties. The carboxamide group can form hydrogen bonds and can be recognized by certain enzymes or receptors.
Step 2: Analyzing the pattern of the molecule, it appears to have a central core with substituents attached, which could indicate a ligand for a receptor or an enzyme. The presence of a nitrogen atom in the pyrrole ring might suggest a role in interacting with acidic or basic sites on proteins. Additionally, the presence of a carboxamide group indicates a potential for binding to ion channels or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: Considering the genes listed, those involved in neurotransmitter systems and signal transduction pathways are particularly relevant. GPCRs, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HRH1, are known to interact with ligands that have similar structural features to the described molecule, including aromatic rings, heteroaromatic rings, and polar functional groups.
Step 4: Furthermore, enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are part of the cytochrome P450 family, play a crucial role in the metabolism of many drugs. Given the presence of a benzene ring and a carboxamide group, this molecule might be metabolized by these enzymes, making them relevant to the molecule's pharmacological profile.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and the interaction patterns with proteins, the genes related to the molecule are likely to include: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HRH1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These genes encode proteins that may directly interact with or be involved in the metabolism of the molecule.
