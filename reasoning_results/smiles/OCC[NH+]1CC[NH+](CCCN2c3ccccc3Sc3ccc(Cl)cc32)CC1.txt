Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: OCC[NH+]1CC[NH+](CCCN2c3ccccc3Sc3ccc(Cl)cc32)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom that is positively charged, which is indicated by the "[NH+]" notation. This indicates the presence of an amine group that has lost a proton, making it a quaternary ammonium compound.
Step 2: The molecule also includes multiple aromatic rings, particularly benzene rings, which are common in many pharmaceuticals due to their stability and ability to form hydrogen bonds.
Step 3: The presence of a cyclic nitro group (N=O) within the molecule could indicate potential for interaction with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP), which are listed in the provided gene list.
Step 4: Given the complexity and presence of functional groups like amine and nitro, this molecule might interact with receptors and ion channels, which are encoded by genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CACNA1H, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, LCK, and KDR.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule's structure may influence its ability to modulate G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are involved in signal transduction pathways. Genes associated with these receptors include HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
