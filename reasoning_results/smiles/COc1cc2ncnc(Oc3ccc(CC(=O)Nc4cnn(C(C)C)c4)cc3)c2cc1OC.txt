Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc2ncnc(Oc3ccc(CC(=O)Nc4cnn(C(C)C)c4)cc3)c2cc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a complex structure with multiple rings, including a benzene ring, a pyrrole ring, and a furan ring. It also includes an oxygen atom that forms part of a hydroxyl group (-OH), and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This structure suggests the molecule could be a drug-like compound, potentially interacting with receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: Looking at the genetic features, several genes are involved in drug metabolism and response. CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 are all members of the cytochrome P450 family, which play a crucial role in metabolizing many drugs. The presence of a carboxylic acid group in the molecule might indicate it is a substrate for these enzymes.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule's structure may interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are encoded by genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These receptors are known to bind various ligands, including small molecules with aromatic and heterocyclic structures, similar to the molecule's pattern.
Step 4: The presence of a benzene ring and a pyrrole ring, along with the hydroxyl group, might suggest potential interactions with genes involved in calcium channel activity, such as CACNA1H, or with genes related to receptor activity modulators, such as SIGMAR1.
Step 5: Based on the structural features of the molecule, the following genes are likely to be related: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CACNA1H, and SIGMAR1. These genes are involved in drug metabolism, receptor binding, and modulation of neuronal signaling pathways.
