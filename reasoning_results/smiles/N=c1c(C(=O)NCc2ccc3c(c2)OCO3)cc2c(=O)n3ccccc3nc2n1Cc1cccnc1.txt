Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N=c1c(C(=O)NCc2ccc3c(c2)OCO3)cc2c(=O)n3ccccc3nc2n1Cc1cccnc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a nitrogen atom in a ring (N), which is part of an imidazole ring, and several aromatic rings. The presence of an imidazole ring and aromatic rings suggests the molecule may interact with proteins that have similar structural motifs, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 2: The molecule also contains a benzene ring system with oxygen-containing functional groups (such as esters and amides). These functional groups can form hydrogen bonds and other interactions with amino acid residues in protein binding sites, particularly those involved in ligand-receptor interactions.
Step 3: The pattern of the molecule, including its hydrophobic and polar regions, could potentially fit into binding pockets of certain enzymes or receptors. For instance, the benzene rings might align with the hydrophobic core of a protein, while the amide and ester groups could participate in hydrogen bonding.
Step 4: Given the structural features, the molecule might be capable of interacting with receptors or enzymes associated with neurotransmitter systems, inflammation, or drug metabolism. This is because the identified features are commonly found in molecules that interact with these biological processes.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is most likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, ESR1, PTGS1, and SLC6A4. These genes encode proteins involved in neurotransmitter signaling, drug metabolism, and inflammatory responses. The molecule's potential interactions with these genes highlight its possible role in modulating physiological processes through these pathways.
