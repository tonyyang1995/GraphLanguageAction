Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)c1cncn1C(C)c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule has a benzene ring attached to an oxazole ring, which is characteristic of several drug classes including some that interact with receptors such as adrenergic and muscarinic receptors. This structural feature suggests potential interactions with genes encoding these receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a pyrrole ring and a phenyl ring connected to a quinoline ring is indicative of molecules that may interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP enzymes. This is relevant for genes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
Step 3: The molecule contains a lactam and a carboxamide group, which are common in molecules that bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This could imply interactions with genes encoding GPCRs, such as DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C.
Step 4: The presence of a benzene ring with a cyano group (-CN) attached is characteristic of molecules that can act as inhibitors or modulators of ion channels, which could relate to genes like KCNH2.
Step 5: Given the diverse functional groups and the overall structure, the molecule is likely to interact with multiple genes, particularly those involved in drug metabolism (CYP enzymes), neurotransmission (GPCRs and ion channels), and receptor signaling pathways.
