Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc2ncc(S(=O)(=O)c3ccccc3)c(N3CCCC(C)C3)c2cc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that includes a benzene ring system, a nitro group (-NO2), an ester group (C(=O)O), and a thioester group (S(=O)(=O)). These structural elements suggest potential interactions with enzymes and receptors involved in signal transduction and metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of the nitro group (-NO2) and the ester/thioester functionalities could indicate a role in modulating enzyme activity, particularly those involved in phase I and II biotransformation pathways. CYP enzymes, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, are known to metabolize various xenobiotics, including drugs and environmental toxins, which might be influenced by this molecule.
Step 3: Given the complexity of the molecule, it also suggests potential receptor binding capabilities, especially for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). The molecule's size and functional groups could interact with GPCRs like HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are implicated in neurotransmission and neuropsychiatric disorders.
Step 4: The molecule's ability to interact with enzymes and receptors points towards its potential impact on signaling pathways and cellular functions regulated by these proteins. This could affect genes involved in neurotransmission, such as DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, and HTR6, which are part of the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems.
Step 5: Considering the molecule's structural complexity and the potential for both enzymatic modulation and receptor binding, it is most likely to have a relationship with a few key genes rather than being specifically related to one gene. The related genes include:
- CYP1A2
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP3A4
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- HTR6
- DRD2
- DRD3
- DRD4
These genes are involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmission, respectively.
