Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C1C(SCCO)=C(SCCO)C(=O)c2ccccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule provided has a complex structure containing multiple rings and functional groups such as carbonyl (C=O), sulfonyl (S=O), and aromatic rings. This structure suggests it could interact with proteins involved in various cellular processes including metabolism, signaling, and transport.
Step 2: The presence of the sulfonyl group (-SO2-) and the aromatic ring system indicates this molecule might have potential for binding to receptors or enzymes that recognize similar functional groups. Sulfonyl-containing molecules are known to bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other ion channels.
Step 3: Among the listed genes, several are associated with GPCRs, which are membrane receptors that play crucial roles in signal transduction pathways. These include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes encode for adrenergic and cholinergic receptors, as well as serotonin receptors, all of which can potentially interact with a molecule possessing a sulfonyl group.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule’s structure may also be relevant to CYP enzymes, particularly CYP2C19, given its ability to metabolize substrates through oxidation reactions involving oxygen and hydroxyl groups. CYP2C19 is known to metabolize many drugs and xenobiotics, and its activity can influence drug efficacy and toxicity.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C19.
The molecule appears to be related to GPCRs and CYP enzymes based on its chemical structure and potential interactions with these protein classes. The related genes are primarily those encoding GPCRs and CYP2C19.
