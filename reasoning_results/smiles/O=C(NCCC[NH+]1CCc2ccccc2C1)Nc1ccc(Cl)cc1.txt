Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(NCCC[NH+]1CCc2ccccc2C1)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure that includes a central double-bonded carbon (C=O) and multiple nitrogen atoms, including one positively charged nitrogen (N+). This structure suggests it could be a potential ligand for receptors or enzymes that interact with nitrogen-containing compounds or aromatic rings.
Step 2: The molecule contains a benzene ring (c2ccccc2) and a pyrrole-like structure (NCCC), which are common motifs found in ligands for various receptor types, particularly G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels.
Step 3: The presence of the positively charged nitrogen (N+) and the overall molecular shape might allow this compound to interact with cation-binding sites of certain GPCRs or ion channels, which are often involved in neurotransmitter or hormone signaling pathways.
Step 4: Considering the pattern of the molecule and its potential interactions, it is likely to affect receptors and enzymes associated with neurotransmission and signal transduction. Genes such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which encode for various subtypes of serotonin and dopamine receptors, could be directly influenced by this molecule.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule’s structure may also interact with CYP enzymes, specifically CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, due to their ability to metabolize aromatic compounds and nitrogen-containing heterocycles.
