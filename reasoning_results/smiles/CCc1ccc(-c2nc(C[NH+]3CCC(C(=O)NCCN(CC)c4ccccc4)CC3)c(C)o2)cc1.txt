Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCc1ccc(-c2nc(C[NH+]3CCC(C(=O)NCCN(CC)c4ccccc4)CC3)c(C)o2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with multiple functional groups including aromatic rings, amide bonds, and a heterocyclic nitrogen. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes and receptors that are involved in signal transduction pathways, drug metabolism, and neurotransmission.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-CO-NH-) and a heterocyclic nitrogen in the molecule indicates it could interact with proteins containing similar functional groups, such as kinases and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). These types of molecules are often targeted by drugs due to their role in various physiological processes.
Step 3: Considering the pattern of the molecule, it may have potential interactions with genes encoding for enzymes like CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs. The molecule's structure could also suggest interactions with receptors such as DRD2, HTR2A, and HTR2B, which are associated with neurotransmitter systems.
Step 4: The molecule's aromatic rings and overall structure might indicate it could interact with ion channels, such as KCNH2, or receptors that modulate ion fluxes, like HRH1, which is involved in histamine signaling.
Step 5: Based on the structure and potential interactions, the genes most likely to be related to this molecule are: CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, KCNH2, HRH1.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
- DRD2
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- KCNH2
- HRH1
These genes encode proteins that may interact directly or indirectly with the described molecular structure. Further experimental validation would be necessary to confirm these relationships.
