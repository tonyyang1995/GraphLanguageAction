Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [O-]c1cc2c(cc1[O-])C[NH+](C(=S)[NH2+]CCc1ccc(Cl)cc1)CCC2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains multiple functional groups such as an amine (-NH2), a sulfonamide (N=SC(=O)-), and a carboxylate (-COO-). These functional groups are often involved in binding to proteins and can interact with receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and a quinoline-like structure suggests potential interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP), particularly CYP2D6 and CYP2C9, which metabolize drugs containing similar structures.
Step 3: The molecule also has a pyrimidine ring, which is known to interact with certain receptor proteins, potentially influencing genes like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which encode dopamine receptors.
Step 4: The presence of a thiazole ring and a sulfide (-S-) could indicate interactions with enzymes or receptors that have a preference for sulfur-containing compounds, possibly involving genes like CYP2C19.
Step 5: Given the complex structure and the presence of functional groups that can interact with enzymes and receptors, the molecule is likely related to the following genes: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4. 
Summary of Related Genes: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
