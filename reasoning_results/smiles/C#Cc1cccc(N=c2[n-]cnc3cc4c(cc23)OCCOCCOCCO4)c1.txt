Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C#Cc1cccc(N=c2[n-]cnc3cc4c(cc23)OCCOCCOCCO4)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a quinoline-like structure with a nitrogen atom that is part of an aromatic ring system and is also involved in a double bond (C#Cc1). This structure is known to interact with various receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The molecule contains a nitro group (-N=) attached to a benzene ring, which is often involved in interactions with receptors such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes like cytochrome P450 (CYP) family members.
Step 3: The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups (-O-) in the molecule suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, particularly those belonging to the CYP family, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4.
Step 4: Given the presence of a benzene ring and the nitro group, this molecule could potentially interact with GPCRs like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are known to have binding sites for ligands containing aromatic rings and electron-withdrawing groups.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure, the related genes include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C.
