Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccccc1OCCCC(=O)NCc1ccco1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains an aromatic ring system with a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to a benzene ring, and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at one end. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism and receptors that bind to ligands.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylic acid group indicates the molecule could interact with ion channels or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) which often have acidic residues for ligand binding. Additionally, the aromatic rings may interact with proteins through π-π stacking or hydrogen bonding.
Step 3: The molecule's structure aligns well with known ligands for GPCRs such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4). These receptors are involved in various physiological processes including neurotransmission and hormone regulation.
Step 4: The carboxylic acid group could also interact with enzymes like CYP2D6, which metabolizes drugs and other xenobiotics, and CYP3A4, another major drug-metabolizing enzyme. Such interactions might affect the activity of these enzymes.
Step 5: Given the molecule’s structure, it is likely to interact with receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and hormone signaling, suggesting a possible relationship with DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes encode for receptors that are crucial for regulating mood, cognition, and pain perception.
Summary of related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
