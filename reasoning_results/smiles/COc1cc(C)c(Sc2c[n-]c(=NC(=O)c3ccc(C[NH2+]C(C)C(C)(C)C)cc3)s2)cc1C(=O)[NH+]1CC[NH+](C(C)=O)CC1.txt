Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc(C)c(Sc2c[n-]c(=NC(=O)c3ccc(C[NH2+]C(C)C(C)(C)C)cc3)s2)cc1C(=O)[NH+]1CC[NH+](C(C)=O)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule contains multiple functional groups including an amide, a benzene ring, and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle. These structural elements are often found in ligands that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are known to be regulated by certain genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an amine (-NH2) suggests potential for interaction with enzymes like CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, which metabolize various drugs and endogenous substances. This indicates a possible relationship with CYP2C19 and CYP2D6.
Step 3: The molecule also has a quinoline-like structure, which is characteristic of compounds that may interact with receptors such as HRH1, which is involved in histamine signaling. Therefore, HRH1 could be a relevant gene.
Step 4: The presence of a benzene ring with a substituent containing a nitro group (NO2) might indicate interactions with enzymes like CYP1A2, which metabolizes compounds with aromatic rings and functional groups like nitro.
Step 5: Given the overall complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, this molecule likely interacts with multiple receptors and enzymes, making it potentially related to several of the listed genes, particularly those involved in neurotransmission, receptor binding, and drug metabolism.
Summary of related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HRH1, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP1A2. 
Note: The exact relationships would require further biochemical and pharmacological studies to confirm. The list above is based on the structural features of the molecule and their potential interactions with known biological targets.
