Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCS(=O)(=O)[NH+]1CCCC(C(=O)NCC[NH+]2CCOCC2)C1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple functional groups such as amide, carboxylic acid, and amine. It also has a cyclic structure with benzene rings and alkyl chains. This structure suggests that the molecule may interact with proteins involved in signal transduction, receptor binding, or transport processes.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-CO-NH-) and carboxylic acid group (-COOH) indicates potential interactions with receptors or enzymes that have corresponding binding sites. These functional groups are common in ligands that bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are encoded by genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 3: The cyclic structure and alkyl chains suggest that the molecule could be a substrate for enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These cytochrome P450 enzymes play a crucial role in drug metabolism.
Step 4: The molecule's structure also implies possible interactions with ion channels, such as those encoded by KCNH2, which is involved in cardiac repolarization. Additionally, the presence of a carboxylic acid group could suggest interactions with voltage-gated calcium channels, like CACNA1H.
Step 5: Given the above considerations, the molecule may be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, KCNH2, and CACNA1H. These genes encode proteins that are involved in various physiological processes, including neurotransmission, ion channel function, and drug metabolism. Step 6:
