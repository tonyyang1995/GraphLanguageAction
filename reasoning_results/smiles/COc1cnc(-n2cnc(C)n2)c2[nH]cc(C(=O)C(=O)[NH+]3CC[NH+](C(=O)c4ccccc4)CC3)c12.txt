Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cnc(-n2cnc(C)n2)c2[nH]cc(C(=O)C(=O)[NH+]3CC[NH+](C(=O)c4ccccc4)CC3)c12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a tricyclic structure, which includes a benzene ring, a pyrrole ring, and a furan ring. This structure suggests potential interactions with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), as many ligands for these receptors have similar cyclic structures.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-CONH-) in the molecule indicates that it could interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize many drugs via oxidative processes.
Step 3: The molecule also has a quaternary ammonium group (-N+(CH3)3), which is commonly found in agonists of various receptors, including muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (MChRs). This suggests potential interactions with genes encoding MChRs, such as CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 4: The molecule's structure includes a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an ester group (-COOC-), which could indicate its ability to interact with ion channels and other membrane proteins. This might be relevant to genes like KCNH2, which encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel.
Step 5: Given the complexity of the molecule and its potential interactions with various receptor types and metabolic pathways, it is likely to have effects on multiple genes, but the most probable ones are those related to GPCRs, enzymes involved in drug metabolism, and ion channels. Therefore, the related genes include: ABL1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, ESR1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, and SIGMAR1. The summary of related gene names is as follows:
- GPCRs: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- Metabolism: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4
- Ion channels: KCNH2
- Other: ABL1, ESR1, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, SIGMAR1
