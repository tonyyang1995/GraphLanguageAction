Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCC1(C)CC(=O)NC1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string CCC1(C)CC(=O)NC1=O is an acyl heterocyclic compound, specifically an amide derivative. It contains a benzene ring (indicated by "CCC1(C)CC"), an amide group (-CONH), and a hydroxyl group (-OH).
Step 2: The presence of the amide group suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These enzymes are responsible for the oxidation of various substrates, including amides.
Step 3: The hydroxyl group could interact with proteins that have hydrophobic binding sites, potentially affecting proteins like HRH1 and PTGS1, which are involved in G-protein coupled receptor signaling and prostaglandin synthesis, respectively.
Step 4: Given the aromatic nature of the molecule, it might also interact with ion channels, such as KCNH2, which encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and functional groups, the molecule may be related to genes encoding neurotransmitter receptors, particularly HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which encode serotonin receptors, as well as DRD2, which encodes a dopamine receptor.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HRH1, PTGS1, KCNH2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2. Step 1: The molecule is an acyl heterocyclic compound containing a benzene ring, an amide group, and a hydroxyl group.
Step 2: Potential interactions with CYP enzymes suggest a relation to CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 3: The hydroxyl group may interact with HRH1 and PTGS1.
Step 4: The aromatic nature could relate to KCNH2.
Step 5: Neurotransmitter receptor interactions may involve HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and DRD2.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HRH1, PTGS1, KCNH2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2.
