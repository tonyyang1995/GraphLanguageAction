Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [NH3+]CCCC[NH3+], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string [NH3+]CCCC[NH3+] is an amine-containing compound with four methyl groups attached to a central carbon atom. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins that have amine binding sites or are involved in signaling pathways modulated by amines.
Step 2: The presence of multiple amine groups ([NH3+]) could indicate the molecule might interact with receptors or enzymes that recognize or bind to amines, such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 3: The molecule's structure does not directly suggest interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which typically metabolize drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 4: Given the amine groups and the overall structure, there is no clear indication that this molecule would directly interact with genes like EGFR, PTGS1, or other genes involved in receptor tyrosine kinase activity or prostaglandin synthesis.
Step 5: The molecule’s structure does not provide strong evidence for direct interaction with G-protein coupled receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1) or ion channels (KCNH2, KDR, CACNA1H).
Summary of related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4. These genes encode receptors that may have binding sites for amines similar to those present in the given molecule.
