Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [NH3+]CCCC(=O)[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule given, [NH3+]CCCC(=O)[O-], is a positively charged amine attached to an aromatic ring with a ketone group. This structure is reminiscent of acetylcholine (ACh), which is a neurotransmitter that binds to nicotinic and muscarinic receptors.
Step 2: The structure of this molecule suggests potential interaction with cholinergic systems, particularly with muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs). Muscarinic receptors are involved in various physiological processes and are encoded by several genes such as CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 3: The presence of the ketone group could also indicate potential interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes, specifically CYP2D6, which is known to metabolize many drugs including some that interact with muscarinic receptors.
Step 4: Furthermore, the positively charged nature of the molecule might allow it to bind to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) like the serotonin receptors (HTRs) such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are involved in mood regulation and other neurological functions.
Step 5: Given the molecular structure and its potential to interact with both muscarinic receptors and serotonin receptors, the related genes include: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2D6, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C.
Summary of related genes: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2D6, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C. Step 1: The molecule given, [NH3+]CCCC(=O)[O-], is a positively charged amine attached to an aromatic ring with a ketone group.
