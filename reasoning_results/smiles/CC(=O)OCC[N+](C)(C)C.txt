Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(=O)OCC[N+](C)(C)C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a chemical compound with the SMILES string "CC(=O)OCC[N+](C)(C)C". This represents an acetic acid derivative with a positively charged nitrogen atom, suggesting it might be an amine or amide with a quaternary ammonium salt.
Step 2: Analyzing the structure, we see that the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which is characteristic of drugs targeting receptors or enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or enzymes like CYP enzymes that are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: Given the presence of a positively charged nitrogen, this could indicate a potential interaction with negatively charged sites on proteins, such as ion channels or transporters. This feature is relevant for genes encoding proteins with charged residues that could interact with the molecule.
Step 4: Considering the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the most likely related genes would be those encoding receptors or enzymes that might interact directly or indirectly with this type of molecule. Genes encoding GPCRs and CYP enzymes are particularly relevant due to their roles in signal transduction and metabolism.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and PTGS1.
