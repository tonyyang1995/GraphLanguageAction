Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(NC(=O)[NH+](C2CCCCC2)C(C)c2cccnc2)c(OC)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring system (indicated by the 'N' in the SMILES string), which is characteristic of many ligands that interact with receptors. This pattern suggests potential interaction with genes encoding receptors.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-CONH2) indicates the molecule could be an inhibitor or agonist for enzymes or receptors that have such functional groups, like kinases or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The molecule also includes a phenolic group (-OH) and a benzene ring, which are common in drugs targeting enzymes involved in metabolism pathways, such as CYP enzymes.
Step 4: Considering the molecular structure, it has the potential to interact with multiple types of receptors and enzymes, but based on the provided genes, the most likely candidates are those involved in neurotransmitter systems and drug metabolism due to the presence of functional groups that can bind to these targets.
Step 5: Based on the analysis, the most relevant genes are those involved in neurotransmitter signaling and drug metabolism, specifically: CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and SLC6A4.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C19
