Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C(=O)[O-])c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c1ccc(Cl)cc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring with substituents, a carboxyl group, and a negatively charged oxygen atom. This structure suggests potential interactions with membrane receptors and enzymes due to its hydrophobic and polar regions.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxyl group (-COOH) indicates the molecule could be an inhibitor or activator of enzymes that metabolize drugs, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These cytochrome P450 enzymes are involved in the metabolism of many drugs, and their activity can be modulated by various compounds.
Step 3: The aromatic ring system and the amine group (-NH) suggest possible interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are often targeted by drugs affecting neurotransmission. This could relate to genes encoding receptors like DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, all of which are involved in serotonin and dopamine signaling pathways.
Step 4: Given the presence of chlorine atoms and the overall molecular structure, the compound might interact with ion channels, particularly those involved in sodium or calcium regulation. This could link to genes like KCNH2, which encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel.
Step 5: Considering the overall complexity and the potential for multiple binding sites, this molecule could have diverse effects on various genes involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmission, and receptor function.
