Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(-n2nc(C(F)(F)F)cc2-c2ccc(Cl)cc2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a tricyclic core structure, which is common in many ligands that interact with receptors. The tricyclic core is likely to be involved in binding to a receptor, possibly a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) given the presence of multiple aromatic rings.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a fluorinated phenyl ring and a cyano group, both of which are known to enhance the lipophilicity and pharmacokinetic properties of molecules. These groups could play a role in the molecule's ability to cross cell membranes and reach its target site within the body.
Step 3: The presence of a nitrile group (-CN) in the molecule suggests potential for metabolic reactions involving enzymes such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are known to metabolize compounds containing this functional group.
Step 4: Given the structure and functional groups present, the molecule is likely to interact with several GPCRs. Specific receptors that might be affected include DRD2 (Dopamine D2 receptor), HTR2A (Serotonin 5-HT2A receptor), and HRH1 (Histamine H1 receptor).
Step 5: The molecule may also influence the expression or function of other genes involved in signal transduction pathways, such as those encoding kinases like LCK and PTGS1 (COX-2), which are involved in inflammatory responses.
Related Gene Names:
- DRD2
- HTR2A
- HRH1
- LCK
- PTGS1 Step 1: The molecule has a tricyclic core structure, which is characteristic of many ligands that bind to receptors. This core structure is likely to interact directly with a receptor.
Step 2: The molecule contains fluorinated phenyl rings and a cyano group, which increase its lipophilicity and improve its ability to cross cell membranes and reach its target site.
Step 3: The presence of a nitrile group suggests the molecule may be metabolized by enzymes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19.
Step 4: Given the structure, the molecule is likely to interact with GPCRs, specifically DRD2, HTR2A, and HRH1.
Step 5: The molecule may also affect signaling pathways involving kinases such as LCK and PTGS1.
- PTGS1
These genes are likely to be influenced by the molecule due to its structural features and potential interactions. The summary focuses on the key genes that could be affected based on the molecule's chemical structure.
