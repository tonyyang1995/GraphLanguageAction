Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)[NH+]1CCC(NC(=O)CCC(=O)N2CC(C)Oc3ccc(C)cc32)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system attached to an amide group, which is characteristic of many drug molecules that interact with receptors and transport proteins.
Step 2: The presence of an amide (CONH) and a carboxylic acid (COOH) group suggests potential for interaction with ion channels and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), given their roles in ligand binding and signal transduction.
Step 3: The aromatic ring system could potentially interact with various receptors, including those involved in neurotransmission such as adrenergic (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and cholinergic (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4) receptors.
Step 4: The presence of an ester (COOR) in the molecule may indicate its ability to modulate enzymes like CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize drugs.
Step 5: Given the complex structure with multiple functional groups, this molecule might also have affinity for receptors and enzymes involved in signaling pathways, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and CYP3A4.
Summary of related gene names:

Note: The gene CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6 are mentioned, but only CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 are listed in the summary due to repetition. Similarly, KDR and LCK are not included as they do not seem directly related based on the molecule's structure. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with a benzene ring, amide, and carboxylic acid groups, which are common in drug molecules.
Step 2: The amide and carboxylic acid groups suggest potential interactions with receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and metabolism.
Step 3: The aromatic ring system indicates possible binding to adrenergic and cholinergic receptors, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 4: The presence of a carboxylic acid group could influence enzyme activity, particularly those involved in drug metabolism like CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
Step 5: The overall structure hints at potential interactions with receptors and enzymes involved in signaling pathways, including HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
