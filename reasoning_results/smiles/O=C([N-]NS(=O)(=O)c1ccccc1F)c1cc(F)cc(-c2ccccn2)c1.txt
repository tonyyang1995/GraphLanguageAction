Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([N-]NS(=O)(=O)c1ccccc1F)c1cc(F)cc(-c2ccccn2)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound that includes elements such as oxygen (O), carbon (C), nitrogen (N), fluorine (F), and sulfur (S). It has a central part of the molecule that contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to a benzene ring, which is characteristic of molecules that can interact with various receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) and a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) suggests that this molecule may have specific interactions with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, particularly those containing cysteine residues due to their ability to form disulfide bonds and participate in redox reactions.
Step 3: The molecule also contains an amide group (-CONH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which are functional groups that can participate in hydrogen bonding and other types of molecular interactions, potentially affecting the activity of enzymes and receptors.
Step 4: Given the presence of these functional groups and the overall structure, this molecule could interact with genes encoding for enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are known to be involved in the metabolism of many drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule might interact with receptors and ion channels encoded by genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, HRH1, and HTR2A, as the presence of aromatic rings and functional groups can modulate the activity of these proteins through direct binding or allosteric modulation.
