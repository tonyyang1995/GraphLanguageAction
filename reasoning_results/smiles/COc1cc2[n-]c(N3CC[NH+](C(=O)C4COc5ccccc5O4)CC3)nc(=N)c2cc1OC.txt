Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc2[n-]c(N3CC[NH+](C(=O)C4COc5ccccc5O4)CC3)nc(=N)c2cc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure including a pyrrole ring system, a quinoline ring, and several functional groups such as amide, ester, and carbamate functionalities. This complexity suggests that it could interact with multiple biological targets.
Step 2: Analyzing the potential interactions, the molecule contains a quinoline moiety which is known to be involved in binding to various receptors and enzymes. Quinoline derivatives have been shown to modulate the activity of several genes and proteins, particularly those involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways.
Step 3: The presence of an amide group and a carbamate functionality indicates potential for modulating receptor proteins, especially G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are associated with several genes listed, including HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 4: The overall structure also suggests possible interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, due to its aromatic and heterocyclic nature. These enzymes play crucial roles in drug metabolism.
Step 5: Considering the diverse functional groups and structural motifs, the molecule is likely to interact with multiple genes and proteins. However, based on the analysis, the most relevant genes are those involved in neurotransmission (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4) and drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6).
