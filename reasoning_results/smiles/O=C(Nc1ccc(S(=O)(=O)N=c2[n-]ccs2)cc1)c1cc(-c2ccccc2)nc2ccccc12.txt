Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Nc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)N=c2[n-]ccs2)cc1)c1cc(-c2ccccc2)nc2ccccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrile group (-CN), an amide (-CONH-), and a sulfonamide (-SO2NH-) moiety. These functional groups suggest potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring with a nitro group (-NO2) and a sulfonyl group (-SO3-) indicates a possible interaction with enzymes that metabolize drugs containing aromatic and heteroaromatic systems.
Step 3: The molecule includes a pyrrolidine ring, which could interact with receptors or transporters involved in neurotransmission, such as those encoded by genes related to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule, including its size and functional groups, suggests it might be a substrate for CYP enzymes, particularly CYP2D6 and CYP2C9, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs.
Step 5: Given the potential interactions with CYP enzymes and the presence of functional groups that could bind to receptor sites, the molecule may be related to the following genes: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, SLC6A2, SLC6A4. Step 5: Related Gene Names: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
