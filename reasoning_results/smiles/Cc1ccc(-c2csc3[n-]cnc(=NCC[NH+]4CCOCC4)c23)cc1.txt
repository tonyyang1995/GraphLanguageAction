Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(-c2csc3[n-]cnc(=NCC[NH+]4CCOCC4)c23)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule provided is a complex organic compound with multiple rings and functional groups. It contains aromatic rings (benzene-like structures), a thiophene ring, a pyridine ring, and several nitrogen-containing heterocycles such as pyrrole and pyrazole. These structural features suggest that the molecule may interact with proteins involved in signal transduction, neurotransmission, or drug metabolism.
Step 2: Considering the presence of a quinolone-like structure (pyrazole ring fused to a benzene ring), this type of moiety is often found in drugs that target enzymes involved in the metabolism of neurotransmitters or other biological processes. This could indicate a potential interaction with enzymes like CYP2D6, which is known to metabolize many drugs including those affecting neurotransmitter levels.
Step 3: The presence of a pyridine ring and amide groups might also suggest interactions with ion channels or receptors that have similar functional groups in their binding sites. For instance, the HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A) and HTR2B (serotonin receptor 2B) are G-protein coupled receptors that bind various ligands including amides and contain pyridine-like structures in their binding pockets.
Step 4: The thiophene ring and the overall structure of the molecule might also be relevant to enzymes or receptors that recognize sulfur-containing compounds or have specific binding sites for heterocyclic molecules. CYP2C9, which is involved in the metabolism of various drugs, could potentially interact with this molecule due to its sulfur-containing heterocyclic nature.
Step 5: Given the complexity and specific structural features of the molecule, it is likely to interact with multiple genes, but the most probable ones based on the described structure are CYP2D6, CYP2C9, HTR2A, HTR2B, and CYP2C19.
Summary of Related Gene Names:
- CYP2D6
- CYP2C9
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- CYP2C19
These genes are primarily involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmitter signaling, which aligns with the complex structure and functional groups present in the molecule.
