Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C=CCN=c1[n-]c(N)c(C(=O)c2ccc(Cl)s2)s1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a double bond (C=CC) and an amine group (-N), suggesting it may interact with proteins that have binding sites for aromatic amines.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring (-n-) and a carboxylic acid group (C(=O)c2ccc(Cl)s2) indicates potential interactions with enzymes and receptors that recognize acidic or basic functional groups.
Step 3: The molecule includes a quinoline-like structure (c1[n-]c(N)c(C(=O)c2ccc(Cl)s2)s1), which could be relevant to enzymes involved in drug metabolism such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19.
Step 4: The structure also has a tricyclic pattern, which might be recognized by receptors like DRD2 and HTR2A, known to bind tricyclic antidepressants.
Step 5: Given the identified features, the molecule is likely related to the genes CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A, and HTR2B. 
Related Gene Names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a double bond (C=CC) and an amine group (-N), suggesting it may interact with proteins that have binding sites for aromatic amines.
