Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C=CCN=c1[n-]c(-c2ccc(Cl)cc2)cs1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a benzene ring with an amide group attached to it, which is typical for many ligands that interact with receptors such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This pattern suggests potential interactions with genes encoding for GPCRs.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule, particularly in a charged state (-), indicates the possibility of forming hydrogen bonds or other electrostatic interactions, which are common in receptor-ligand binding, especially for genes involved in neurotransmission.
Step 3: The molecule contains a cyano group (-CN), which can act as a functional group that binds to enzymes such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. This could be relevant to genes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule, including its size and shape, may allow it to fit into the active site of certain enzymes or receptors. This could be particularly relevant for genes involved in signaling pathways, such as those encoding for kinases (e.g., LCK).
Step 5: Given the molecular features described, the most likely related genes are those involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways, as well as those involved in drug metabolism. The related gene names are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, CNR1, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KDR, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, and CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6.
