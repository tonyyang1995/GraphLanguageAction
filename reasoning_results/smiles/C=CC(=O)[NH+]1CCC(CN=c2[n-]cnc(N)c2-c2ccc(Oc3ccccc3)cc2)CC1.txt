Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C=CC(=O)[NH+]1CCC(CN=c2[n-]cnc(N)c2-c2ccc(Oc3ccccc3)cc2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring with multiple substituents, including an amide group (-CO-NH), a pyrrolidine ring, and a quinoline ring. The presence of these structural elements suggests that the molecule may interact with proteins involved in neurotransmission, signaling pathways, and metabolism.
Step 2: The amide group (-CO-NH) in the molecule is a common functional group found in many neurotransmitters and neuroactive drugs, which can potentially bind to receptors such as adrenergic (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and serotonergic (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) receptors, influencing their activity.
Step 3: The quinoline ring in the molecule could suggest potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). These enzymes play a crucial role in the biotransformation of drugs, and their activities can be influenced by the presence of certain chemical structures like quinolines.
Step 4: Given the complexity of the molecule and its potential interactions with neurotransmitter receptors and metabolic enzymes, it is also possible that the molecule could affect G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) involved in various signaling pathways, such as dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 5: Based on the analysis of the molecule's structure and potential interactions, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4. 
Summary of related genes:
- ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4
- DRD2, DRD3, DRD4
- CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4
Note: The remaining genes listed are not directly related based on the molecule's structure and the reasoning provided. However, if more detailed information about the molecule's biological activity were available, additional relationships might be discovered.
