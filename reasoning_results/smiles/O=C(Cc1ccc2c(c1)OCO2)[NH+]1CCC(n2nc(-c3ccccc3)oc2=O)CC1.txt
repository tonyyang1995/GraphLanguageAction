Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Cc1ccc2c(c1)OCO2)[NH+]1CCC(n2nc(-c3ccccc3)oc2=O)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring system, which is part of the ABL1 gene product. ABL1 encodes the Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 protein, which is involved in signal transduction pathways that regulate cell growth and differentiation. The presence of this structural feature suggests a potential interaction with ABL1.
Step 2: The molecule also has a naphthylamine moiety, which could potentially interact with CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 genes. These genes encode cytochrome P450 enzymes that are involved in the metabolism of various drugs and xenobiotics. The naphthylamine group is known to be metabolized by these enzymes, indicating possible pharmacokinetic interactions.
Step 3: The molecule includes an indole ring, which is found in the CYP2D6 gene product. CYP2D6 is another member of the cytochrome P450 family, and it plays a crucial role in the metabolism of many drugs. The presence of an indole ring suggests that this molecule may be metabolized by CYP2D6, leading to potential drug-drug interactions.
Step 4: The molecule possesses a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group, which might interact with the PTGS1 gene (encoding COX-1). PTGS1 is involved in prostaglandin biosynthesis, and its inhibition is associated with anti-inflammatory effects. The carboxylic acid group could potentially bind to the active site of the enzyme, affecting its function.
Step 5: Lastly, the molecule contains a pyridine ring, which is relevant to the CYP1A2 gene. CYP1A2 is a member of the cytochrome P450 family and is involved in the metabolism of various drugs and environmental chemicals. The pyridine ring in the molecule could lead to metabolic interactions with CYP1A2.
Summary of related gene names:
- ABL1
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- PTGS1
- CYP1A2
These genes are involved in various biological processes such as signal transduction, drug metabolism, and prostaglandin biosynthesis, which may be influenced by the presence of the described molecule. The relationships between the molecule and these genes are based on structural similarities and the known functions of the encoded proteins.
