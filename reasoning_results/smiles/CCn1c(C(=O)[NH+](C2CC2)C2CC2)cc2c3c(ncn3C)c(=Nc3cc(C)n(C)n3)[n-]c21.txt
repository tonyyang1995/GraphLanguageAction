Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCn1c(C(=O)[NH+](C2CC2)C2CC2)cc2c3c(ncn3C)c(=Nc3cc(C)n(C)n3)[n-]c21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that includes a benzene ring system, amide, and other functional groups such as esters, amines, and nitro groups. The presence of these functional groups suggests the molecule could interact with proteins that have binding sites for similar chemical moieties.
Step 2: Notably, the molecule contains an amide group (-CONH-) which is a common functional group in drugs that act as agonists or antagonists at G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This feature is relevant to several of the listed genes, as many of them encode for GPCRs, including DRD2 (Dopamine Receptor D2), DRD3 (Dopamine Receptor D3), DRD4 (Dopamine Receptor D4), HTR1A (Serotonin Receptor 1A), HTR2A (Serotonin Receptor 2A), HTR2B (Serotonin Receptor 2B), and HTR2C (Serotonin Receptor 2C).
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule has a nitro group (-NO2), which can act as a modulator of protein function through redox reactions or direct binding interactions. Nitro groups are known to be involved in the regulation of enzymes like cytochrome P450 (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and may also influence the activity of kinases (e.g., LCK, MCL1) due to their ability to form covalent bonds.
Step 4: The presence of a benzene ring and amide group suggests the molecule might have affinity for proteins involved in cell signaling pathways, such as those encoded by genes like PTGS1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase 1) and SIGMAR1 (Sigma Receptor 1), both of which play roles in inflammatory responses and pain modulation.
Step 5: Considering the above structural features and their potential interactions with proteins encoded by the listed genes, the most likely related genes include: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, PTGS1, and SIGMAR1.
Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2
- DRD3
- DRD4
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- PTGS1
- SIGMAR1
These genes are most likely to be influenced by the molecule due to their involvement in neurotransmitter and hormone receptor signaling, as well as metabolic pathways. Other genes may also be indirectly affected depending on the exact mechanism of action of the molecule. However, the primary focus based on the given structure would be on the aforementioned genes.
