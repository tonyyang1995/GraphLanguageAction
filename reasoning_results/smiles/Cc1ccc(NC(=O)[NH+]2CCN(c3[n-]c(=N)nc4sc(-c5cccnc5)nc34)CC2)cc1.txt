Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(NC(=O)[NH+]2CCN(c3[n-]c(=N)nc4sc(-c5cccnc5)nc34)CC2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring fused to a benzene ring, which is characteristic of many ligands that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature is known to bind to and activate certain GPCRs.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH2) in the molecule suggests it could be an agonist or antagonist for receptors that have this functional group as a binding site, such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2).
Step 3: The nitrogen atom in the carboxamide group can form a hydrogen bond, which may facilitate binding to receptors like muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), which often have hydrogen-bonding interactions.
Step 4: The overall structure and functional groups of the molecule are consistent with its potential to act as a modulator of various neurotransmitter systems, particularly those involving dopamine (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) and serotonin (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), given the presence of multiple aromatic rings and heteroatoms.
Step 5: The molecule's structure also aligns with potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which could affect its pharmacokinetics.
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
