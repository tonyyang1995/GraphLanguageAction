Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(Cl)c(N=c2[n-]cnc3cc(OCC4CC[NH+](C)CC4)c(OC)cc23)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure including a benzene ring, a chlorine atom, a nitrogen atom with a negative charge, and an amide group. The presence of a nitrogen atom with a negative charge (N=c2[n-]) suggests that this molecule may have some pharmacological activity involving protonation/deprotonation processes.
Step 2: Considering the pattern of the molecule, it includes several functional groups such as amides, phenols, and a quaternary ammonium salt. These functional groups are often involved in interactions with various proteins, particularly receptors and transporters.
Step 3: The molecule's structure is similar to known ligands for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are known to interact with multiple neurotransmitters and hormones. This structural similarity suggests potential interactions with GPCRs encoded by genes such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode serotonin receptors.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of aromatic rings and functional groups like amides and phenols might indicate the molecule could interact with enzymes such as those encoded by CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs.
Step 5: Given the molecular structure and its potential interactions with neurotransmitter receptors and drug-metabolizing enzymes, the related genes would include HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
Summary of related gene names: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6.
