Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+]1CC[NH+](C(=O)c2ccc(COc3ccc(C(C)(C)C)cc3)o2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups, including an amide group (-CO-NH-) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which are characteristic of many drugs that interact with receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and a pyrrolidine ring suggests potential interactions with aromatic amino acids in protein binding sites, such as those found in G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other membrane proteins.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a quinoline ring, which is known to interact with certain enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYPs). This indicates possible metabolic pathways involving CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4.
Step 4: Given the presence of amine groups and the overall structure, the molecule could be a ligand for various neurotransmitter receptors, such as dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) and serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and functional groups, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmission, including CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
