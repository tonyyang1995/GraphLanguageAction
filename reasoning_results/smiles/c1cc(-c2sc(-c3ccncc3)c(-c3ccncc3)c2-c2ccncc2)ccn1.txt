Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: c1cc(-c2sc(-c3ccncc3)c(-c3ccncc3)c2-c2ccncc2)ccn1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings and substituents, including a benzene ring, a thiophene ring, and various nitrogen-containing heterocycles. This type of molecular structure is often found in drugs that interact with receptors or enzymes, particularly those involved in neurotransmission and metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of multiple nitrogen-containing heterocycles suggests the molecule could potentially act as an agonist or antagonist for receptors that bind such ligands. For example, the thiophene and pyrrole rings are common in molecules that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are involved in signaling pathways and are encoded by several of the listed genes like HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule's structure includes amine groups (-NH2) and possibly other functional groups that could serve as substrates for enzymes such as cytochrome P450s (CYPs). These enzymes are encoded by CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, among others. Therefore, this molecule might be metabolized by these enzymes, affecting their activity or stability.
Step 4: Given the complexity and the potential for interaction with both receptors and enzymes, it is likely that the molecule could have effects on multiple pathways involving neurotransmission and drug metabolism. This suggests that the molecule might be related to a few key genes rather than just one, specifically those involved in neurotransmitter systems and drug metabolism.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the genes most closely related to the described molecule are:
- GPCRs: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- Drug Metabolism Enzymes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6
These genes encode proteins that interact directly with the molecule's structure or play critical roles in its metabolism and function within the body.
