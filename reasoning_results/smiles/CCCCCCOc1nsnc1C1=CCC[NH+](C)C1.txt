Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCCCOc1nsnc1C1=CCC[NH+](C)C1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a linear carbon backbone with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups and an amide group (-CONH2). It also contains a quaternary ammonium salt group ([NH+]) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This complex structure suggests it may interact with proteins that have binding sites for similar functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of a quaternary ammonium salt group and an amide group could indicate that the molecule might be an agonist or inhibitor of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are known to bind small molecules with these functional groups. GPCRs are involved in various signaling pathways and are associated with several of the listed genes, such as CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 3: The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in the molecule might suggest it could interact with ion channels, particularly those with acidic residues in their binding sites, like KCNH2, which encodes the HERG potassium channel.
Step 4: Given the presence of multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups, the molecule could potentially act as a substrate for enzymes involved in metabolism, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are all involved in drug metabolism.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and functional groups, the molecule could influence neurotransmitter release or receptor activity, making it relevant to genes involved in neurobiology and neurotransmission, such as HRH1, PTGS1, and SIGMAR1.
Summary of related gene names: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, HRH1, PTGS1, SIGMAR1.
