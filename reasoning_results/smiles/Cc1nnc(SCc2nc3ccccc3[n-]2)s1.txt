Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1nnc(SCc2nc3ccccc3[n-]2)s1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with multiple substituents, including a nitro group, a sulfonyl group, and a substituted amine. These structural features suggest potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a sulfonyl group indicates the molecule may be a substrate for CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are involved in the metabolism of various drugs.
Step 3: The substituted amine and nitro group could potentially interact with receptors such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are involved in neurotransmission.
Step 4: The overall structure hints at possible binding to enzymes like CYP3A4, which plays a role in the metabolism of many drugs.
Step 5: Given the molecule's potential to interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmission, the related genes include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with multiple substituents, including a nitro group, a sulfonyl group, and a substituted amine.
Step 2: The presence of a sulfonyl group suggests potential interaction with CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which metabolize various drugs.
Step 3: The substituted amine and nitro group indicate possible binding to serotonin receptors, such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C.
Step 4: The overall structure implies potential binding to CYP3A4, an important enzyme in drug metabolism.
Step 5: Related genes include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C.
