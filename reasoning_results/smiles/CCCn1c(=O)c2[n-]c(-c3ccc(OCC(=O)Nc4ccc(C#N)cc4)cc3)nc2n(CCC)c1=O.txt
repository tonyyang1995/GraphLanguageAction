Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCn1c(=O)c2[n-]c(-c3ccc(OCC(=O)Nc4ccc(C#N)cc4)cc3)nc2n(CCC)c1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is common in many drug molecules and can interact with various receptors and enzymes. The presence of a benzene ring suggests potential interactions with genes involved in drug metabolism and receptor binding.
Step 2: The molecule includes an amide group (-CO-NH-) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which are functional groups often found in ligands that bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This indicates a possible interaction with genes encoding GPCRs.
Step 3: The molecule also has a pyrrolidine ring, which can form hydrogen bonds and contribute to the binding affinity with certain proteins. This structural feature might be relevant to genes involved in neurotransmitter signaling pathways.
Step 4: Considering the presence of a quinoline-like structure, the molecule could potentially interact with enzymes involved in phase I metabolism, such as cytochrome P450s (CYPs). Genes like CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 are known to be involved in metabolizing drugs with similar structures.
Step 5: The molecule's overall structure, including its aromatic and heterocyclic components, suggests it may have affinity for receptors or enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways. Genes like DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HRH1, which encode for receptors that mediate responses to neurotransmitters and hormones, are likely to be relevant.
