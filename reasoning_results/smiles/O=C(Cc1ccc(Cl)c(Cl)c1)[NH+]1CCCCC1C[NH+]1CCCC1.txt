Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Cc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1)[NH+]1CCCCC1C[NH+]1CCCC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure including a benzene ring system, an amide group, and several aromatic rings with substituents such as chlorine atoms. This indicates that the molecule likely interacts with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways and may have pharmacological activity.
Step 2: The presence of multiple nitrogen atoms and amide groups suggests that this molecule could be an agonist or antagonist for receptors or ion channels. Specifically, it might interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) which are known to be regulated by various genes from the list provided.
Step 3: Given the structure, the molecule could potentially bind to receptors like DRD2 (Dopamine D2 receptor), HTR1A (Serotonin 1A receptor), HTR2A (Serotonin 2A receptor), or HTR2B (Serotonin 2B receptor). These receptors are involved in neurotransmission and are regulated by genes DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, and HTR2B.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure might also allow it to interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism such as CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4. These enzymes are responsible for metabolizing many drugs, including those that affect neurotransmission.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and potential interactions, the related genes include: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and possibly others depending on further functional analysis. 
Summary of related genes: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
