Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc(N=c2c(C#N)c[n-]c3cc(OCCC[NH+]4CC[NH+](C)CC4)c(OC)cc23)c(Cl)cc1Cl, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex molecule with multiple functional groups including an amide, a nitrile, and several aromatic rings. This complexity suggests that the molecule could potentially interact with various biological targets.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of a nitrile group (-C#N) and the overall structure of the molecule suggest it might have activity against enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. These cytochrome P450 enzymes are known to metabolize a wide range of drugs, and their activity can be influenced by structural features like the nitrile group present in this molecule.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule contains a quinolone-like structure (OCCC[NH+]CC[NH+]C), which is often associated with ligands for nuclear receptors such as PPARγ (encoded by PPARG). This suggests potential interactions with genes involved in lipid metabolism and inflammation.
Step 4: Given the presence of a cholinergic receptor-like structure (e.g., [NH+]CC[NH+]C), the molecule might also interact with cholinergic receptors, particularly those encoded by CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4, which are involved in neurotransmission.
Step 5: Lastly, the molecule’s overall structure and functional groups may influence its interaction with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are encoded by genes like DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C. These receptors are involved in various physiological processes including mood regulation, pain perception, and sensory processing.
