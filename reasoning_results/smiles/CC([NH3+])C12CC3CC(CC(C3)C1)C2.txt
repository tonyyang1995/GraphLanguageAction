Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC([NH3+])C12CC3CC(CC(C3)C1)C2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that contains a nitrogen atom bonded to a carbon atom (N-H bond), suggesting it may be involved in interactions with proteins containing amino acid residues. This is particularly relevant for genes encoding receptors or enzymes that interact with nitrogen-containing compounds.
Step 2: The presence of multiple aromatic rings and potential hydrogen bonding groups indicates that this molecule could interact with membrane-bound receptors, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Genes associated with GPCRs include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
Step 3: The molecule also has a structure that could potentially inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are encoded by CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These enzymes are important in drug metabolism, so any interaction could affect how these genes function.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a benzene ring and possible hydrophobic regions suggests the molecule might interact with ion channels, such as KCNH2, which encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and potential interactions, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, KCNH2.
