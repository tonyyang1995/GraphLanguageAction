Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NS(=O)(=O)Cc1noc2ccccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string NS(=O)(=O)Cc1noc2ccccc12 is a nitrosourea derivative, which contains a nitrile (N#C) and an oxo group (O=). This structural pattern is known to interact with various enzymes and receptors involved in drug metabolism and signaling pathways.
Step 2: The nitrosourea moiety is recognized by several enzymes, including those involved in Phase I reactions such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Specifically, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 are known to metabolize nitrosoureas, indicating that the molecule may have pharmacokinetic interactions with these enzymes.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule's structure could potentially bind to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), given its ability to form hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. GPCRs like DRD2 (Dopamine D2 receptor) and HTR1A (Serotonin 1A receptor) are known targets for small molecules due to their significant role in neurotransmission and are often modulated by drugs.
Step 4: The molecule might also interact with ion channels, such as KCNH2 (potassium channel subfamily H member 2), given the presence of functional groups that can influence channel function through binding or allosteric modulation.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related genes include CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, DRD2, and HTR1A. These genes encode enzymes and receptors that are likely to be influenced by the nitrosourea derivative's pharmacological properties.
Summary of related genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR1A.
