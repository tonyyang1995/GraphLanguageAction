Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC[NH+](CC)CCOCCOC(=O)C1(c2ccccc2)CCCC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule provided has a complex structure containing multiple functional groups such as amine (NH+), aromatic rings (benzene rings), and an ester group (O=C-O). These structural features suggest the molecule could be involved in interactions with proteins that have binding sites for similar chemical functionalities.
Step 2: The presence of an amine group (NH+) and aromatic rings indicates potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which often bind small molecules with these types of functional groups. Examples of such receptors include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, all of which are listed in the provided gene list.
Step 3: The ester group in the molecule might also interact with enzymes that metabolize drugs or other small molecules, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are included in the list of genes.
Step 4: Given the complexity of the molecule and its potential interactions with various biological targets, it is plausible that the molecule could also interact with other listed genes such as ABCB1, which encodes a multidrug resistance protein, and SLC6A4, which codes for a neurotransmitter transporter.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ABCB1, SLC6A4. 
Note: The exact nature of interaction would depend on further biochemical studies. This analysis is based on the structural features of the molecule and their potential to interact with known binding sites or metabolic pathways associated with the listed genes.
