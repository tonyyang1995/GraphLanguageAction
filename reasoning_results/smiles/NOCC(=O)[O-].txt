Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NOCC(=O)[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has the SMILES string "NOCC(=O)[O-]", which represents an oxime compound with a negatively charged oxygen atom. This structure suggests that the molecule could interact with proteins involved in signaling pathways or enzyme activities.
Step 2: Analyzing the genes provided, we look for those associated with neurotransmitter receptors, enzymes, and signaling pathways. Genes like DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), HTR1A (Serotonin receptor 1A), HTR2A (Serotonin receptor 2A), and CYP2D6 (Cytochrome P450 2D6) are directly involved in neurotransmitter signaling and metabolism.
Step 3: The oxime group (-N=O) in the molecule can potentially form hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues in receptor binding sites, particularly those containing polar or charged side chains. This interaction could modulate the activity of receptors such as DRD2 and HTR2A, which have known ligand-binding sites that include polar amino acids.
Step 4: Additionally, the negatively charged oxygen atom might influence the binding affinity of the molecule to certain ion channels or enzymes. For example, it could affect the binding of the molecule to CYP2D6, which is known to metabolize various drugs through oxidation reactions involving hydroxyl groups.
Step 5: Based on the structure and properties of the molecule, the related genes include DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, and CYP2D6, as they are directly involved in neurotransmitter signaling and drug metabolism, which could be affected by the oxime group and negatively charged oxygen atom present in the molecule.
