Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)c1cc(-c2ccc(OC)cc2F)nc2c1c(C)nn2CCC#N, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains several functional groups such as an amide (C=O), a benzene ring, and a pyrrolidine ring, which are characteristic features for drugs that interact with receptors and enzymes. The presence of a benzene ring and a heterocyclic group like pyrrolidine suggests potential interactions with various proteins, particularly those involved in signal transduction and receptor binding.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a fluorine atom (-F) attached to a benzene ring, which is common in drugs designed to modulate G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to its ability to influence ligand-receptor binding affinity and selectivity.
Step 3: The presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocycle and an amide group indicates that this molecule could be a potential agonist or antagonist for GPCRs, which are known to interact with various neurotransmitters and hormones. This feature aligns with the involvement of genes encoding GPCRs in neurotransmission and hormone signaling pathways.
Step 4: Given the pattern of substituents and functional groups, this molecule may have an impact on receptors such as adrenergic (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), muscarinic (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), dopaminergic (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), and serotoninergic (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) receptors, all of which play crucial roles in the central nervous system and are targets for numerous psychiatric and neurological disorders.
Step 5: Considering the molecular structure and its potential interactions with GPCRs, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6. These genes encode receptors that are directly influenced by molecules with the described structural features. 
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
