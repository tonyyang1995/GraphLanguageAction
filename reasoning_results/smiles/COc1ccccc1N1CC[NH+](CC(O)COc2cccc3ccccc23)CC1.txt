Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccccc1N1CC[NH+](CC(O)COc2cccc3ccccc23)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex molecule containing a benzene ring with multiple substituents including a nitrogen atom, an amine group, and various alkyl chains. This structure suggests that the molecule could interact with proteins involved in neurotransmission or drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom and an amine group indicates that this molecule likely contains a heterocyclic ring and an amine functional group, which are common in ligands for receptors and transporters involved in neurotransmission pathways.
Step 3: Given the complexity of the molecule and its potential to interact with multiple biological targets, it is more plausible that the molecule would have a broader impact across several genes rather than being specifically related to just one or two genes. However, considering the features of the molecule, it may have a particular affinity for enzymes involved in metabolism, such as CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, due to the presence of multiple functional groups that could serve as substrates for these enzymes.
Step 4: The molecule also has potential interactions with receptors and transporters, particularly those involved in the regulation of neurotransmitters and hormones. For instance, it might interact with HTR2A (serotonin receptor), HTR2B, HTR2C, and DRD2 (dopamine receptors), given their binding sites for ligands with similar chemical structures.
Step 5: Based on the analysis of the molecule's structure and its potential interactions, the related genes are: CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and DRD2.
Summary of Related Gene Names:
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- DRD2
These genes are involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmission, respectively, suggesting the molecule's potential impact on these biological processes.
