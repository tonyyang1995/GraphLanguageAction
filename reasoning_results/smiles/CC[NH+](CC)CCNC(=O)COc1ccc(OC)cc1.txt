Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC[NH+](CC)CCNC(=O)COc1ccc(OC)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring, a pyrrolidine ring, and several other functional groups including an amide group (N-C=O), an ester group (C-O), and hydroxyl (-OH) and methyl (-CH3) substituents. This structure suggests it could be a drug-like molecule, interacting with receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: Given the presence of a benzene ring and an amide group, this molecule likely interacts with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP enzymes. CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 are known to metabolize various drugs and are involved in the biotransformation of xenobiotics.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a choline acetyltransferase inhibitor motif (choline moiety and an acetyl group), which may suggest potential interactions with acetylcholine receptors. ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4 encode for adrenergic and cholinergic receptors, which could be influenced by the molecule.
Step 4: Considering the presence of an ester group and a carboxylic acid, the molecule might interact with ion channels or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). KCNH2 encodes for a potassium voltage-gated channel, and HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 encode for serotonin receptors, which are known to bind to ligands with similar functional groups.
Step 5: The overall structure of the molecule, with its multiple functional groups and potential for interaction with both enzymes and receptors, suggests that it could have a broad pharmacological profile. The related genes include those involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and those encoding for receptors and ion channels (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, KCNH2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
