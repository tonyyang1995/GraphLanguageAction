Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCn1c(-c2no[n-]c2=NC(=O)c2ccccc2)nc2ccccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a tricyclic structure with a nitrogen atom, which suggests it may be an analog of a known compound such as a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). This structural feature aligns with the known pharmacophores of certain drugs that interact with receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmission and inflammation.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring, particularly in a position that could form a basic site, is characteristic of molecules that can act as partial agonists or antagonists for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are often targets for drugs affecting neurotransmission. This is relevant to genes like DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), HTR1A (serotonin receptor 1A), and HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A).
Step 3: The molecule also includes a nitro group (-NO2) and a cyano group (-CN), which are functional groups known to influence enzyme activity, particularly those involved in metabolic pathways. These functional groups are associated with the metabolism of drugs and can affect the expression or activity of genes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule has a benzene ring with substituents that could potentially interact with DNA or proteins involved in cell signaling and proliferation. This is relevant to genes such as PTGS1 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1) and MCL1 (myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1), which are involved in inflammation and cell survival, respectively.
Step 5: Considering the above structural features and their potential interactions with biological targets, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, PTGS1, and MCL1. These genes are involved in neurotransmission, drug metabolism, inflammation, and cell survival. 
Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- PTGS1
- MCL1
These genes are the most relevant based on the structural analysis of the molecule. Other genes listed might have indirect relationships but were not directly supported by the molecule's structure in this context.
