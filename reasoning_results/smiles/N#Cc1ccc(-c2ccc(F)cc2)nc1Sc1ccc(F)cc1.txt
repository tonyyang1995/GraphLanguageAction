Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N#Cc1ccc(-c2ccc(F)cc2)nc1Sc1ccc(F)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom triple-bonded to a carbon atom (N#C), which is characteristic of pyrrole-like structures. This feature suggests potential interactions with enzymes that metabolize drugs containing similar functional groups, such as those involved in Phase I metabolism like CYP enzymes.
Step 2: Additionally, the molecule includes fluorine atoms (-F) attached to carbon rings, which could indicate the presence of halogenated aromatic compounds. Such compounds are often substrates for CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, which play roles in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The overall structure, including the heterocyclic ring systems and aromatic substituents, resembles those found in ligands that bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Notably, GPCRs are involved in signal transduction pathways and are targets for many pharmaceuticals. Genes encoding these receptors include DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, and HRH1.
Step 4: Furthermore, the presence of a sulfonamide group (-S) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) might suggest interaction with enzymes like CYP3A4, which is known to oxidize these functional groups during metabolism.
Step 5: Based on the structural features identified, the molecule may be related to several genes involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and neurotransmission/receptor signaling (DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HRH1).
