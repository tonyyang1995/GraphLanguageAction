Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(=O)c1ccc(S(=O)(=O)[N-]C(=O)[NH2+]C2CCCCC2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples or additional text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with an acetyl group and a sulfonyl group attached, indicating potential activity against enzymes that metabolize drugs, such as CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). This suggests a possible interaction with genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes.
Step 2: The molecule also has a thioether sulfur atom connected to a nitrogen atom bearing a positive charge, which could interact with ion channels or receptors containing similar functional groups. This pattern is relevant to genes encoding ion channels and receptors like KCNH2 (hERG potassium channel), HTR2A (serotonin receptor), and HRH1 (histamine receptor).
Step 3: The presence of multiple aromatic rings and functional groups, including a carboxylic acid group, indicates potential for binding to proteins involved in signal transduction pathways. Genes such as PTGS1 (COX-1/COX-2) and SLC6A4 (norepinephrine transporter) might be relevant due to their roles in signaling and neurotransmission.
Step 4: The molecule's structure includes a pyrrolidine ring, which is known to interact with certain G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Genes encoding GPCRs such as DRD2 (D2 dopamine receptor), DRD3 (D3 dopamine receptor), and DRD4 (D4 dopamine receptor) may have interactions with this molecule.
Step 5: The overall structure and functional groups suggest the molecule could interact with enzymes and receptors involved in various biological processes, including drug metabolism, ion channel function, and neurotransmission. Relevant genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, KCNH2, HTR2A, HRH1, PTGS1, SLC6A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4. Step 5: Summary of related gene names: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, KCNH2, HTR2A, HRH1, PTGS1, SLC6A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
