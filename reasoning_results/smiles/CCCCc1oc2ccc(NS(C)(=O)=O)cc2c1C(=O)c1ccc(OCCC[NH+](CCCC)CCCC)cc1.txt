Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCc1oc2ccc(NS(C)(=O)=O)cc2c1C(=O)c1ccc(OCCC[NH+](CCCC)CCCC)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a tricyclic structure with a central nitrogen atom, which suggests potential interactions with receptors that have similar chemical features. This pattern is particularly relevant to adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), which are known to bind to and activate ligands with aromatic rings and nitrogen atoms.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a pyrrolidine ring and an amide group (-CONH-), which could indicate a role in modulating enzymes involved in drug metabolism. This feature is notably associated with genes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which encode cytochrome P450 enzymes that metabolize various drugs.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a benzene ring and an ester group (-COOR) might suggest the molecule has potential effects on G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Genes like HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which code for serotonin receptors, could be influenced by this structural motif.
Step 4: The molecule’s overall structure, with multiple functional groups including a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an amide, may interact with ion channels. This could be relevant to KCNH2, which encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2.
