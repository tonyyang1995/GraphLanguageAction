Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=S(=O)(c1ccc2nc(-c3ccco3)c(-c3ccco3)nc2c1)[NH+]1CCOCC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), which is characteristic of drugs that may interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism such as CYP enzymes. This suggests potential interactions with CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) indicates possible interactions with receptors like G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Specifically, this could relate to DRD2, HTR2A, and HTR2B, which are dopamine and serotonin receptors, respectively.
Step 3: The aromatic amine group and the overall structure suggest potential binding to ion channels or transporters. For instance, CACNA1H, which encodes a calcium channel, and SLC6A4, which is a serotonin transporter, might be relevant.
Step 4: The presence of an ester group and a nitrophenyl group could indicate interaction with enzymes involved in phase II metabolism, such as PTGS1, which codes for prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1.
Step 5: The molecule's overall structure and functional groups hint at possible interactions with kinases, such as LCK, which is a tyrosine kinase.
