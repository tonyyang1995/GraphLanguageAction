Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)(C)c1cc(=NC(=O)Nc2ccc(-c3cn4c(n3)sc3cc(OCC[NH+]5CCOCC5)ccc34)cc2)[n-]o1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups including an amide group (-CONH2), a nitrile group (-CN), and a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH). The presence of these functional groups suggests that the molecule could potentially interact with proteins involved in signaling pathways, enzymatic activities, or receptor binding.
Step 2: The nitrile group (-CN) is typically associated with drugs that inhibit certain enzymes or receptors. Notably, the presence of this group may indicate a potential interaction with enzymes such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are involved in the metabolism of various drugs. These enzymes belong to the cytochrome P450 family, and their activity can be influenced by compounds containing nitriles.
Step 3: The amide group (-CONH2) is another key feature of the molecule. This functional group is commonly found in peptide and protein structures, suggesting that the molecule might interact with receptors or enzymes that have amide-binding sites. Specifically, it could interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like DRD2, DRD3, and HTR2A, which have amide-binding pockets.
Step 4: The phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) indicates that the molecule could act as a ligand for receptors or enzymes that recognize aromatic rings and hydroxyl groups. For example, this group might interact with receptors such as CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4, which are cholinergic receptors known to bind to molecules containing aromatic rings and hydroxyl groups.
Step 5: Based on the identified functional groups and their potential interactions, the related genes include those involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19), neurotransmitter signaling (DRD2, DRD3, HTR2A), and cholinergic signaling (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- DRD2
- DRD3
- HTR2A
- CHRM1
- CHRM3
- CHRM4 Step 5: Summary of related gene names:
- CHRM4
These genes are primarily involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmitter signaling pathways, indicating that the molecule could have significant effects on these processes. The specific interactions would depend on the exact binding affinities and mechanisms of action of the molecule with these proteins.
