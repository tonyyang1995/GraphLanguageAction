Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: c1ccc2[n-]c(-c3cscn3)nc2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples or additional text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a tricyclic structure with a nitrogen atom in the ring, suggesting potential interactions with receptors that have similar structural features. This pattern is commonly found in molecules that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 2: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) attached to the nitrogen atom in the ring could indicate an interaction with enzymes involved in metabolism or signaling pathways. This functional group is known to modulate the activity of several genes involved in these processes.
Step 3: The overall structure of the molecule suggests it may interact with GPCRs such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), and dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4). These receptors are known to have binding sites for molecules with similar structural characteristics.
Step 4: The molecule's potential to influence signaling pathways through its interaction with these receptors may also affect genes involved in neurotransmission and hormone regulation, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and HRH1.
Step 5: The molecule's structural features and potential interactions with the aforementioned receptors and signaling pathways suggest it may be related to the genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and HRH1. Step 5: List of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1.
