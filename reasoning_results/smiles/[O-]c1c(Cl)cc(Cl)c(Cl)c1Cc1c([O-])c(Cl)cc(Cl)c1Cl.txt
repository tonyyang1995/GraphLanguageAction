Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [O-]c1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cc1c([O-])c(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound with multiple rings and substituents, including chlorine atoms and oxygen atoms. This complexity suggests that it may interact with various biological targets. One notable feature is the presence of aromatic rings, which are common in many bioactive molecules due to their ability to form stable interactions with proteins.
Step 2: The molecule contains several negatively charged functional groups (-O- and -Cl), indicating it could act as an ion channel blocker or modulator. Specifically, the presence of chloride ions (-Cl) might suggest interaction with chloride channels or transporters, while the -O- group could indicate potential interactions with receptors or enzymes that bind to hydroxyl groups.
Step 3: Given the structure's potential to interact with ion channels or transporters, it is reasonable to consider genes involved in these processes. Genes such as KCNH2 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2) and HRH1 (histamine H1 receptor) are directly related to ion channel function. Additionally, genes like SLC6A2 (solute carrier family 6 member 2) and SLC6A4 (solute carrier family 6 member 4) are involved in neurotransmitter reuptake and could be affected by this molecule if it acts as a modulator of these transporters.
Step 4: Furthermore, the molecule's structure hints at possible interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are known to have binding sites for a wide range of ligands, and the presence of hydrophobic and polar regions in the molecule could facilitate such interactions. Relevant genes include HTR1A (serotonin receptor 1A), HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A), HTR2B (serotonin receptor 2B), and HTR2C (serotonin receptor 2C), all of which are involved in serotonin signaling pathways.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and potential interactions, the related genes can be summarized as follows: KCNH2, HRH1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C.
Summary of related gene names:
- KCNH2
- HRH1
- SLC6A2
- SLC6A4
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
These genes are primarily involved in ion channel function and GPCR-mediated signaling pathways, which aligns with the structural features of the given molecule. Other genes listed do not appear to have a direct relationship based on the molecule's structure. However, further experimental validation would be necessary to confirm any specific interactions.
