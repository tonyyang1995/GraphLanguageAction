Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cccc(=NC2(C(F)(F)F)[NH+]=C(c3ccccc3)NC2=O)[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with multiple functional groups including amide, nitrile, and fluorine substituents. This indicates that the molecule likely interacts with proteins involved in signal transduction, transport, or metabolism.
Step 2: Considering the presence of an amide group (-CO-NH-) and a nitrile group (-CN), this molecule could potentially interact with enzymes or receptors involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways, which are often associated with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other signaling molecules.
Step 3: Given the presence of fluorine atoms, this molecule might be a ligand for certain receptors or enzymes that recognize or bind to fluorinated compounds, such as some GPCRs or transporters. Fluorination can also affect the pharmacokinetic properties of the molecule, influencing its binding affinity and stability.
Step 4: Analyzing the gene list provided, several genes encode for GPCRs and other receptors that could potentially interact with this molecule, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes are involved in the regulation of various physiological processes, such as neurotransmission, stress response, and pain perception.
Step 5: Additionally, the presence of a nitrile group suggests potential interactions with enzymes like CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs and xenobiotics. Therefore, the molecule may also have indirect effects on these genes through modulation of their activity.
