Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+]1CC[NH+]2c3ccccc3Cc3ccccc3C2C1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge, which is part of a heterocyclic ring system. This structural feature suggests potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for positively charged groups or aromatic rings.
Step 2: The molecule also includes multiple benzene rings, which are known to interact with various enzymes and receptors involved in drug metabolism and signaling pathways.
Step 3: The presence of cyclic structures and aromatic rings may indicate potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly those involved in neurotransmission and hormone signaling, such as adrenergic and muscarinic receptors.
Step 4: Given the complexity and specific features of the molecule, it could potentially interact with several enzymes involved in the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Step 5: Considering the interactions with enzymes and receptors mentioned, the related genes include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CNR1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and SLC6A4. Step 5: Related Gene Names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CNR1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, SLC6A4.
