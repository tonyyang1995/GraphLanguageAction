Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+](C)Cc1ccccc1Oc1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule, represented by the SMILES string C[NH+](C)Cc1ccccc1Oc1ccccc1, consists of a pyrrolidine ring system, a phenolic hydroxyl group, and an amide group. The presence of a positively charged nitrogen (N+) and a phenolic oxygen (O) suggest potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for basic residues and hydroxyl groups.
Step 2: The phenolic hydroxyl group (O) could interact with proteins containing acidic residues such as glutamic acid or aspartic acid, which are commonly found in transmembrane domains and extracellular regions of receptors. This interaction might be particularly relevant to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which often have hydrophilic regions for ligand binding.
Step 3: The positively charged nitrogen (N+) in the molecule could interact with negatively charged residues in the active site of enzymes, such as those involved in metabolism. For example, enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are part of the cytochrome P450 family, contain negatively charged residues that can form salt bridges with positively charged ligands.
Step 4: The presence of a pyrrolidine ring, which is a six-membered heterocycle with a nitrogen atom, could also be relevant to the binding sites of certain receptors, particularly those with a preference for small, flexible molecules. This structural feature might be relevant to receptors such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are serotonin receptors known to bind various types of ligands, including small molecules.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the molecule could be related to the following genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP3A4
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C Step 1: The molecule has a pyrrolidine ring, a phenolic hydroxyl group, and an amide group.
Step 2: The phenolic hydroxyl group suggests potential interactions with acidic residues, possibly relevant to GPCRs.
Step 3: The positively charged nitrogen indicates potential interactions with negatively charged residues in enzyme active sites.
Step 4: The pyrrolidine ring could interact with flexible binding sites in receptors.
Step 5: The molecule is likely related to CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C.
- HTR2C
Note: The summary focuses on the most relevant genes based on the molecule's structure and potential interactions. Other genes may be related but are not explicitly discussed here due to the complexity of their roles and the focus on simpler interactions.
