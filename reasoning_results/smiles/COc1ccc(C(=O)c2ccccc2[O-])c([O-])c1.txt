Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(C(=O)c2ccccc2[O-])c([O-])c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string COc1ccc(C(=O)c2ccccc2[O-])c([O-])c1 contains a benzene ring system, a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and two negatively charged oxygen atoms ([-O-]). The presence of a carboxylic acid group suggests that this molecule could be an inhibitor or activator of enzymes involved in metabolism, such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes.
Step 2: Among the listed genes, several are involved in the regulation of enzymes that metabolize drugs and other xenobiotics. Specifically, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 are known to be involved in the metabolism of various compounds through the hydroxylation process, which often involves carboxylic acid groups. Therefore, the molecule's structure might interact with these enzymes.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a carboxylic acid group in the molecule may also suggest potential interactions with receptors that have acidic binding sites. For example, HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A) and HTR2B (serotonin receptor 2B) are G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that can bind to various ligands, including those with carboxylic acid groups. The molecule might thus influence the activity of these receptors.
Step 4: The negatively charged oxygen atoms in the molecule could also interact with positively charged residues in proteins, potentially affecting the function of ion channels like KCNH2 (hERG potassium channel) or other proteins with similar characteristics.
Step 5: Based on the structure and properties of the molecule, the related genes are: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, HTR2A, HTR2B, KCNH2.
Summary of related gene names: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, HTR2A, HTR2B, KCNH2.
