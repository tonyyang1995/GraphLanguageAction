Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(CN=c2[n-]c(N(CCO)CCO)nc3c2ncn3C(C)C)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a cyano group (-CN) and a nitro group (-NO2). These functional groups are often involved in binding to proteins, particularly enzymes and receptors, which could potentially interact with various genes.
Step 2: The presence of a quinoline-like structure (quinoline is a heterocyclic aromatic organic compound with a nitrogen atom in the ring) suggests possible interactions with genes involved in metabolic pathways, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which encode enzymes that metabolize drugs and other xenobiotics.
Step 3: The molecule also has a pyrrole ring with a hydroxyl group (-OH), which might interact with genes encoding for receptors or ion channels, such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and KCNH2.
Step 4: The presence of a phenylacetylene moiety could indicate potential interactions with genes involved in signal transduction pathways, such as PTGS1, which encodes COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes.
Step 5: Given the complexity and diverse functional groups present, the molecule may have multiple points of interaction with different genes, including but not limited to those involved in metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6), neurotransmission (HTR2A, HTR2B, KCNH2), and inflammation (PTGS1).
