Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains an amine group (-NH+) and a benzene ring, which are common in ligands that interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This suggests potential interaction with genes encoding GPCRs.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and an amide group also indicates a possibility of interaction with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP family genes.
Step 3: The molecule's structure includes a quinoline-like moiety, which is known to interact with certain receptors and transport proteins, potentially linking it to genes like SLC6A2 and SLC6A4.
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule could also suggest interactions with genes involved in receptor signaling pathways, such as HRH1 and KDR.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and functional groups present, the molecule may be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, LCK, OPARK1, PTGS1, SIGMAR1, and SLC6A4. Step 1: The molecule contains an amine group (-NH+) and a benzene ring, which are common in ligands that interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and an amide group suggests potential interaction with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP family genes.
