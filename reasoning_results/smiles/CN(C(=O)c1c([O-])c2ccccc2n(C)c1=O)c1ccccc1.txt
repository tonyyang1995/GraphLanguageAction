Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CN(C(=O)c1c([O-])c2ccccc2n(C)c1=O)c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound that includes a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring (indicated by the 'N' in the SMILES string), an amide group (-CO-NH-), and aromatic rings (indicated by the 'c' characters). The presence of a nitrogen atom and the amide group suggests the molecule could be a potential ligand for receptors or enzymes that interact with such functional groups.
Step 2: The aromatic rings and the amide group are common structural motifs found in many neurotransmitter receptors, particularly G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels. This structural similarity implies that the molecule might have affinity for certain types of receptors or enzymes that share these structural features.
Step 3: Among the provided genes, several are known to encode for receptors or enzymes that interact with ligands containing amide groups and aromatic rings. For instance, genes encoding GPCRs like DRD2 (Dopamine D2 receptor), HTR1A (Serotonin 1A receptor), HTR2A (Serotonin 2A receptor), and HTR2B (Serotonin 2B receptor) are likely candidates due to their ligand-binding domains which often contain amide and aromatic residues.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of an amide group and aromatic rings could also suggest potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and the potential interactions with the aforementioned genes, the related gene names are: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. These genes encode proteins that are directly involved in the recognition and metabolism of molecules with structural features similar to the given SMILES string.
