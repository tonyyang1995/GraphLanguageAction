Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1c(-c2ccc(C(N)=O)c3[nH]c4cc(C(C)(C)O)ccc4c23)cccc1-n1cnc2ccccc2c1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with an amide group (-CONH2), which is characteristic of several drug classes, including those that interact with receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the amide group, along with the adjacent phenyl ring, suggests potential interaction with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as adrenergic and muscarinic receptors, which are encoded by genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a cyano group (-CN) and a carbonyl group (-CO), which are typical features of compounds that can act as inhibitors of certain enzymes, such as those involved in drug metabolism, like CYP2C9 and CYP2D6.
Step 4: The presence of a thioether group (-S-) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) indicates potential for interactions with other enzymes and receptors, possibly influencing signaling pathways involving genes like PTGS1 (encoding COX-1/COX-2), which are involved in inflammation and pain response.
Step 5: Given the complexity of the molecule and its structural features, it could have multiple points of interaction with various genes, but the primary focus would be on GPCRs and enzymes involved in metabolism and signaling pathways.
