Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC[NH+](CCO)CCCC(C)N=c1cc[n-]c2cc(Cl)ccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains multiple functional groups including an amide (NH), an ester (CO), and a carboxyl group (C=O). These functional groups suggest that the molecule could be involved in binding to proteins that interact with such chemical moieties.
Step 2: The presence of a positively charged amine group (NH+) indicates the molecule has a basic character. This feature might allow it to interact with acidic residues in protein active sites or bind to ion channels that have positively charged regions.
Step 3: The molecule also includes aromatic rings (e.g., benzene rings in the nitroimidazole and pyrrole structures) which are often recognized by proteins through hydrogen bonding and pi-pi interactions.
Step 4: Given the structural complexity and the presence of both hydrophobic and polar regions, this molecule likely targets enzymes or receptors with similar structural characteristics. For instance, it may interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds and other non-covalent interactions.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule could potentially interact with several of the listed genes, particularly those encoding for GPCRs (such as DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) and enzymes like CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- HTR6
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4 Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule could potentially interact with several of the listed genes, particularly those encoding for GPCRs (such as DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR2C, HTR6) and enzymes like CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are involved in drug metabolism.
- CYP3A4
Note: There was a repetition of "HTR2C" in the original response, so it has been corrected to "HTR2C" once. The summary now lists all the relevant genes clearly.
