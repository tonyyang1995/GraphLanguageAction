Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N#CS, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule N#CS corresponds to N-Carbonylamine, which is a functional group that includes a nitrogen atom triple-bonded to a carbon atom (N#C) and a carbonyl group (-CO). This structure is not directly associated with any of the given genes.
Step 2: To identify potential relationships, we need to consider the biological activities and pathways associated with the given genes. However, the provided SMILES string does not suggest any direct interaction with the listed genes based on its structure.
Step 3: The genes listed are primarily involved in various physiological processes such as drug metabolism, neurotransmission, and cell signaling. None of these processes are directly linked to the N-Carbonylamine structure without additional context.
Step 4: Since the molecule N#CS does not have a recognized role in the mechanisms of action of the listed genes, there is no clear relationship between the molecule and these genes.
Step 5: Therefore, none of the listed genes are directly related to the molecule N#CS based on its structure and the functions of the listed genes.
