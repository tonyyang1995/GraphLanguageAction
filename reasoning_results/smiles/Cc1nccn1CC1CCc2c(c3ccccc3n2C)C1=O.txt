Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1nccn1CC1CCc2c(c3ccccc3n2C)C1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule, which appears to be a benzodiazepine derivative with a quinoline ring system and a phenolic hydroxyl group. This structure suggests potential interactions with GABA-A receptors, which are known to have binding sites for benzodiazepines.
Step 2: GABA-A receptors are involved in various neurotransmission processes and are associated with several genes that encode their subunits. The molecule's pattern aligns well with the known binding pockets of GABA-A receptor subunits, particularly those encoded by the CHRM1 (Cholinergic receptor, muscarinic, M1), CHRM3 (Cholinergic receptor, muscarinic, M3), and CHRM4 (Cholinergic receptor, muscarinic, M4) genes.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group and the overall molecular structure could also interact with other receptors like dopamine receptors. The DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), DRD3 (Dopamine receptor D3), and DRD4 (Dopamine receptor D4) genes encode receptors that might interact with this molecule due to their structural compatibility with similar ligands.
Step 4: The molecule's complex structure and potential to bind multiple types of receptors indicate its possible involvement in various neurological and physiological processes, which are regulated by the genes listed above.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis and potential receptor interactions, the related genes include: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
Summary of related genes: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
