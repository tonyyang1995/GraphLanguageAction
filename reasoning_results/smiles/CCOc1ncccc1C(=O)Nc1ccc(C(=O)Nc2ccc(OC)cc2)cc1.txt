Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOc1ncccc1C(=O)Nc1ccc(C(=O)Nc2ccc(OC)cc2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with multiple functional groups such as an amide, a phenolic hydroxyl group, and a cyano group. This structural pattern suggests potential interactions with enzymes and receptors that are involved in signal transduction and drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) indicates the molecule could interact with proteins containing cysteine residues through Michael addition, which might affect proteins like ABL1 and LCK, both of which have tyrosine kinase activity.
Step 3: The amide group (-CONH-) and the phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) suggest the molecule may be able to form hydrogen bonds, which could lead to interactions with proteins like DRD2 and HTR2A, which are G-protein coupled receptors.
Step 4: The overall structure and functional groups indicate the molecule could potentially inhibit or activate enzymes such as CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4, which are involved in the metabolism of various drugs and endogenous substances.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes include: ABL1, LCK, DRD2, HTR2A, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4. 
Summary of Related Genes: ABL1, LCK, DRD2, HTR2A, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4.
