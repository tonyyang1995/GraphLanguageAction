Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCCCC[N+](CC)(CC)CCCCc1ccc(Cl)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a long alkyl chain and a nitrogen atom with a positive charge, indicating it could interact with receptors or enzymes that have binding sites for lipophilic molecules and positively charged groups.
Step 2: The presence of chlorine atoms in the benzene ring suggests potential interactions with genes involved in drug metabolism or transport, such as those encoding cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP) and multidrug resistance proteins (ABCB1).
Step 3: The cyclic structure with multiple carbon chains might influence genes related to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), given their tendency to bind to hydrophobic ligands and have complex molecular shapes.
Step 4: Given the pattern of substituents, there is a possibility of interaction with genes encoding for various neurotransmitter receptors and transporters, such as DRD2, HTR1A, and SLC6A4, due to their roles in signaling pathways.
Step 5: The overall structure hints at possible interactions with genes involved in inflammatory responses, such as PTGS1, due to the presence of arachidonic acid-like substituents.
