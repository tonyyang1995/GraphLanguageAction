Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])c1ccc([O-])cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a central carbon atom (C) double-bonded to an oxygen atom (O), which forms part of a carbonyl group (C=O). This structure is known as a ketone and is characteristic of many drugs that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 2: Attached to this central carbon are two benzene rings (c1ccc([O-])cc1), which are aromatic and can form hydrogen bonds due to their electron density. Benzene rings are common in molecules that interact with receptors such as adrenergic receptors (e.g., ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (e.g., CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 3: The molecule also contains negatively charged oxygen atoms (O-) attached to the benzene rings. These negative charges can interact electrostatically with positively charged residues in receptor binding sites, particularly in ion channels (e.g., KCNH2) and GPCRs.
Step 4: Given the presence of benzene rings and the ability to form hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions, this molecule is likely to interact with several genes encoding for GPCRs and ion channels. This includes adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), and potassium channels (KCNH2).
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule’s structure suggests potential interactions with genes involved in signaling pathways modulated by neurotransmitters, such as dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) and serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
