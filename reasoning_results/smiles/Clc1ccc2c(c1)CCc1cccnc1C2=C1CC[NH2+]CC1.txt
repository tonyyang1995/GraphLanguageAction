Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Clc1ccc2c(c1)CCc1cccnc1C2=C1CC[NH2+]CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a complex structure including aromatic rings (e.g., benzene rings), heteroatoms such as nitrogen and chlorine, and a positively charged amine group. These features suggest that the molecule could interact with receptors or enzymes that have specific binding sites for aromatic compounds or positively charged groups.
Step 2: Among the provided genes, several are involved in neurotransmitter systems or receptor pathways, which might be relevant if the molecule interacts with these pathways. For example, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 encode serotonin receptors, which often bind to small molecules with aromatic structures and positively charged groups.
Step 3: The presence of a positively charged amine group in the molecule could also suggest interactions with ion channels or transporters, such as those encoded by CACNA1H (calcium channel subunit alpha 1H) and SLC6A4 (solute carrier family 6 member 4, a serotonin transporter).
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's aromatic nature and potential for binding to protein active sites makes it possible that it could interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize many drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 5: Given the detailed structure and potential for interaction with various types of proteins, particularly those involved in neurotransmission and metabolism, the most likely related genes from the provided list include: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CACNA1H, and SLC6A4.
