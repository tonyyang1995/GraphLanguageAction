Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCn1c(=O)c(-c2cc(NC(=O)Nc3ccccc3)c(F)cc2Br)cc2c[n-]c(=NC)cc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with several functional groups including an amide (N=C=O), a benzene ring (c-c), and a fluorine atom (-F). These features suggest that the molecule could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction, metabolism, and receptor binding.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of a benzene ring and a nitrogen atom in the molecule suggests it may be capable of interacting with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are known to bind to various ligands including small molecules. This interaction could involve the ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4 genes, which code for different subtypes of adrenergic and cholinergic receptors.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) and a bromine atom (-Br), which are often found in molecules that inhibit enzymes such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. These enzymes are part of the cytochrome P450 family and play crucial roles in drug metabolism. Therefore, the molecule might have an inhibitory effect on these genes, which are involved in drug metabolism and detoxification processes.
Step 4: The molecule also includes a quinoline-like structure, which is characteristic of many drugs that act as agonists or antagonists at various receptors. This structural feature could potentially interact with HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode serotonin receptors, and KDR, which encodes the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2, involved in cell signaling pathways.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule appears to be related to several genes involved in neurotransmission, signal transduction, and drug metabolism. The related gene names include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and KDR.
