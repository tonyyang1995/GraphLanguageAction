Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCOc1ccc(-c2nnn(CC(=O)c3c[nH]c4ccccc34)n2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains multiple rings, including a benzene ring, which is common in many drug molecules due to its stability and ability to interact with proteins. This structural feature is relevant to several drug targets that are involved in signal transduction pathways, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes like CYP enzymes.
Step 2: The molecule also has a heterocyclic ring system, specifically an imidazole ring, which is known to bind to various receptors and enzymes. This type of functional group is particularly important for interactions with neurotransmitter receptors and certain metabolic enzymes.
Step 3: Given the presence of amide and ester groups in the molecule, it suggests potential for binding to enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those catalyzed by CYP enzymes, which are listed among the genes provided. These enzymes play crucial roles in drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics.
Step 4: The overall structure and functional groups suggest that this molecule could interact with receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways, which aligns with several genes listed, such as DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HRH1, all of which are involved in regulating neurotransmitter function.
Step 5: Considering the pattern of the molecule and its likely interaction with receptors and enzymes, the most closely related genes are those involved in neurotransmission and metabolism. These include DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.
Summary of related gene names: DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
