Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule, CCOC(=O)c1ccc([O-])cc1, has a structure that includes a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an amine group (N), suggesting it could be an organic compound with potential biological activity.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylic acid group indicates the molecule could act as a ligand for receptors that bind acidic molecules, such as certain G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or ion channels. This feature aligns with several genes listed, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, which encode for various types of GPCRs and other receptors.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule's structure might influence its ability to interact with enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYP), which are encoded by genes such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These enzymes play crucial roles in drug metabolism and can affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the molecule.
Step 4: The molecule also contains a phenolic hydroxyl group, which could make it a substrate for enzymes involved in Phase I metabolism, such as those encoded by PTGS1, which encodes cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), an enzyme involved in prostaglandin synthesis.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and potential interactions, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, EGFR, ESR1, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
