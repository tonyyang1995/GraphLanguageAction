Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(CCn2c(=S)[n-]c3ccc(Cl)cc3c2=O)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring, which is characteristic of compounds that may interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature suggests potential interactions with genes encoding GPCRs.
Step 2: The presence of a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) indicates the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes such as CYP2C9, which metabolizes sulfonamides.
Step 3: The aromatic rings and substituents suggest the molecule might have affinity for receptors or transporters involved in neurotransmission or signal transduction pathways, such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and SLC6A4.
Step 4: The molecule's overall structure and functional groups hint at possible interactions with genes involved in neuronal signaling and receptor modulation, including DRD2, HTR1A, and CNR1.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is most likely related to genes involved in neurotransmitter systems and metabolic pathways, specifically: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, and SLC6A4. To Step 5: Summary of related gene names: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, SLC6A4.
