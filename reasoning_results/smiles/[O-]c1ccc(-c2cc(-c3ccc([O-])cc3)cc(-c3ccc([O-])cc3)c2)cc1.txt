Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [O-]c1ccc(-c2cc(-c3ccc([O-])cc3)cc(-c3ccc([O-])cc3)c2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples.
Step 1: The given molecule contains multiple oxygen atoms, including negatively charged oxyanions, which suggests it has a strong polar character. This feature could potentially interact with membrane proteins that have specific binding sites for polar molecules.
Step 2: The molecular structure includes a benzene ring system, which is common in many drugs and can interact with various enzymes and receptors. Benzene rings are often involved in forming hydrogen bonds and π-π stacking interactions with proteins.
Step 3: The presence of a heterocyclic ring (likely an oxazole or thiazole) in the molecule indicates potential interactions with enzymes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are known to metabolize heterocyclic compounds. These enzymes play a role in drug metabolism.
Step 4: The molecule's overall shape and functional groups may allow it to interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and DRD2, which are involved in neurotransmission. The aromatic rings and polar groups could fit into the binding pockets of these receptors.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and potential interactions, the related genes include CYP2C9, CYP2C19, HTR2A, HTR2B, and DRD2. These genes encode enzymes involved in drug metabolism and receptors that mediate the effects of neurotransmitters.
