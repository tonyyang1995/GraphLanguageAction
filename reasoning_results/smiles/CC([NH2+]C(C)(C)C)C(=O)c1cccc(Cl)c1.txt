Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC([NH2+]C(C)(C)C)C(=O)c1cccc(Cl)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound with a benzene ring, an amide group, and several alkyl chains attached to it. It contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (NH2+), indicating it has basic properties. The presence of this positively charged nitrogen and the overall structure suggests that the molecule could interact with receptors or enzymes that have specific binding sites for such structures.
Step 2: Looking at the genes listed, those involved in neurotransmitter systems and receptor functions are particularly relevant. Genes like DRD2 (Dopamine Receptor D2), HTR1A (Serotonin Receptor 1A), HTR2A (Serotonin Receptor 2A), HTR2B (Serotonin Receptor 2B), and HTR2C (Serotonin Receptor 2C) encode for various types of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). These receptors often bind to molecules with similar structural features to the given molecule, including positively charged nitrogen atoms and hydrophobic alkyl chains.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule's basic nature and its potential to form hydrogen bonds with proteins might make it relevant to genes encoding ion channels or transporters, such as KCNH2 (Potassium Voltage-Gated Channel Subfamily H Member 2) and SLC6A4 (Solute Carrier Family 6 Member 4). Both of these genes are involved in the transport of ions and neurotransmitters across cell membranes, respectively.
Step 4: The presence of an amide group in the molecule also suggests possible interactions with enzymes that metabolize drugs or other small molecules, such as those encoded by CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These cytochrome P450 enzymes are involved in the metabolism of many pharmaceuticals and xenobiotics.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and the potential interactions described, the related genes include: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, KCNH2, SLC6A4, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These genes play crucial roles in neurotransmission and drug metabolism, making them the most likely candidates for interaction with the given molecule.
