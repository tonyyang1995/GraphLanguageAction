Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+]1CCC(=C2c3ccccc3Sc3ccccc32)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure containing a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (N+), which suggests it could act as an electrophile or a nucleophile in biochemical reactions. This feature is relevant to enzymes that might interact with such functional groups, particularly those involved in metabolism or transport processes.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a benzene ring with a sulfoxide group (S(O)), indicating potential interactions with proteins that have sulfhydryl groups (thiols) or other sulfur-containing functionalities. This is significant for enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYP) that often metabolize drugs and xenobiotics, which contain sulfur atoms.
Step 3: The presence of multiple aromatic rings (benzene and phenyl groups) and their connectivity suggest the molecule may be able to form π-π stacking interactions with DNA or other aromatic proteins. This is particularly relevant to genes involved in signal transduction pathways, transcription factors, or DNA binding proteins.
Step 4: Given the diverse functional groups and overall complexity of the molecule, it is likely to interact with various proteins involved in receptor-mediated signaling, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This aligns with genes like DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode for dopamine and serotonin receptors, respectively.
Step 5: The molecule’s ability to form hydrogen bonds and its size suggest it could also interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. These enzymes are crucial for the biotransformation of many pharmaceuticals and xenobiotics.
Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2
- DRD3
- DRD4
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- HTR6
- CYP1A2
