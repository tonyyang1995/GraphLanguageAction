Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1[n-]c(=S)[n-]c(-c2ccccc2)c1Cc1c([O-])ccc2ccccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex structure containing multiple rings, a sulfur atom, and a nitrogen atom with negative charges. The presence of a sulfur-nitrogen double bond suggests the molecule may interact with proteins that contain sulfhydryl groups or have specific binding sites for such functional groups.
Step 2: Considering the pattern of the molecule, it includes several aromatic rings, which are common in ligands that bind to receptors or enzymes. The aromatic nature could indicate potential interactions with genes encoding receptors or enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 3: The negative charge on the nitrogen atoms implies that the molecule might be an anion or a negatively charged compound, which could interact with positively charged residues in proteins. This property could be relevant for genes encoding ion channels or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 4: Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, the molecule likely interacts with a wide range of proteins rather than just a few specific genes. However, considering the provided list of genes, some are more likely to be directly influenced by such a molecule due to their involvement in neurotransmission and signaling pathways.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the genes that are most likely to be related to this molecule include those involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode serotonin receptors; and CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4, which encode muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.
