Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(CC[NH+]1CC[NH+](Cc2ccccc2)CC1)N=c1[n-]ccs1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a quinoline-like structure, which is common in many drugs that interact with receptors and ion channels. This structure is relevant to several genes involved in receptor function and signaling.
Step 2: The molecule also has a pyrrole ring system, which is often found in compounds that modulate G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are encoded by genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, indicating potential interactions with these genes.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a benzene ring with a carboxamide group suggests a possible interaction with enzymes like CYP2D6 and CYP2C9, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs.
Step 4: The molecule's overall structure, particularly the presence of a quinoline core and the carboxamide group, points to potential interactions with genes encoding for receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism, such as those listed in Steps 2 and 3.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2D6, and CYP2C9. These genes are involved in neurotransmitter receptors and drug metabolism.
