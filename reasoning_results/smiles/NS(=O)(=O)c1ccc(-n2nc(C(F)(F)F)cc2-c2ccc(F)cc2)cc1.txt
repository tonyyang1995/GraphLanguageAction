Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring fused to an oxazole ring, which is a common pharmacophore for compounds that interact with neurotransmitter receptors. This structural feature suggests potential interaction with genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes involved in neurotransmission.
Step 2: The presence of fluorine atoms (F) attached to aromatic rings indicates potential interactions with genes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize fluorinated compounds.
Step 3: The molecule includes a quinoline moiety, which is often found in compounds that bind to ion channels and receptors, particularly those associated with adrenergic and cholinergic systems. This structural element points towards possible interactions with genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 4: The molecule also has a benzene ring with a nitro group (-NO2), which can act as a potent activator of certain receptor types and is often involved in the regulation of signaling pathways. This feature may suggest interactions with genes such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which encode serotonin receptors.
Step 5: Given the molecular structure and its functional groups, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and SLC6A4.
