Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])CC(O)(CC(=O)[O-])C(=O)[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a molecule that contains a carbonyl group (C=O) and several functional groups such as esters (O-) and amides (N-). This structure suggests the molecule is likely an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes involved in drug metabolism or signaling pathways.
Step 2: Given the presence of multiple ester and amide groups, this molecule could interact with enzymes that catalyze their formation or cleavage, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These cytochrome P450 enzymes are known to metabolize a wide range of drugs, including those that affect neurotransmitter systems.
Step 3: The molecule also has a pattern that could suggest interaction with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which include DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, and others. GPCRs often bind ligands that have hydrophobic cores and polar or charged functional groups, which aligns with the esters and amides present in the molecule.
Step 4: Considering the potential for the molecule to inhibit or activate enzymes and GPCRs, it may also influence downstream signaling pathways. For instance, CYP enzymes can affect the levels of neurotransmitters like dopamine, which is associated with DRD2 and other dopamine receptors.
Step 5: Based on the structure and functional groups, the molecule could be related to the following genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, and HTR2B. These genes encode proteins that are involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmission, making them relevant to the molecule's potential biological activity.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- DRD2
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
These genes are central to drug metabolism and neurotransmitter signaling, making them key targets for molecules with the described structure.
