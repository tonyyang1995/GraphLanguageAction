Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NC(=O)c1cccc(N)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound that includes a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (pyrrole) attached to an amide group and a benzene ring with multiple substituents. This structure suggests it may be a ligand for various receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring, which is characteristic of many G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are involved in signal transduction pathways and often have ligands that interact with them. Notable GPCRs among the listed genes include CHRM1 (cholinergic receptor, muscarinic M1), CHRM3 (cholinergic receptor, muscarinic M3), and CHRM4 (cholinergic receptor, muscarinic M4).
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule has a benzene ring with substituents, which could potentially interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) due to their role in drug metabolism. The CYP family includes CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
Step 4: The presence of an amide group might also suggest interaction with enzymes such as CYP3A4, which is known to metabolize compounds with amide bonds.
Step 5: Given the structural features of the molecule, it is likely to interact with several of the listed genes, particularly those involved in neurotransmission (e.g., CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) and drug metabolism (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
