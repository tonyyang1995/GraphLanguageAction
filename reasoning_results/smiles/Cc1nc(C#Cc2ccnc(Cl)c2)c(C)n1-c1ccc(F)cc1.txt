Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1nc(C#Cc2ccnc(Cl)c2)c(C)n1-c1ccc(F)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings and functional groups, including a benzene ring, a pyrrole ring, and various substituents such as methyl, chlorine, and fluorine. This structure suggests that it may interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways or transport mechanisms.
Step 2: Notably, the molecule contains a quinolone-like moiety (C#Cc2ccnc(Cl)c2), which is known to be a common structural feature of many drugs that act as inhibitors of enzymes such as topoisomerases or DNA-dependent RNA polymerases. This suggests potential interactions with genes encoding enzymes involved in DNA metabolism or signaling pathways.
Step 3: The presence of fluorine and chlorine atoms, particularly in the substituted aromatic rings, indicates that the molecule might exhibit high lipophilicity, which could influence its ability to cross cell membranes and interact with intracellular targets. This property is relevant for genes involved in cellular transport mechanisms or drug metabolism.
Step 4: Given the complex structure and the presence of functional groups that could potentially form hydrogen bonds or other types of interactions with proteins, the molecule might interact with receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmission, hormone signaling, or inflammatory responses. This is supported by the presence of substituents like -F and -Cl, which are often found in ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule could have potential interactions with several genes, including those encoding GPCRs (e.g., CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), enzymes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism (e.g., CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), and transporters (e.g., SLC6A2, SLC6A4). It may also interact with genes involved in inflammation (e.g., PTGS1) and receptor signaling (e.g., HRH1).
Summary of related gene names:
- CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4
- SLC6A2, SLC6A4
- PTGS1
- HRH1
Note: The summary includes genes that are likely to be directly affected by the molecule's structure and function based on the described steps. Other genes listed in the original prompt may not have an obvious direct relationship with this particular molecule's structure. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings and functional groups, including a benzene ring, a pyrrole ring, and various substituents such as methyl, chlorine, and fluorine. This structure suggests that it may interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways or transport mechanisms.
Step 2: The presence of a quinolone-like moiety (C#Cc2ccnc(Cl)c2) indicates potential interactions with enzymes such as topoisomerases or DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, which are encoded by genes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D
