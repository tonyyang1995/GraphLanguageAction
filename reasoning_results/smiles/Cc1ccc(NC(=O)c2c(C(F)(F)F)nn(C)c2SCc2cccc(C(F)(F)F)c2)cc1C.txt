Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(NC(=O)c2c(C(F)(F)F)nn(C)c2SCc2cccc(C(F)(F)F)c2)cc1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure containing a benzene ring with multiple substituents, including a pyrrole ring, a thioether group, and several fluorine atoms. This structure suggests that the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors involved in signal transduction or drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a thioether group and a carboxamide (N-C=O) group indicates that the molecule might interact with proteins that have thiol groups or are involved in acetylation or deacetylation processes, such as some members of the GPCR family (e.g., ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2).
Step 3: The molecule also contains a quinoline-like structure, which is often found in ligands for nuclear receptors like the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG), which is included in the list of genes.
Step 4: Given the overall structure and potential functional groups, this molecule could potentially inhibit or activate enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 5: Considering the possible interactions and functions of the molecule, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, PPARG, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. These genes encode proteins that may be directly or indirectly affected by the molecule through their involvement in signaling pathways or drug metabolism. Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, PPARG, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4. 
Note: The molecule's interaction with other genes listed in the query may be less direct or not well-supported based on its current structural information, but further investigation would be needed to confirm any indirect relationships. The summary focuses on the most likely candidates given the molecular structure.
