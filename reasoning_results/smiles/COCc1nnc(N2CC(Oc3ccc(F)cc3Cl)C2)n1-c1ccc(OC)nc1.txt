Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COCc1nnc(N2CC(Oc3ccc(F)cc3Cl)C2)n1-c1ccc(OC)nc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains multiple rings and functional groups including a pyrrole ring, furan ring, and amide group. These structural features are often involved in interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring with fluorine substituent and a chlorine atom suggests potential interactions with enzymes like CYP2C19 and CYP2C9, which metabolize drugs containing similar functional groups.
Step 3: The molecule has a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic structure that could interact with GPCRs such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and HRH1, known for binding to amine-containing ligands.
Step 4: The presence of an aromatic amine and an ester group might indicate interaction with enzymes involved in drug metabolism like CYP2D6 and CYP3A4.
Step 5: Given the molecule’s complex structure and potential to interact with multiple receptors and enzymes, it is most likely related to the following genes: CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1. Step 5: Summary of related gene names: CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1.
