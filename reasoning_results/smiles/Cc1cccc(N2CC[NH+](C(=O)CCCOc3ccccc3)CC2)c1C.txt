Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cccc(N2CC[NH+](C(=O)CCCOc3ccccc3)CC2)c1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex molecule that contains a benzene ring with multiple substituents, including a nitrogen atom, a carboxylic acid group, and an amide linkage. This structure suggests the molecule could be a potential ligand or inhibitor for enzymes or receptors.
Step 2: Among the listed genes, those primarily involved in drug metabolism and receptor signaling are likely to interact with this molecule. Specifically, genes encoding enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are involved in phase I metabolic reactions, might be relevant due to the presence of functional groups like the amide and carboxylic acid in the molecule.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a nitrogen atom and potential for forming hydrogen bonds indicates that the molecule might interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as DRD2, DRD3, and HTR2A, which are encoded by the genes DRD2, DRD3, and HTR2A respectively. These receptors are known to bind to small molecules through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding.
Step 4: The molecule's structure also suggests it might have some affinity for ion channels, such as KCNH2, which encodes the HERG potassium channel. The presence of aromatic rings and polar functional groups could potentially modulate the activity of ion channels.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the genes related to this molecule are: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, HTR2A, and KCNH2. These genes encode proteins involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmitter signaling, which are directly or indirectly influenced by the molecule's chemical structure.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, HTR2A, KCNH2.
