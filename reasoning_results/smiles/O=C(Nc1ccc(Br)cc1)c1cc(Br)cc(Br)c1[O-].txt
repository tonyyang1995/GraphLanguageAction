Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Nc1ccc(Br)cc1)c1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound with a central carbon atom double-bonded to a nitrogen atom, which is further bonded to a benzene ring containing a bromine substituent. This core structure is reminiscent of certain pharmacological agents that interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), a class of proteins often involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The bromine atoms attached to the benzene rings and the negatively charged oxygen atom could potentially act as ligands for various GPCRs, which are known to bind to small molecules such as neurotransmitters and hormones. The presence of multiple bromine atoms suggests the molecule might have a broad spectrum of activity, possibly interacting with several different receptor types.
Step 3: Considering the structure and potential binding sites, the molecule could be related to genes encoding GPCRs, such as those listed in the provided gene list. Specifically, it may interact with receptors like HTR2A (serotonin 5-HT2A receptor), HTR2B (serotonin 5-HT2B receptor), and HTR2C (serotonin 5-HT2C receptor), all of which are part of the serotonin signaling pathway and are known to play roles in mood regulation, cognition, and psychiatric disorders.
Step 4: The molecule might also interact with other receptors listed in the gene list, such as DRD2 (dopamine D2 receptor), DRD3 (dopamine D3 receptor), and DRD4 (dopamine D4 receptor), which are involved in the dopamine signaling pathway and are associated with neurological and psychiatric conditions.
Step 5: Based on the structure and potential interactions, the related gene names are: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
Summary of related gene names:
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- HTR6
- DRD2
- DRD3
- DRD4 Step 5: Based on the structure and potential interactions, the related gene names are: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4. Summary of related gene names:
- DRD4
These genes encode receptors that are likely targets for the described molecule due to its potential to interact with them through its chemical structure.
