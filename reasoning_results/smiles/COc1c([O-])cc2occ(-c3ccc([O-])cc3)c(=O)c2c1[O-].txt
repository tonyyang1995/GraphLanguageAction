Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1c([O-])cc2occ(-c3ccc([O-])cc3)c(=O)c2c1[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a series of functional groups including a carboxylic acid (-COOH), a phenolic group (aromatic ring with an -OH), and multiple oxygen-containing heterocycles (such as pyrrole and thiazole). These functional groups suggest that the molecule could be a drug-like compound, potentially targeting receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of an aromatic ring with an -OH group indicates the molecule may have potential to interact with enzymes or receptors that have hydrophobic binding sites and/or contain metal ion binding sites. This suggests the molecule might be related to genes encoding enzymes that involve hydrophobic interactions or metal ion coordination.
Step 3: The carboxylic acid group in the molecule could indicate the molecule has acidic properties and may interact with basic residues in proteins, such as histidines. This suggests the molecule might be related to genes encoding proteins with basic residues.
Step 4: Given the complexity and the presence of various functional groups, the molecule likely targets multiple pathways or receptors, which could be associated with several genes. For instance, it could interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to its structural diversity, suggesting possible relationships with genes like HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HRH1, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 5: Additionally, due to the presence of a thiazole ring, the molecule might have affinity for enzymes or receptors involved in the metabolism or signaling pathways of neurotransmitters, such as those encoded by CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are known to be involved in the metabolism of drugs.
