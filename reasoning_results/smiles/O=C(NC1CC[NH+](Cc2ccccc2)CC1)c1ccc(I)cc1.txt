Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(NC1CC[NH+](Cc2ccccc2)CC1)c1ccc(I)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains an imidazole ring, which is characteristic of imidazoline ligands. This structural feature is relevant to the ADRA2B gene, which encodes the α2B-adrenergic receptor that binds imidazoline ligands.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a pyridine ring, suggesting potential interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are involved in the metabolism of various drugs including those affecting neurotransmitter systems.
Step 3: The presence of a benzene ring and carboxamide group indicates possible interactions with genes encoding transporters like SLC6A2 and SLC6A4, which are involved in the reuptake of monoamines such as norepinephrine and serotonin.
Step 4: The molecule’s overall structure, particularly the presence of nitrogen-containing heterocycles, could interact with receptors such as HTR2A (serotonin 5-HT2A receptor) and HTR2B (serotonin 5-HT2B receptor), which are associated with neurotransmission and psychiatric disorders.
Step 5: The molecule does not directly align with the functions of other listed genes such as ABL1, CDK2, or PTGS1, as its primary structural features do not suggest immediate involvement with their encoded proteins' activities.
Summary of related gene names: ADRA2B, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, HTR2A, HTR2B. Step 1: The molecule contains an imidazole ring, which is characteristic of imidazoline ligands. This structural feature is relevant to the ADRA2B gene, which encodes the α2B-adrenergic receptor that binds imidazoline ligands.
Summary of related gene names: ADRA2B, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, HTR2A, HTR2B.
