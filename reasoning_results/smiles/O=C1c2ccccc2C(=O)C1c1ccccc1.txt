Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C1c2ccccc2C(=O)C1c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system and a pyrrole ring fused to it, forming a heterocyclic structure. This pattern is relevant to several genes involved in drug metabolism and receptor signaling, such as CYP enzymes and receptors like G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) and an amide group (-CONH-) suggests potential interactions with proteins that have similar functional groups, which could be relevant for genes encoding GPCRs and enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 3: The overall structure includes multiple hydrophobic substituents, indicating the molecule may interact with membrane-bound proteins, which are often associated with genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 4: The presence of a benzene ring with electron-withdrawing groups might indicate the molecule could act as a ligand for certain nuclear receptors, such as those encoded by NR1H2 (LXRα) and NR1H3 (LXRβ), though these are not listed among the provided genes.
Step 5: Considering the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the most likely related genes from the given list include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, ESR1, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
Summary of related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, ESR1, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
