Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOc1nc2cccc(C(=O)OC(C)OC(=O)OC3CCCCC3)c2n1Cc1ccc(-c2ccccc2-c2nn[n-]n2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound, which appears to be a benzodiazepine derivative based on its structure. Benzodiazepines are known for their interactions with GABAA receptors, particularly the alpha subunits (e.g., ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2). The presence of multiple rings, a heterocyclic nitrogen, and a carboxamide group are characteristic features of benzodiazepines that suggest potential interaction sites with these receptors.
Step 2: The molecule also contains a quinolone-like structure, which might indicate an interaction with other receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism or signaling pathways. Quinolones are known to interact with various enzymes such as CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs and endogenous substances.
Step 3: The presence of a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid ester group suggests potential interactions with enzymes like CYP3A4, which metabolizes numerous drugs and xenobiotics, including those with similar structures.
Step 4: Given the complex structure and the presence of multiple functional groups, this molecule could potentially interact with a variety of receptors and enzymes. However, the most likely candidates among the provided list would be those involved in neurotransmitter signaling and drug metabolism, such as GABAA receptor subunits (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), and possibly others depending on the exact mechanism of action.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. These genes encode proteins that are directly involved in the binding or metabolism of the described molecule.
