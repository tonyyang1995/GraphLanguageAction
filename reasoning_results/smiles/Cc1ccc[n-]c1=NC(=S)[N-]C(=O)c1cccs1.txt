Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc[n-]c1=NC(=S)[N-]C(=O)c1cccs1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule contains several functional groups including an amide (C(=O)N), a nitrile (-N#C), and a thiol (-CS). These functional groups are indicative of potential interactions with receptors or enzymes that have specific binding sites for these moieties.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a cyclic amine group which could interact with receptors that bind amines, such as some G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This is particularly relevant to the genes that code for various types of GPCRs like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a sulfhydryl group (-CS) suggests possible interaction with cysteine residues in proteins, which might be relevant to genes encoding for proteins with such residues, such as PTGS1 and SLC6A4.
Step 4: The overall structure and functional groups of the molecule suggest it may have affinity for enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, given their roles in metabolizing drugs with similar chemical structures.
Step 5: Based on the above structural analysis, the related genes to this molecule include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, PTGS1, SLC6A4, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. 
Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, PTGS1, SLC6A4, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
