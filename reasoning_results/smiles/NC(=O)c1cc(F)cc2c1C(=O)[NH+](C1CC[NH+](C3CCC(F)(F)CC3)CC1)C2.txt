Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NC(=O)c1cc(F)cc2c1C(=O)[NH+](C1CC[NH+](C3CCC(F)(F)CC3)CC1)C2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex molecule with multiple functional groups and substructures, including a pyridine ring, amide bonds, and a phenyl ring. These features suggest the molecule could be a drug-like compound with potential interactions with receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: Upon closer inspection, the presence of an amide group (N=C=O) and a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) are notable. Amides are common in many drugs that act as agonists or antagonists for various receptors, while phenolic hydroxyl groups can participate in hydrogen bonding and can be recognized by certain enzymes involved in metabolism.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a quaternary ammonium group ([NH+]), which is characteristic of positively charged compounds. Such groups can interact with negatively charged sites on proteins, potentially modulating their activity. This feature suggests the molecule might have affinity for ion channels or receptors that contain such binding sites.
Step 4: Considering the potential interactions of this molecule with the listed genes, it is most likely to interact with those encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), ion channels, and enzymes involved in drug metabolism. Specific candidates include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HRH1, LCK, PTGS1, and SLC6A4.
Step 5: In summary, the related genes to the described molecule are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HRH1, LCK, PTGS1, and SLC6A4. These genes encode proteins that could directly interact with the molecule or are involved in its metabolism and clearance from the body.
