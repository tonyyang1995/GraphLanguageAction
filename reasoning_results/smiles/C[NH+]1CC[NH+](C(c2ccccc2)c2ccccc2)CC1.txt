Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+]1CC[NH+](C(c2ccccc2)c2ccccc2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this relationship might be clinically relevant.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (N+), which is part of a larger structure that includes aromatic rings and alkyl chains. This type of functional group and structural pattern can interact with proteins involved in neurotransmission and receptor binding.
Step 2: The presence of multiple nitrogen-containing heterocycles, such as pyrrolidinyl and piperidinyl groups, suggests potential interactions with receptors that have similar chemical moieties, like adrenergic receptors (e.g., ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (e.g., CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 3: The molecule also has a benzene ring with a cyano group (-CN), which could interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4.
Step 4: Given the complexity of the molecule, it likely has multiple binding sites and modes of action, which may involve various signaling pathways and receptors, including those encoded by DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are associated with serotonin receptors.
Step 5: Considering the diverse structural features and potential binding sites, the molecule may be related to several genes involved in neurotransmission and receptor binding, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Summary of related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
