Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NS(=O)(=O)c1cc2c(cc1Cl)[NH+]=C(CSCc1ccccc1)NS2(=O)=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound containing several functional groups such as a nitrile (N#), a sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)), a chloride (Cl), an amide (N=), a thiocarbamate (SC), and a carboxylic acid (O=O) group. This structure suggests that it may interact with proteins involved in signaling pathways, transport, and metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrile group and a sulfonyl group indicates that this molecule could be an inhibitor or substrate for enzymes involved in drug metabolism. Specifically, the sulfonyl group is a common feature in drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. These enzymes play crucial roles in the metabolism of many drugs, including those affecting neurotransmission and hormone regulation.
Step 3: The thiocarbamate group in the molecule might interact with receptors or enzymes that contain thiol groups, such as cysteine residues. This interaction could potentially affect the activity of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are known to be regulated by ligands that bind to specific amino acid residues. The related genes include HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode serotonin receptors, and CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4, which encode muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.
Step 4: The carboxylic acid group in the molecule could indicate that it is a potential ligand for proteins that recognize acidic moieties, such as certain ion channels or transporters. For example, SLC6A2 (noradrenaline transporter) and SLC6A4 (serotonin transporter) are known to bind to acidic molecules. Additionally, the carboxylic acid group could also interact with the cytosolic domains of certain receptors, such as the adrenergic receptors ADRA1D, ADRA2B, and ADRB2, which have hydrophobic binding pockets that can accommodate such groups.
Step 5: The overall structure of the molecule suggests that it may have multiple pharmacological effects, possibly interacting with several of the listed genes. However, based on the specific functional groups identified, the most likely related genes are those involved in neurotransmission and hormone regulation, including HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4.
