Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1[n-]c2ccccc2n1CCC[NH+]1CCC(n2c(=O)[n-]c3cc(Cl)ccc32)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrile group (-N=C=O) and a quinoline-like structure (quinoline is a common scaffold in many drugs). This structural feature is often associated with drugs that interact with enzymes involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction.
Step 2: The presence of a pyridine ring (a six-membered aromatic ring containing a nitrogen atom) suggests potential interactions with enzymes such as CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, which are known to metabolize a wide range of drugs, including those with pyridine moieties.
Step 3: The molecule also includes an amide group (-CO-NH-) and a carboxylate group (-COOH), which can form hydrogen bonds and contribute to binding interactions with receptors like GPCRs (G protein-coupled receptors), particularly those involved in neurotransmitter signaling.
Step 4: Given the presence of multiple aromatic rings and potential hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, this molecule could interact with several GPCRs, including HTR2A (serotonin receptor), HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, all of which play roles in serotonin signaling pathways.
Step 5: The molecule's structure also aligns with the pharmacophoric features required for binding to other receptors, such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are dopamine receptors involved in various neurological functions.
