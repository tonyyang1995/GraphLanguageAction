Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COC(=O)CCCCC(=O)NCC[NH+]1C(=O)c2cccc3c(Sc4ccc(Br)cc4)ccc(c23)C1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is common in many drug-like molecules. This structural feature can interact with various receptors and enzymes encoded by the genes listed.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH-) suggests potential interactions with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as adrenergic and muscarinic receptors, which are involved in neurotransmission and are encoded by several genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a quinone moiety, which could indicate potential interaction with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4.
Step 4: The overall structure hints at possible interactions with kinases, given its size and complexity, which might be relevant to genes like LCK and MCL1.
Step 5: Given the presence of a benzene ring and amide group, the molecule could potentially interact with ion channels and transporters, suggesting relevance to genes like KCNH2 and SLC6A4.
