Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C1Cc2c([nH]c3ccc(Br)cc23)-c2ccccc2N1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a quinoline-like structure with a nitrogen atom that can form hydrogen bonds, and a bromine atom which is a halogen. This structure is not directly indicative of any particular gene but suggests potential interactions with proteins that have hydrogen bonding capabilities or that are involved in metabolism of halogenated compounds.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a pyridine ring system and a carboxamide group (-CONH2), which are common in ligands for various receptors and enzymes. These functional groups could potentially interact with receptors such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other signaling molecules.
Step 3: Given the presence of the pyridine ring and the carboxamide group, this molecule might interact with genes encoding for receptors like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, as these genes encode for GPCRs that can bind to ligands with similar chemical structures.
Step 4: The molecule’s carboxamide group and its overall structure may also be relevant to genes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, due to their role in metabolizing drugs with similar functional groups.
Step 5: Based on the structure and potential interactions, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. Step 5: **Summary of Related Genes:** ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
