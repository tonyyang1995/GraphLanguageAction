Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(=O)c1cccc(NC(=O)CCC2CCCC2)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other type of explanation.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system and an amide group, which are common structural features in many drugs that interact with receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring suggests potential interactions with genes involved in signal transduction pathways and receptor binding, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, and HRH1.
Step 3: The amide group indicates possible involvement with enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize various drugs.
Step 4: The molecule also includes a nitrogen atom that could participate in hydrogen bonding, potentially affecting genes like HTR2A and HTR2B, which encode serotonin receptors.
Step 5: Given the complex structure with multiple functional groups, the molecule may have broader effects, but the primary related genes are likely to be those involved in receptor binding and drug metabolism.
Related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A, HTR2B. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system and an amide group, which are common structural features in many drugs that interact with receptors and enzymes.
