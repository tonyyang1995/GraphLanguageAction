Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(=O)OCC(CCn1cnc2c[n-]c(=N)nc21)COC(C)=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex structure that includes a benzene ring system, an amide group (-CO-NH-), and a heterocyclic ring (quinoline-like). The presence of the amide group suggests the molecule could act as a modulator of proteins containing amide-binding sites, such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 2: The quinoline-like heterocyclic ring and the presence of nitrogen atoms indicate potential interactions with enzymes or transporters involved in metabolism or transport processes. This is relevant to genes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to be involved in the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: The benzene ring system and the presence of aromatic nitrogen atoms suggest the molecule might interact with ion channels or receptors that contain similar structural motifs. Genes such as KCNH2, which encodes the hERG potassium channel, and HTR2A, which codes for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, are likely candidates due to their involvement in ion channel function and neurotransmitter signaling.
Step 4: The presence of a quinoline-like structure also indicates potential binding to nuclear receptors, which are transcription factors that regulate gene expression. Genes like NR1H2 (LXRα) and NR1H3 (LXRβ) fall into this category, as they are involved in lipid metabolism and inflammation.
Step 5: Considering the diverse structural elements of the molecule, it is likely to have multiple modes of action, potentially interacting with several of the listed genes. However, based on the provided information, the most closely related genes are those involved in metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6), ion channel function (KCNH2, HTR2A), and nuclear receptor activity (NR1H2, NR1H3).
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- KCNH2
- HTR2A
- NR1H2
- NR1H3 Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system and an amide group, which are common in drug molecules that interact with proteins.
Step 2: The presence of a quinoline-like heterocyclic ring and nitrogen atoms suggests the molecule may interact with enzymes or transporters, particularly those involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The benzene ring and nitrogen atoms could also indicate interactions with ion channels or receptors, such as the hERG potassium channel encoded by KCNH2 and the serotonin receptor encoded by HTR2A.
Step 4: The quinoline-like structure hints at potential binding to nuclear receptors, which regulate gene expression. Relevant genes include NR1H2 (LXRα) and NR1H3 (LXRβ).
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure, the most likely related genes are those involved in metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6), ion channel function (KCNH2, HTR2A), and nuclear receptor activity (NR1H2, NR1H3).
