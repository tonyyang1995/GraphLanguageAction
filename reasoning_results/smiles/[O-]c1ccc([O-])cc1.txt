Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [O-]c1ccc([O-])cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string [O-]c1ccc([O-])cc1 contains two negatively charged oxygen atoms and a benzene ring structure. The presence of negatively charged groups suggests that this molecule could be an anion or have strong electrostatic interactions, which might influence its binding to certain ion channels or receptors.
Step 2: The benzene ring structure is common in many ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are encoded by several of the listed genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4. Benzene rings often participate in stacking interactions and can form part of the ligand-binding pocket of these receptors.
Step 3: The negatively charged oxygen atoms in the molecule could interact with positively charged residues in the binding pockets of ion channels or receptors, potentially modulating their function. This type of interaction is particularly relevant for genes encoding ion channels like KCNH2 and HRH1, as well as receptors like HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which have charged residues in their binding sites.
Step 4: Considering the structure and charge of the molecule, it might also interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are encoded by the corresponding genes. These enzymes are known to metabolize a wide range of drugs and xenobiotics, and the molecule's negative charges could affect their catalytic activity.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions with various biological targets, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, KCNH2, HRH1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These genes encode proteins that are likely to be influenced by the molecule's structure due to their involvement in receptor binding, ion channel function, and drug metabolism.
