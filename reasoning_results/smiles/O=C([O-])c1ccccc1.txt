Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule, represented by the SMILES string O=C([O-])c1ccccc1, is a negatively charged phenol derivative. This structure includes a benzene ring with an oxygen atom double-bonded to a carbon atom, which is further bonded to a negatively charged oxygen atom, and the benzene ring is also substituted with alkyl chains.
Step 2: The pattern of the molecule suggests it could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes that are involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP (cytochrome P450) genes. The presence of a negatively charged group (-O-) might interact with positively charged sites on these enzymes, affecting their function.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule's structure could potentially bind to receptors, particularly those that have hydrophobic binding pockets, like adrenergic receptors (e.g., ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as HRH1 (histamine H1 receptor).
Step 4: Given the potential interactions with CYP enzymes and receptors, we can infer that this molecule may have effects on genes involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways, including HTR (serotonin receptors) like HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, and other neurotransmitter receptors like CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4 (cholinergic receptors).
Step 5: Based on the structural and functional analysis, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4. 
Summary of Related Genes:
- CYP (Cytochrome P450) family genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4
- Adrenergic receptor genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2
- Histamine receptor gene: HRH1
- Serotonin receptor genes: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- Cholinergic receptor genes: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4
These genes are likely to be affected by the molecule due to its structure and potential interaction mechanisms. Other genes listed may not have a direct relationship based on the provided information.
