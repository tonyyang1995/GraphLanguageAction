Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(C(=O)CSc2nnc(-c3ccco3)c(-c3ccco3)n2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex molecule that includes a benzene ring system, an amide group, and a heterocyclic ring (indicated by the 'S' in the SMILES string). This structure suggests the molecule could be a drug-like compound, potentially interacting with proteins involved in signal transduction or enzymatic activities.
Step 2: Analyzing the chemical structure further, the presence of a benzene ring and an amide group is common in many drugs that target enzymes or receptors. Notably, the benzene ring is often found in ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are encoded by genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4. These genes encode various subtypes of adrenergic and cholinergic receptors, suggesting potential interactions with this molecule.
Step 3: The amide group, which is part of the amide bond in the molecule, can form hydrogen bonds and participate in binding to proteins. This feature is particularly relevant for enzymes such as CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs through phase I reactions. The molecule's ability to interact with these enzymes could influence its pharmacokinetics.
Step 4: Given the complexity of the molecule, it also has potential interactions with genes encoding ion channels and transporters, such as KCNH2 (encoding a voltage-gated potassium channel) and SLC6A4 (encoding a serotonin transporter). These interactions might affect the molecule's electrophysiological properties and reuptake mechanisms, respectively.
Step 5: Considering the described structure and functional groups, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, KCNH2, and SLC6A4. These genes encode proteins that could directly interact with or be affected by the described molecule due to its chemical structure. 
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, KCNH2, SLC6A4.
