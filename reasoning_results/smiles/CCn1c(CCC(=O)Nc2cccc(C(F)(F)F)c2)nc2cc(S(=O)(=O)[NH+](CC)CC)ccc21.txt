Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCn1c(CCC(=O)Nc2cccc(C(F)(F)F)c2)nc2cc(S(=O)(=O)[NH+](CC)CC)ccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound containing several functional groups such as amide (-CONH2), ester (-COOR), aromatic ring (cyclohexane), and halogen substituents (F). This structure suggests it could interact with receptors or enzymes that are involved in signal transduction pathways or metabolic processes.
Step 2: Notably, the molecule contains an amide group (-CONH2) which is a common feature in ligands for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are often involved in signaling cascades mediated by neurotransmitters and hormones, which aligns with some of the listed genes like HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, all of which encode for different subtypes of GPCRs.
Step 3: The presence of aromatic rings and halogen substituents (F) indicates potential for non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, and π-π stacking, which are key modes of action for many drugs targeting various receptors and enzymes.
Step 4: Considering the complexity and the specific functional groups present, this molecule may also be relevant to enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize numerous drugs.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and potential interactions, the related genes include: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These genes are associated with neurotransmitter receptors and drug metabolism pathways, respectively. 
Summary of related genes: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6.
