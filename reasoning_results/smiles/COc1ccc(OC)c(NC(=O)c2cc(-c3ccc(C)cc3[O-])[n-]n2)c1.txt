Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with a benzene ring system, an amide group (-CONH2), a pyridine ring, and a hydroxyl group (-OH). This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes and receptors that have similar functional groups or binding sites.
Step 2: The presence of the amide group (-CONH2) indicates the molecule could interact with enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of various drugs and xenobiotics through processes such as oxidation and hydroxylation. These enzymes are part of the cytochrome P450 family.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a pyridine ring, which might allow it to bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are associated with dopamine signaling pathways. Additionally, the presence of a hydroxyl group could enhance its ability to interact with these receptors due to hydrogen bonding.
Step 4: Given the presence of a benzene ring and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in the form of a carboxamide, the molecule may also interact with ion channels, such as KCNH2, which is involved in cardiac repolarization and could be relevant for drug-drug interactions affecting heart rhythm.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and functional groups, the molecule is most likely to be related to several genes involved in neurotransmitter systems, metabolism, and ion channel function, including CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, and KCNH2.
