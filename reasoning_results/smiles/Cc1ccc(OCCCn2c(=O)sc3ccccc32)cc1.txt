Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(OCCCn2c(=O)sc3ccccc32)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with multiple functional groups including an oxygen-containing heterocyclic ring (oxazole), a phenol group, and a pyridine ring. These structural features suggest that the molecule could potentially interact with proteins involved in neurotransmitter systems, metabolism, or signaling pathways.
Step 2: Among the provided genes, several are known to be involved in neurotransmitter systems and receptor functions. For instance, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 encode for various subtypes of serotonin receptors, which often interact with ligands that contain oxygen and nitrogen functionalities, similar to those present in the molecule.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a pyridine ring, which might be relevant to genes like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4 that encode dopamine receptors. Dopamine receptors typically bind small molecules with aromatic structures, such as pyridines.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are part of the cytochrome P450 family.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its functional groups, the molecule may be related to the following genes: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19.
