Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCOc1ccc(OCCC[NH+]2CCOCC2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure containing multiple rings, including benzene and pyrrole rings, which are common in many pharmacologically active molecules. It also contains a pyridine ring and a carboxylic acid group, which are known for their ability to interact with various receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of an amide (NH+) group suggests that the molecule could act as a reversible inhibitor of certain enzymes or receptors. This feature is particularly relevant to enzymes such as CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are involved in drug metabolism and have amine or amide functional groups that can form hydrogen bonds or other interactions with substrates or inhibitors.
Step 3: The molecule includes a quinoline moiety (quinoline is a nitrogen-containing aromatic heterocycle), which is known to interact with various G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This makes it potentially relevant to GPCRs like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are involved in neurotransmission and are often targeted by drugs affecting dopamine levels in the brain.
Step 4: The presence of an ester group (COO-) in the molecule indicates that it could be a ligand for enzymes such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which is inhibited by compounds with similar structures. This feature is relevant to genes encoding AChE, such as CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4, which are involved in cholinergic signaling.
Step 5: The overall structure and functional groups of the molecule suggest potential interactions with multiple targets, but the primary focus appears to be on enzymes involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and receptors involved in neurotransmission (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
