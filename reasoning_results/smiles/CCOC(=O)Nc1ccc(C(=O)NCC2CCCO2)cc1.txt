Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)Nc1ccc(C(=O)NCC2CCCO2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring, an amide group (-CONH-), and a phenyl ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This structure suggests it could be a derivative of a known drug or a potential inhibitor of enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an amide group (-CONH-) indicates that the molecule might be able to form hydrogen bonds, which are crucial for interactions with proteins, particularly those involved in G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels.
Step 3: The benzene ring and phenyl ring suggest hydrophobic interactions, which are important for binding to receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and cholinergic receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 4: Given the amide and carboxylic acid functionalities, this molecule could potentially interact with enzymes like CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and functional groups, the molecule is likely to have affinity for several neurotransmitter receptors including dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), and opioid receptors (OPRK1).
