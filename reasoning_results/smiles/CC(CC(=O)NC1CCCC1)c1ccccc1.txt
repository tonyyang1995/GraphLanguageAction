Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(CC(=O)NC1CCCC1)c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that includes a benzene ring system with a carboxamide group attached to one of the benzene rings. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in neurotransmission or signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group (CONH2) indicates that this molecule could be an inhibitor or activator of enzymes that metabolize drugs or other small molecules. Several of the listed genes are involved in drug metabolism and transport, such as CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which encode cytochrome P450 enzymes responsible for the biotransformation of various substrates.
Step 3: The benzene ring system might also interact with receptors or ion channels, particularly those associated with neurotransmission or pain modulation. Genes like HTR2A (serotonin receptor), HTR2B (serotonin receptor), HTR2C (serotonin receptor), DRD2 (dopamine receptor), and OPRK1 (opioid receptor) are directly involved in these processes.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure may influence the activity of ion channels, such as KCNH2 (hERG potassium channel). This is relevant because several of the listed genes, including KCNH2, are known to play roles in cardiac function and ion channel regulation.
Step 5: Based on the structural features of the molecule and its potential interactions with enzymes and receptors, the related genes include: CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, OPRK1, and KCNH2.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, OPRK1, KCNH2.
