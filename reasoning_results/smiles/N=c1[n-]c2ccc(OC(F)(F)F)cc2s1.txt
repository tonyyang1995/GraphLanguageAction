Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N=c1[n-]c2ccc(OC(F)(F)F)cc2s1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a triple bond to a carbon atom, indicating it could be involved in binding to proteins that interact with such functional groups, like receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The molecule also has a fluorine-substituted phenolic group, which may interact with enzymes or receptors containing hydrophobic or aromatic binding pockets.
Step 3: The presence of a sulfoxide group suggests potential interaction with enzymes or receptors that have specific binding sites for sulfur-containing compounds.
Step 4: Given the molecular structure, interactions are most likely with genes encoding for receptors (e.g., adrenergic, muscarinic, and dopaminergic receptors) and enzymes involved in drug metabolism (e.g., CYP enzymes).
Step 5: The related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, and HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6. Step 5: Related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
