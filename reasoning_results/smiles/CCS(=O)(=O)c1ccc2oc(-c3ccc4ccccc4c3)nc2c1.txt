Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCS(=O)(=O)c1ccc2oc(-c3ccc4ccccc4c3)nc2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that includes a core structure of a benzene ring (CC), a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and an amide group (-CONH-). This structure is indicative of a compound likely to interact with enzymes or receptors involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: Analyzing the gene list provided, we find several genes encoding for receptors and enzymes that could potentially interact with such a molecule. For instance, CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) are known to metabolize various compounds, including those with a benzene ring and functional groups like carboxylic acids and amides.
Step 3: The presence of an amide group suggests possible interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are common targets for drugs due to their role in signaling pathways. Among the listed genes, HTR2A (serotonin 5-HT2A receptor), HTR2B (serotonin 5-HT2B receptor), and HTR2C (serotonin 5-HT2C receptor) are GPCRs that could be relevant.
Step 4: Additionally, the benzene ring and carboxylic acid group might also interact with enzymes involved in lipid metabolism, such as PTGS1 (cyclooxygenase 1), which is involved in prostaglandin synthesis.
Step 5: Considering the above structural features, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, PTGS1.
Summary of Related Genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, PTGS1.
