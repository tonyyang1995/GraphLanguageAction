Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(F)c(NC(=O)Nc2ccc(-c3cccc4[n-][n-]c(=N)c34)cc2)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure containing a benzene ring with various substituents such as fluorine, amide, and two nitrogen atoms forming a heterocyclic ring. The presence of a heterocyclic ring and an amide group suggests that this molecule could potentially interact with receptors or enzymes that have similar functional groups.
Step 2: Among the provided genes, those encoding for receptors and enzymes that might interact directly with a molecule featuring these functional groups are likely to be relevant. For instance, receptors that bind small molecules or peptides, and enzymes involved in metabolism could be potential targets.
Step 3: Specific genes like DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), HTR1A (Serotonin receptor 1A), HTR2A (Serotonin receptor 2A), and HTR2B (Serotonin receptor 2B) encode for receptors that may bind to small molecules or peptides due to their binding sites often featuring amino acids that can form hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, which are common in the molecule's structure.
Step 4: Additionally, genes like CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which encode for cytochrome P450 enzymes, could also be relevant as these enzymes are known to metabolize drugs and xenobiotics, including molecules with aromatic rings and amide groups.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and the described interactions, the related genes are: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.
