Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cccc(C)c1NC(=O)COc1ccccc1C(=O)N=c1ccc(Br)c[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure containing multiple rings and functional groups such as amides, esters, and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle. Notably, it contains an amide group (C(=O)NH) and an ester group (C(=O)O), which are common in many pharmacologically active molecules.
Step 2: The presence of these functional groups suggests that the molecule could interact with proteins that contain binding sites for amides or esters, such as receptors or enzymes. Among the provided genes, those encoding receptors or enzymes that might interact with these functional groups include ABL1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and SLC6A2.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a bromine atom (-Br), which is often involved in specific binding interactions with proteins that have particular affinity for halogens. Genes encoding proteins that may interact with this feature include CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize compounds containing halogens.
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule, particularly its aromatic rings and the presence of nitrogen-containing heterocycles, might suggest potential interactions with ion channels or G-protein coupled receptors. Genes such as KCNH2 and HRH1 encode proteins that could be relevant here.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and the potential for interaction with various protein types, the related genes include: ABL1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, KCNH2, HRH1, and SLC6A2.
