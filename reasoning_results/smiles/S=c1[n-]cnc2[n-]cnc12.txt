Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: S=c1[n-]cnc2[n-]cnc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The SMILES string S=c1[n-]cnc2[n-]cnc12 represents a molecule with a sulfur atom (S) double-bonded to a nitrogen atom (N), which is part of a tricyclic structure with two negatively charged nitrogen atoms (-N) attached to the ring system. This molecule likely belongs to a class of drugs known for their interactions with neurotransmitter systems.
Step 2: The tricyclic structure and the presence of nitrogen atoms suggest that this molecule could be a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). TCAs are known to interact with various receptors and enzymes involved in the regulation of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine.
Step 3: Given the interaction profile of TCAs, this molecule is likely to influence the expression or function of several genes related to neurotransmitter receptors and metabolic enzymes. Specifically, it may affect genes encoding for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Step 4: The related genes include those encoding for GPCRs such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, and KDR, which are involved in the regulation of serotonin, dopamine, and acetylcholine signaling pathways. Additionally, it may interact with genes like CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 5: The molecule may also have indirect effects through its influence on downstream signaling pathways involving genes such as PTGS1, which codes for COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes involved in inflammation and pain modulation.
Summary of related gene names:
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4
- CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, KDR
- CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4
- PTGS1
- MCL1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4 (these genes are less directly related but may be influenced through secondary effects) Note: OPRL1 (OPRK1) is not listed as it primarily interacts with opioid ligands, which is not the case for the described molecule. CNR1 is also not included as it primarily interacts with cannabinoids, which is unrelated to the described tricyclic structure. SIGMAR1, LCK, and PPARG are less directly related and may be influenced through secondary effects. CA12, CA2, CA9, CACNA1H, CDK2, ESR1, FLT1, and KDR are less directly related and may be influenced through secondary effects.
