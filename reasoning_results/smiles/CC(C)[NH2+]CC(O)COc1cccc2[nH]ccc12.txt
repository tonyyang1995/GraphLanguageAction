Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)[NH2+]CC(O)COc1cccc2[nH]ccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains an amide group (-CONH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which are common functional groups for ligands that interact with receptors and enzymes. These functional groups suggest potential interactions with proteins that have similar binding sites.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring (C6H5) indicates aromaticity, which is often associated with compounds that can bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to their ability to form π-π stacking interactions with the receptor's transmembrane domains.
Step 3: The molecule has a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (+), which suggests it could be an acetylcholine-like compound. This is relevant because several of the listed genes encode receptors that are activated by acetylcholine, such as CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and HRH1.
Step 4: The presence of an ester group (O=C-O-) and an amide group may indicate the molecule could act as a ligand for enzymes or receptors that recognize these functional groups, such as CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 5: Given the structural features and the potential for interaction with acetylcholine receptors and other neurotransmitter receptors, the related genes include: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Summary of related genes: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
