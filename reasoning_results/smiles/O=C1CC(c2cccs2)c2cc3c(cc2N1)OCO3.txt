Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C1CC(c2cccs2)c2cc3c(cc2N1)OCO3, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a structure that includes a benzene ring (C6H6) attached to a carbonyl group (C=O), which suggests it might be a phenolic compound or an aromatic amide. This structural feature could potentially interact with enzymes involved in metabolism or receptors that bind to aromatic compounds.
Step 2: The presence of a nitro group (NO2) in the molecule is notable. Nitro groups are known to be recognized by certain drug-metabolizing enzymes, particularly those in the cytochrome P450 family, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These enzymes play a crucial role in the biotransformation of xenobiotics and endogenous compounds.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a chiral center (as indicated by the presence of a stereocenter in the cyclic amine structure), which could affect its binding specificity and pharmacological activity. Chiral centers are often found in molecules that interact with receptors or transport proteins, such as DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2) and HTR2A (serotonin receptor 5-HT2A).
Step 4: Given the presence of a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in the molecule, it may have acidic or basic properties, which could influence its solubility and distribution in biological systems. Such properties are relevant to genes involved in ion channel regulation, such as KCNH2 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2), and neurotransmitter transporters, like SLC6A2 (solute carrier family 6 member 2).
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule appears to be related to the following genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A, KCNH2, and SLC6A2. These genes are involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmission, and ion channel function, all of which could be affected by the molecule's chemical structure.
