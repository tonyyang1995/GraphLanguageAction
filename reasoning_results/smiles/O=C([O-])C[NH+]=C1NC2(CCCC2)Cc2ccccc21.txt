Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])C[NH+]=C1NC2(CCCC2)Cc2ccccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains an amide (N-C=O) and an ester (O=C), suggesting it could be a small molecule that interacts with proteins containing amine or carboxylate binding sites.
Step 2: The presence of a negatively charged oxygen (-O-) indicates the molecule could interact with positively charged amino acid residues such as lysine, which are common in protein binding sites.
Step 3: The cyclic structure with multiple carbon atoms suggests the molecule might fit into a hydrophobic pocket of a protein, potentially interacting with proteins involved in lipid metabolism or signaling pathways.
Step 4: Given the molecular structure, it is likely to interact with proteins involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, as these often have hydrophobic binding pockets and can bind molecules with aromatic rings and multiple carbons.
Step 5: Based on the structural features, the molecule could potentially interact with genes encoding for GPCRs and enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and SLC6A4.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- SLC6A4 Step 1: The molecule contains an amide (N-C=O) and an ester (O=C), suggesting it could be a small molecule that interacts with proteins containing amine or carboxylate binding sites.
- SLC6A4
Note: I have maintained the format and steps as per your instructions while providing a concise summary of the related genes based on the molecule's structure and potential interactions. The summary includes the five genes mentioned in the reasoning process. Additional genes like ABL1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, etc., were not included in the final list as they do not directly align with the described structural features of the molecule. However, these genes could still be relevant depending on further analysis of their functional roles. Step 1: The molecule contains an amide (N-C=O) and an ester (O=C), suggesting it could be a small molecule that interacts with proteins containing amine or carbox
