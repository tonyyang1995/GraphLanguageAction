Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cccc(N=c2cc(Cl)[n-]c(SCC(=O)[O-])n2)c1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure containing a benzene ring, a nitrogen atom with a double bond (N=c), a thiophene ring, and a carboxylate group (-COO-). This indicates that the molecule likely interacts with proteins involved in transport, metabolism, and receptor functions.
Step 2: Analyzing the genes listed, we can see that some are related to drug transporters, enzymes involved in metabolism, and receptors. Specifically, ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein) is a well-known drug efflux transporter, while CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) are involved in the metabolism of many drugs.
Step 3: The thiophene ring and carboxylate group in the molecule suggest it might interact with enzymes like CYPs, which often metabolize compounds with these functional groups. Additionally, the presence of a nitrogen with a double bond (N=c) could indicate potential interactions with ion channels or receptors.
Step 4: Given the molecule’s structure, it may also interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as those encoded by ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are known to bind ligands with specific structural features.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ABCB1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes encode proteins that play roles in drug transport, metabolism, and receptor signaling.
