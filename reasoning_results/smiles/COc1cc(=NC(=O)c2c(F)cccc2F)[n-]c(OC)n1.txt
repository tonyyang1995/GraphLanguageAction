Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc(=NC(=O)c2c(F)cccc2F)[n-]c(OC)n1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a phenolic group (-OH) and a cyano group (-CN), which are common functional groups in drugs that interact with receptors and enzymes. This suggests potential interactions with genes encoding receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a nitroimidazole ring in the molecule indicates it may target or interact with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are known to metabolize nitroimidazoles.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a pyridine ring, which is often found in compounds that bind to ion channels and receptors, potentially interacting with genes like KCNH2 (a potassium channel) and possibly others involved in neurotransmission.
Step 4: The overall structure and functional groups suggest the molecule could be a ligand for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are encoded by genes like DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, and HTR2B, among others.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and functional groups, the related genes include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, KCNH2, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B. Step 1: The molecule contains a phenolic group (-OH) and a cyano group (-CN), which are common functional groups in drugs that interact with receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a nitroimidazole ring suggests interaction with metabolic enzymes, particularly CYP2C9 and CYP2C19.
Step 3: The pyridine ring indicates potential binding to ion channels, specifically KCNH2.
Step 4: The structure suggests possible interaction with GPCRs, including DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, and HTR2B.
Step 5: Related genes include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, KCNH2, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B.
