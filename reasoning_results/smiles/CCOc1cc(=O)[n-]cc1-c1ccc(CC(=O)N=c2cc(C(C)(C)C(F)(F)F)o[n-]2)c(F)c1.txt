Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOc1cc(=O)[n-]cc1-c1ccc(CC(=O)N=c2cc(C(C)(C)C(F)(F)F)o[n-]2)c(F)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure including an amide group (-CO-N), a cyclic amine (-N-), and multiple functional groups such as alkyl chains, phenyl rings, and fluorine atoms. This complexity suggests it may interact with proteins that have diverse binding sites.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring (-c1cc(=O)[n-]cc1) and a nitrile group (-c(F)c1) indicate potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism and signaling pathways. Benzene rings are common in many drugs and can interact with proteins through aromatic stacking or hydrogen bonding.
Step 3: The molecule contains a quinolone-like structure (c1ccc(CC(=O)N=c2cc(C(C)(C)C(F)(F)F)o[n-]2)), which is known to interact with various receptors and enzymes. Quinolones are known to bind to DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, suggesting possible interactions with genes encoding these proteins.
Step 4: Given the presence of multiple functional groups and the overall complexity, this molecule might interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, particularly those containing G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This could be relevant for genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and DRD2, which encode for various types of GPCRs.
Step 5: Considering the metabolic and signaling properties of the molecule, it could also interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. These enzymes are crucial for the biotransformation of xenobiotics and drugs.
