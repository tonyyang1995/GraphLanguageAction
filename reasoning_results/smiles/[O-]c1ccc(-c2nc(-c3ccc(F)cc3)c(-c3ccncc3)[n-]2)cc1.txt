Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [O-]c1ccc(-c2nc(-c3ccc(F)cc3)c(-c3ccncc3)[n-]2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a tricyclic structure with a negatively charged oxygen atom (-O-) and fluorine substituents, indicating it may have affinity for receptors that interact with acidic groups or respond to small polar molecules.
Step 2: The presence of a heterocyclic ring system and nitrogen-containing groups suggests potential interactions with proteins such as receptors or transporters that have similar chemical features.
Step 3: The molecule's structure does not directly suggest strong binding or activation of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are often associated with ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
Step 4: The tricyclic structure might be relevant to CYP enzymes, particularly CYP2D6, due to the presence of multiple rings, which could influence drug metabolism, but this is speculative without further testing.
Step 5: Given the molecule's structure and lack of direct alignment with specific pharmacological targets listed, no clear, direct relationship with any of the provided genes can be established based solely on its chemical structure.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2D6
- DRD2
- DRD3
- DRD4 Step 1: The molecule has a tricyclic structure with a negatively charged oxygen atom and fluorine substituents, suggesting potential interactions with acidic groups or small polar molecules.
Step 2: The presence of heterocyclic rings and nitrogen-containing groups indicates possible interactions with proteins like receptors or transporters that have similar chemical features.
Step 3: The molecule's structure does not strongly suggest binding or activation of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are typically associated with ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
Step 4: While the tricyclic structure might be relevant to CYP enzymes, particularly CYP2D6, due to the presence of multiple rings, this is speculative without further testing.
- DRD4
(Note: The final summary includes only the genes mentioned in Steps 4 and 5 as they were the closest matches based on the given structure, though the relationships are speculative.)
