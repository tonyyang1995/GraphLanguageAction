Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)C(C)n1cnc2c(oc3ccccc32)c1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with an amide group (-CO-) attached to it. This structure is characteristic of many drugs that interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are encoded by several genes listed.
Step 2: The amide group can form hydrogen bonds, which is crucial for binding to GPCRs. Additionally, the benzene ring can interact with the transmembrane domains of GPCRs through π-π stacking.
Step 3: The presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) could indicate potential interactions with enzymes such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs.
Step 4: The overall structure suggests the molecule could be a partial agonist or antagonist of a GPCR, given its pattern of functional groups and aromaticity, which are key features in modulating receptor activity.
Step 5: Genes related to this molecule include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, as they encode GPCRs that could potentially interact with this molecule.
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
