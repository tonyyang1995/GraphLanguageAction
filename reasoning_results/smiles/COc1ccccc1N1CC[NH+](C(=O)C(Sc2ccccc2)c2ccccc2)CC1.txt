Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccccc1N1CC[NH+](C(=O)C(Sc2ccccc2)c2ccccc2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a quinoline-like structure, which includes a nitrogen atom in a six-membered ring, and a pyridine-like structure, which also contains a nitrogen atom in a five-membered ring. These aromatic rings are common in ligands that interact with receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The molecule has a benzene ring with a carboxamide group (-CONH2), which can form hydrogen bonds with polar amino acid residues in protein binding sites, particularly in receptors and enzymes.
Step 3: The presence of a benzene ring and a pyridine ring, along with the carboxamide group, suggests potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as adrenergic and cholinergic receptors, as well as enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYPs).
Step 4: Given the structural features, the molecule could potentially interact with several genes involved in neurotransmitter systems and drug metabolism, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and SLC6A4.
Step 5: Additionally, due to the presence of a carboxamide group, the molecule might have interactions with genes involved in the metabolism of drugs that are substrates for CYP enzymes, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4.
