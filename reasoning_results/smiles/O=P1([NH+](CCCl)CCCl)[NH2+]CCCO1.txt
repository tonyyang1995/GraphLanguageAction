Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other type of explanation.
Step 1: The molecule contains a phosphonate group (P=O) and a nitroimidazole ring (N-H), which are characteristic of some ligands that interact with enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of multiple aromatic rings and chlorinated substituents suggests the molecule could act as an inhibitor or modulator of proteins involved in cell signaling and drug metabolism.
Step 3: Given the structure, the molecule might interact with receptors or enzymes encoded by genes involved in neurotransmitter regulation, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Step 4: Specific interactions could be with genes like CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which encode enzymes that metabolize drugs, or with genes encoding GPCRs like DRD2, HTR2A, and HTR2B, which are involved in neurotransmission.
Step 5: The related genes include CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, and HTR2B.
