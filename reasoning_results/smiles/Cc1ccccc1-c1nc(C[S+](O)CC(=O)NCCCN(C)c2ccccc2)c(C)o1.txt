Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccccc1-c1nc(C[S+](O)CC(=O)NCCCN(C)c2ccccc2)c(C)o1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with multiple substituents, including a sulfonamide group (-S+), an amide group (-CONH-), and several alkyl chains. This complex structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes or receptors that are involved in metabolism or signaling pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a sulfonamide group (-S+) indicates that this molecule could be an inhibitor or substrate for enzymes such as cytochrome P450s (CYPs). Specifically, it might interact with CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize sulfonamides and other drugs.
Step 3: The amide group (-CONH-) in the molecule could also suggest interactions with enzymes like CYP3A4, which plays a role in the metabolism of various compounds, including amides.
Step 4: Given the presence of multiple functional groups and its overall complexity, the molecule may interact with receptors or ion channels. For instance, it could potentially affect G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are involved in serotonin signaling.
Step 5: The molecule's structure does not directly suggest strong interactions with other genes listed, such as those encoding kinases (e.g., LCK, KDR), transporters (e.g., SLC6A2, SLC6A4), or transcription factors (e.g., PPARG).
