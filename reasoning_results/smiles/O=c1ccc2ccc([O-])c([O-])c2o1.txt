Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1ccc2ccc([O-])c([O-])c2o1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that contains a benzene ring system with a cyano group (-CN) attached to one of the carbon atoms, and a series of oxygen-containing functional groups including an alcohol (-OH), a ketone (C=O), and two negatively charged oxyanions (O-). This structure suggests the molecule could be involved in interactions with receptors or enzymes that bind to or metabolize similar chemical functionalities.
Step 2: The presence of the cyano group (-CN) and the negatively charged oxyanions (O-) indicates the molecule might interact with ion channels or receptors that have binding sites for negatively charged ligands or ions. This structural feature points towards potential interactions with genes encoding ion channel proteins, such as KCNH2 (a potassium channel subunit) and HRH1 (histamine receptor H1).
Step 3: The presence of an alcohol (-OH) group suggests the molecule may have potential for interaction with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize various substrates containing hydroxyl groups.
Step 4: The overall structure also implies the molecule might be able to interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to its size and functional groups. This is supported by the presence of multiple functional groups that could engage with the receptor's extracellular domain. Potential related genes include HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode serotonin receptors.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and the potential interactions described, the related genes would be: KCNH2, HRH1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes encode proteins that could directly or indirectly interact with the molecule due to their specific binding sites or metabolic pathways.
