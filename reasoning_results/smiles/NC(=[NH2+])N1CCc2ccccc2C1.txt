Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NC(=[NH2+])N1CCc2ccccc2C1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a small organic compound with a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (imidazole) linked to a pyrrolidine ring via an amide bond, forming a cyclic structure. This structure is characterized by the presence of a positively charged amino group attached to the imidazole ring.
Step 2: The pattern of the molecule suggests that it may interact with proteins containing ion channels or receptors, as these often have positively charged residues to bind to ligands or neurotransmitters. This is because the positively charged amino group in the molecule could potentially form hydrogen bonds or electrostatic interactions with negatively charged residues in protein binding sites.
Step 3: Considering the molecular structure, the molecule might be related to genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are involved in signal transduction pathways and neurotransmission. The presence of the imidazole and pyrrolidine rings could suggest potential interaction with GPCRs such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 4: Additionally, the positively charged nature of the molecule could indicate a potential interaction with ion channels, particularly those involved in calcium signaling. This is supported by the presence of CACNA1H, which encodes a voltage-gated calcium channel.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions with protein binding sites, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CACNA1H.
Summary of related gene names:
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- ADRB2
- CHRM1
- CHRM3
- CHRM4
- CACNA1H Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions with protein binding sites, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CACNA1H. 
- CACNA1H
These genes encode proteins that are likely to interact with the described molecule due to their involvement in receptor and ion channel functions. The positively charged amino group and the cyclic structure suggest potential interactions with these specific receptors and ion channels.
