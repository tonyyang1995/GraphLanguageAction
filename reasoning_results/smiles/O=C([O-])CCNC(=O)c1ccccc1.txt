Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])CCNC(=O)c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that includes an aromatic ring system, a carbonyl group, and a negatively charged oxygen atom. These structural features suggest the molecule could be involved in interactions with receptors or enzymes that have similar functional groups.
Step 2: Analyzing the genes provided, we see that several of them are associated with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which often interact with ligands containing aromatic rings and polar functional groups such as carbonyls or hydroxyls. Examples include HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, all of which are serotonin receptors.
Step 3: The negatively charged oxygen in the molecule could potentially interact with positively charged residues in ion channels or other membrane proteins, such as KCNH2, which encodes the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a carbonyl group might indicate the molecule could act as an inhibitor or substrate for enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 5: Based on the molecule’s structural features, the related genes could include: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. These genes encode proteins that may interact directly with or be influenced by the molecule through its chemical structure. 
Summary of related gene names: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4.
