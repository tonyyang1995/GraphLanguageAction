Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC[NH+](Cc1ccncc1)C(=O)C(CO)c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring (N with five carbons) attached to an amide group (-CO-NH+), indicating it is likely an acetylcholine receptor antagonist or agonist. This structure is characteristic of molecules that interact with neurotransmitter receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a phenylalanine (F) and a cyano group (-CN) suggests the molecule may have affinity for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which include many of the listed genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and HRH1. These receptors are involved in various signaling pathways mediated by neurotransmitters like norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, and histamine.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an ester group (-OCO-), which could indicate a potential interaction with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C19 and CYP2D6. These enzymes play a role in the biotransformation of drugs and other xenobiotics.
Step 4: The presence of a pyrimidine ring (C2N2) and a hydroxyl group (-OH) in the molecule might suggest interactions with enzymes or receptors associated with metabolic pathways, such as those encoded by PTGS1 and SLC6A4. PTGS1 encodes cyclooxygenase-1, which is involved in prostaglandin synthesis, while SLC6A4 encodes the noradrenaline transporter.
Step 5: Given the complex structure and the presence of multiple functional groups, this molecule is most likely related to several of the listed genes, including but not limited to: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CNR1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, ESR1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, KDR, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, PPARG, SIGMAR1, and SLC6A2. Step 5: Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CNR1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, ESR1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, KDR, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, PPARG, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2.
