Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)[NH+]2CC[NH+](C(=O)C[NH+]3CC[NH+](C)CC3)C2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a molecule that contains several functional groups including a sulfonyl group (-SO2-), amide groups (-CONH-), and multiple aromatic rings. This suggests the molecule likely interacts with proteins that have binding sites for these functional groups or aromatic regions.
Step 2: Considering the presence of the sulfonyl group, this could potentially interact with cysteine residues via thiolate coordination or inhibit enzymes that contain cysteine-rich active sites, such as certain kinases. However, no specific kinase inhibitors are immediately apparent from the given genes.
Step 3: The amide groups might be involved in hydrogen bonding interactions with proteins, particularly those containing histidine residues which can act as proton donors or acceptors. Genes encoding receptors or transporters with histidine residues in their binding sites could be relevant.
Step 4: Given the aromatic nature of the molecule, it could interact with proteins having hydrophobic binding pockets, such as those found in G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are encoded by genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 5: The molecule’s overall structure does not strongly suggest direct interaction with genes encoding enzymes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4, as these typically require more specific substrate recognition patterns.
