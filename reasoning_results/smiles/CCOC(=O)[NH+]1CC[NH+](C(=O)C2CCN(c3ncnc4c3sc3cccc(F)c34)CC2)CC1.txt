Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)[NH+]1CC[NH+](C(=O)C2CCN(c3ncnc4c3sc3cccc(F)c34)CC2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex molecule that includes functional groups such as an amide (CO), amine (NH2), and aromatic rings. The presence of an amide group suggests the molecule could be a drug-like compound, possibly acting as an inhibitor or agonist of certain receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The aromatic ring system in the molecule, particularly the benzene rings, is characteristic of many drugs and ligands that interact with receptors and enzymes. This pattern is consistent with the interaction of the molecule with membrane-bound proteins, which often have hydrophobic regions that can bind to aromatic compounds.
Step 3: The presence of a carboxamide group (C(=O)N) and an amine group (NH+) indicates potential for ion channel modulation, as these functional groups can form hydrogen bonds with charged amino acid residues in ion channels. Additionally, the carboxamide group might be involved in binding to enzymes like cytochrome P450s, which are known to metabolize a wide range of drugs.
Step 4: Given the structural features mentioned, the molecule could potentially interact with several G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels. This is because the aromatic rings and amine groups suggest interactions with transmembrane domains of GPCRs, while the amide and carboxamide groups could interact with ion channel selectivity filters or regulatory domains.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HRH1, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CNR1, KCNH2, LCK, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, and OPNK1. These genes encode proteins that are involved in drug metabolism (cytochromes P450), neurotransmitter signaling (Dopamine receptors, Serotonin receptors, Histamine receptor, Cannabinoid receptor), and ion channel function (Potassium channel, Lymphocyte tyrosine kinase, Prostaglandin synthase). The interactions of the molecule with these genes could modulate their activity, potentially leading to therapeutic effects or adverse reactions depending on the specific gene and its function.
