Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccccc1NC(=O)C[NH+]1CC[NH+](CC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)c(C(F)(F)F)c2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a pyrrole ring fused to an aromatic ring (indicated by the 'c1ccccc1' part), which is characteristic of many ligands that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature suggests potential interactions with receptors that have similar binding pockets.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a benzene ring with an amide group (-CONH-) and a carboxamide group (-CONH-), which are common functional groups found in drugs that act as agonists or antagonists for various receptors, including GPCRs and ion channels.
Step 3: The presence of multiple substituents such as fluorine (F) and chlorine (Cl) on the aromatic rings could influence the molecule's pharmacokinetic properties, such as its solubility and metabolic stability, which may affect how it interacts with proteins encoded by certain genes.
Step 4: Considering the structural elements and functional groups present, the molecule is likely to interact with GPCRs, which are involved in signaling pathways mediated by neurotransmitters, hormones, and other ligands. This interaction might be relevant to genes encoding GPCRs like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule's ability to modulate GPCR activity could potentially influence downstream signaling pathways involving kinases and other enzymes, making it relevant to genes like CDK2, LCK, and MCL1, which are involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis.
