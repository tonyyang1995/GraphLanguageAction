Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc(N2CCC([NH+]3CC[NH+](C)CC3)CC2)ccc1N=c1[n-]cc(Cl)c(=Nc2ccccc2P(C)(C)=O)[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples or additional text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring, a quinoline ring, and multiple aromatic rings. These structural elements suggest potential interactions with enzymes and receptors involved in signal transduction pathways and drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a quinoline ring and amine functionalities indicate possible interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as adrenergic and muscarinic receptors, which are encoded by genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a phenylpiperidine structure, which may interact with dopaminergic receptors, such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, encoded by the corresponding genes.
Step 4: The presence of a pyridine ring and a piperidine moiety suggests potential interactions with enzymes like CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are encoded by the respective genes, involved in the metabolism of many drugs.
Step 5: The molecule does not show significant structural features that would directly suggest interactions with other listed genes such as ABCB1, EGFR, PTGS1, or others.
