Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCC1(c2ccccc2)NC(=O)[NH+](C)C1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a molecule that includes a benzene ring, a pyrrole ring, an amide group, and a carboxamide group. These structural elements suggest the molecule could be a drug-like compound, specifically a small molecule inhibitor or agonist targeting receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH2) indicates the molecule might be an acetylcholine receptor antagonist or modulator, given that many acetylcholine receptor antagonists and modulators contain such functional groups. This suggests a potential relationship with genes encoding acetylcholine receptors.
Step 3: The amide group (-CONH-) is also common in ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are involved in various physiological processes. Therefore, the molecule might interact with GPCRs encoded by certain genes.
Step 4: Given the structure, the molecule may act as an inhibitor of enzymes like CYP2D6 or CYP2C19, which are known to metabolize drugs. This would make it relevant to genes involved in drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to genes encoding acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4) and GPCRs (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6). Additionally, it might have implications for drug metabolism genes (CYP2D6, CYP2C19).
