Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc2[n-]c(N3CC[NH+](C(=O)c4ccco4)CC3)nc(=N)c2cc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule contains several functional groups including a carboxylic acid (-COOH), an amine (N-), a benzene ring, and a nitro group (-NO2). The presence of a carboxylic acid and an amine suggests potential interactions with receptors that have binding sites for such functional groups.
Step 2: The nitro group could be a key feature, as it is often involved in binding to proteins and enzymes, particularly those that contain heme or other metal-binding sites. This could suggest potential interactions with enzymes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are known to metabolize drugs containing nitro groups.
Step 3: The benzene ring with attached substituents (like the nitro group and amine) can form hydrogen bonds and π-π stacking interactions, which are common in receptor-ligand interactions. This structural feature might lead to interactions with receptors such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are dopamine receptors, as they often bind molecules with aromatic rings.
Step 4: Given the presence of a nitro group and the overall structure, this molecule could also interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, specifically CYP3A4, due to its role in metabolizing drugs with similar structures.
Step 5: Based on the structure and functional groups present, the molecule is likely to interact with the following genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4. These genes encode enzymes and receptors that could potentially bind or metabolize the molecule. 
Summary of Related Genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
