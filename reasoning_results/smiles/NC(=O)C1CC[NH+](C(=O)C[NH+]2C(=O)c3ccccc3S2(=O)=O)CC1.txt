Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NC(=O)C1CC[NH+](C(=O)C[NH+]2C(=O)c3ccccc3S2(=O)=O)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a structure that includes a pyrrole ring, an amide group (-CONH), and a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH). These structural features suggest potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of amide and sulfonamide groups indicates that this molecule could be an inhibitor or substrate for CYP enzymes, particularly CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize drugs containing these functional groups.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which may interact with receptors such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This feature could make the molecule relevant to genes encoding GPCRs, including HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A) and HTR2B (serotonin receptor 2B).
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule also suggests it might have affinity for other receptors like adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 5: Given the above analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4.
