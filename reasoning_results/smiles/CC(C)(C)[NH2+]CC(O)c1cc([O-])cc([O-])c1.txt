Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)(C)[NH2+]CC(O)c1cc([O-])cc([O-])c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings and functional groups including an amine group (-NH2), an ester group (C=O), and negatively charged oxygens (O-). The presence of the amine group suggests potential for interaction with proteins that have binding sites for basic molecules.
Step 2: The molecular structure includes a benzene ring with a substituted nitrogen (N+), which could indicate the molecule may interact with proteins containing positively charged binding sites, such as ion channels or receptors that bind basic ligands.
Step 3: The negatively charged oxygens (O-) suggest the molecule could interact with proteins involved in ion transport or signaling pathways where negatively charged moieties are important, like G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) or voltage-gated ion channels.
Step 4: Considering the structure's complexity and the presence of specific functional groups, this molecule might be related to genes encoding proteins that modulate neurotransmission, ion channel activity, or drug metabolism. This aligns with the presence of negatively charged oxygens and an amine group.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is most likely related to genes involved in neurotransmitter signaling and ion channel function. The related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CACNA1H, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, and SIGMAR1.
