Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Nc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)[NH+]2CCc3ccccc3C2)cc1)C1CCCO1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitroimidazole ring system, which is a common pharmacophore for drugs targeting various receptors and enzymes. This structural feature is relevant to several genes involved in receptor signaling and enzyme function.
Step 2: The presence of a quinolone-like moiety in the molecule suggests potential interactions with DNA topoisomerases, particularly Topo II, which is associated with the CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 genes encoding cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a benzene ring with an amide group, which could interact with proteins such as receptors and ion channels. This structural motif is relevant to the ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4 genes encoding adrenergic and cholinergic receptors.
Step 4: The presence of a sulfonamide group indicates potential interactions with enzymes like CYP2D6, which is encoded by the CYP2D6 gene, and may also interact with other sulfonamide-sensitive enzymes.
Step 5: The overall structure suggests potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are associated with the HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 genes encoding serotonin receptors, among others.
Summary of related genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
