Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(N=c1[n-]c(-c2ccccn2)cs1)C1COc2ccccc2O1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom in a cyclic structure (N=c1[n-]c), which suggests it may interact with receptors that have binding sites for nitrogen-containing compounds, such as some G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 2: The molecule also includes a benzene ring (c2ccccn2) and a cyano group (-c), which are common features in molecules that can modulate enzyme activity, particularly those involved in drug metabolism like CYP enzymes.
Step 3: The presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group (O1) and an ester linkage (C1CO) indicate the molecule could potentially interact with enzymes that metabolize drugs, such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19.
Step 4: Given the structural features mentioned, the molecule might interact with genes encoding enzymes involved in drug metabolism and transport, such as CYP2D6, CYP3A4, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4.
Step 5: Additionally, due to the presence of a cyclic structure and nitrogen, the molecule could also interact with receptors that bind nitrogen-containing ligands, such as HTR2A and HTR2B, which encode serotonin receptors.
