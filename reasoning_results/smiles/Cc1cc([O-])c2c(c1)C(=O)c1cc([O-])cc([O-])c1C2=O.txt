Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc([O-])c2c(c1)C(=O)c1cc([O-])cc([O-])c1C2=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a molecule that contains multiple functional groups including an amide (C(=O)-), carboxyl (-COOH), and two ester (-O-) functionalities. This suggests the molecule could be involved in interactions with enzymes or receptors that recognize such functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) indicates this molecule might be able to act as a ligand or substrate for enzymes involved in metabolism or signaling pathways, such as those encoded by genes like CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize drugs and other small molecules.
Step 3: The ester groups (-O-) in the molecule may also interact with enzymes that recognize or cleave esters, such as those encoded by CYP2C19, which is involved in the metabolism of various substrates.
Step 4: Given the presence of an amide group (C(=O)-N) and carboxylic acid group, the molecule could potentially interact with receptors or ion channels that have binding sites for these functional groups. For example, it might interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A) and HTR2B (serotonin receptor 2B), both of which are encoded by genes mentioned in the list.
Step 5: Considering the above structural features, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, CYP2D6) and neurotransmitter signaling (HTR2A, HTR2B). Other potential genes include those encoding for receptors and enzymes that interact with carboxylic acids and esters, such as CYP1A2 and CYP2C19.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP1A2
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
These genes are primarily involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmitter signaling.
