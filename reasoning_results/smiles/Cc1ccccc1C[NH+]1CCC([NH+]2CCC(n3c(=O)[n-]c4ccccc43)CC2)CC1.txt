Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccccc1C[NH+]1CCC([NH+]2CCC(n3c(=O)[n-]c4ccccc43)CC2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with multiple substituents, including an amide group and a quaternary ammonium group. These structural features suggest that the molecule could interact with proteins involved in neurotransmission or receptor modulation.
Step 2: The presence of a quaternary ammonium group (N+), which is positively charged, indicates that this molecule may be able to bind to ion channels or receptors that have negatively charged binding sites, such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: Several of the listed genes encode for GPCRs, including DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are known to be involved in regulating neurotransmitter signaling and are often targeted by drugs due to their roles in mood regulation and other neurological functions.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule’s aromatic structure and amide functionality might also interact with enzymes like CYP2D6, which is involved in the metabolism of many drugs, suggesting potential pharmacokinetic interactions.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure, it is likely to interact with several of the listed genes, particularly those encoding GPCRs (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) and CYP2D6.
