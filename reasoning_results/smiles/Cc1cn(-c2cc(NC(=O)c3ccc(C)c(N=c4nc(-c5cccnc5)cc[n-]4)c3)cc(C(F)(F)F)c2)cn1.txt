Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cn(-c2cc(NC(=O)c3ccc(C)c(N=c4nc(-c5cccnc5)cc[n-]4)c3)cc(C(F)(F)F)c2)cn1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that contains several functional groups such as amides, aromatic rings, and heterocycles. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in neurotransmitter systems and signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-CONH-) indicates that the molecule could interact with enzymes or receptors that have amine binding sites, which are common in neurotransmitter receptors and transporters.
Step 3: The aromatic rings, particularly the benzene ring with a nitrogen atom (indicated by the 'n' in the SMILES), suggest that the molecule may have electrophilic or nucleophilic reactivity, potentially influencing enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: Given the presence of multiple functional groups and the overall complexity, this molecule might interact with various receptors and ion channels, including those associated with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ligand-gated ion channels, such as DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, and LCK, which are involved in neuronal signaling and neurotransmission.
Step 5: Considering the potential for metabolic interactions and receptor binding, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, and LCK.
