Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCNC(=O)Nc1ccc(Oc2ncnc3cc(OC)c(OC)cc23)cc1Cl, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a chemical compound that contains a benzene ring, an amide group (-CONH-), and multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups. The presence of these functional groups suggests the molecule may have pharmacological activity, potentially interacting with proteins involved in signal transduction, neurotransmission, or other cellular processes.
Step 2: Notably, the molecule has a structure that includes a benzene ring attached to an amide group and several hydroxyl groups, which are common features in many ligands for receptors such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are known to be regulated by various signaling pathways and are often targeted by drugs due to their role in transmitting signals from the cell surface to the interior.
Step 3: Given the molecular structure, it is plausible that this compound could interact with GPCRs, particularly those involved in neurotransmission and signaling. Specific examples include HTR1A (5-HT1A receptor), HTR2A (serotonin 5-HT2A receptor), HTR2B (serotonin 5-HT2B receptor), and HTR2C (serotonin 5-HT2C receptor), which are all GPCRs that play crucial roles in modulating mood, behavior, and cognition.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of hydroxyl groups and the overall structure of the molecule might also suggest potential interactions with enzymes like CYP2D6 and CYP2C9, which are involved in the metabolism of various drugs and xenobiotics. These enzymes are part of the cytochrome P450 family and are important for drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related genes to this molecule are likely to be involved in neurotransmission, signal transduction, and drug metabolism. The list of related genes includes: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CYP2D6, and CYP2C9.
