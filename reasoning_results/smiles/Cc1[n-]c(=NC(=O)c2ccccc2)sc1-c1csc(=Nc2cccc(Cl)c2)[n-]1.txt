Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1[n-]c(=NC(=O)c2ccccc2)sc1-c1csc(=Nc2cccc(Cl)c2)[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a negative charge, indicated by [n-], which is part of a heterocyclic ring system. This feature suggests potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for negatively charged molecules or ions.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a nitro group (-NO2), which could interact with enzymes involved in metabolic pathways, such as those encoded by genes related to cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of aromatic rings and a benzene ring indicates possible binding to receptors or transporters that recognize aromatic compounds, potentially linking to genes like DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), DRD3 (Dopamine receptor D3), and DRD4 (Dopamine receptor D4).
Step 4: The molecule's overall structure may allow it to bind to ion channels, given its heterocyclic nature and the presence of functional groups that could interact with ion channel proteins, such as KCNH2 (Voltage-gated potassium channel subfamily H member 2).
Step 5: Considering the above structural features, the molecule is most likely related to the following genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, KCNH2.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, KCNH2.
