Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc2cc(C(=O)Nc3ccc(F)cc3)sc(=O)c2c1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples or additional text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is often involved in drug metabolism pathways. This suggests potential interactions with enzymes that metabolize drugs, such as CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Step 2: The molecule also includes a carboxamide group (-CONH2), which can form hydrogen bonds and is common in ligands for receptors like GPCRs. This indicates possible interactions with receptors such as DRD2 (Dopamine D2 receptor), HTR2A (Serotonin 5-HT2A receptor), and HRH1 (Histamine H1 receptor).
Step 3: The presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) might suggest activity related to enzymes that metabolize phenols, potentially linking to genes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19.
Step 4: The molecule has a thiazole ring, which is known to interact with certain nuclear receptors and kinases. This could imply a relationship with genes such as PPARG (Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) and LCK (Lck tyrosine kinase).
Step 5: The overall structure, including the presence of a carboxylic acid ester, aromatic rings, and heterocycles, is characteristic of molecules that may modulate ion channels and transporters. This could be relevant to genes such as KCNH2 (Potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2) and SLC6A4 (Solute carrier family 6 member 4).
Summary of related gene names: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, HRH1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, PPARG, LCK, KCNH2, SLC6A4.
