Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1[n-]ccc2nc(-c3ccc(C[NH+]4CCC(c5n[n-]c(-c6ccccn6)n5)CC4)cc3)c(-c3ccccc3)cc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups, including a nitrile group (-CN), amide groups (-CONH-), and aromatic rings. It also contains heteroatoms such as nitrogen and sulfur, which are common in ligands that interact with receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: Analyzing the structure for potential interactions with specific genes, we focus on those involved in neurotransmitter systems, as the presence of amide and aromatic groups suggests possible binding to receptors. Genes like DRD2 (Dopamine Receptor D2), HTR1A (Serotonin Receptor 1A), and HTR2A (Serotonin Receptor 2A) are related to neurotransmitter signaling and could be influenced by molecules with similar structures.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a nitrile group could suggest potential interactions with enzymes such as CYP2D6, which is involved in the metabolism of various drugs and neurotransmitters. The overall complexity of the molecule also indicates it might interact with more than one receptor or enzyme, making it relevant to multiple genes involved in different pathways.
Step 4: Considering the pharmacological profile of the molecule, it may influence neurotransmission and drug metabolism, which are functions associated with genes like CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR1A, and HTR2A. These genes play key roles in the central nervous system and are known to be affected by compounds with similar structural features.
Step 5: Based on the analysis of the molecule’s structure and its potential interactions with various genes, the most likely related genes are DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, and CYP2D6. These genes are involved in dopamine and serotonin signaling as well as drug metabolism, aligning with the structural features of the given molecule.
