Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc2c(c1)CCc1sc(=NC(=O)c3ccc(C)cc3)[n-]c1-2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring system, which is a common feature in many ligands that interact with receptors such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural element may suggest potential interaction with genes encoding GPCRs.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a quinoline ring, which is known to be involved in binding to various enzymes and receptors. This could indicate a relationship with genes encoding proteins that have quinoline-binding sites.
Step 3: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH2) suggests potential interactions with proteins that require protonation or deprotonation for activity, possibly linking the molecule to genes encoding ion channels or transporters.
Step 4: The overall structure and functional groups of the molecule hint at possible interactions with genes encoding enzymes like CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 due to their role in metabolizing drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 5: Based on the structural features identified, the molecule is most likely related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and PTGS1. These genes encode proteins that may directly or indirectly interact with the molecule's chemical structure. To summarize, the related genes are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, PTGS1.
