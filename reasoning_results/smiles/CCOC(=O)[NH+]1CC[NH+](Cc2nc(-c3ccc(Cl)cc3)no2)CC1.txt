Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)[NH+]1CC[NH+](Cc2nc(-c3ccc(Cl)cc3)no2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other type of explanation.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with a carboxamide group and a positively charged amine, suggesting it may interact with receptors that have similar chemical moieties.
Step 2: The presence of a quinoline ring and a substituted phenyl group indicates potential interaction with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The positively charged nitrogen in the molecule could form hydrogen bonds with acidic residues in receptor binding sites, particularly those of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 4: Given the pattern of substituents and functional groups, the molecule might interact with enzymes such as CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, which are involved in Phase I drug metabolism.
Step 5: The molecule's structure may also suggest interactions with receptors like DRD2, HTR2A, and HTR2B, which are known to bind small molecules with similar chemical features.
