Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: c1ccc(CC2=[NH+]CCN2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string c1ccc(CC2=[NH+]CCN2)cc1 contains a nitrogen atom that is part of an amide group (-CONH-). This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins that have amine binding sites.
Step 2: The presence of a positively charged nitrogen (NH+) indicates that the molecule could interact with proteins containing negatively charged sites, such as carboxyl groups, which are common in receptors and transporters.
Step 3: Considering the molecular structure, it resembles some known ligands for neurotransmitter receptors, particularly those involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways. This suggests possible interactions with receptors that modulate the release or uptake of neurotransmitters.
Step 4: Given the pattern and charge distribution, this molecule might interact with receptors like HTR2A (serotonin 5-HT2A receptor), HTR2B (serotonin 5-HT2B receptor), and HTR2C (serotonin 5-HT2C receptor), all of which are part of the serotonergic system.
Step 5: Based on the interaction with serotonin receptors, the related genes include: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Summary of related gene names:
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- HTR6 Step 5: Based on the interaction with serotonin receptors, the related genes include: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. Summary of related gene names:
- HTR6
This summary highlights the key genes potentially influenced by the given molecule due to its structural characteristics and likely interactions with neurotransmitter receptors.
