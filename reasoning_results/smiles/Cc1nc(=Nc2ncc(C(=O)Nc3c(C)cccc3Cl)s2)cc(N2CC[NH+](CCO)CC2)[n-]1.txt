Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1nc(=Nc2ncc(C(=O)Nc3c(C)cccc3Cl)s2)cc(N2CC[NH+](CCO)CC2)[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a quinoline ring system and a nitro group, which are characteristic features of some ABL1 inhibitors. This suggests potential interaction with ABL1.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a benzene ring with an amide group, which is a common motif in CYP2D6 substrates and inhibitors. This indicates possible involvement with CYP2D6.
Step 3: The presence of a benzene ring with an ester group could suggest activity or interaction with enzymes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are involved in the metabolism of various drugs.
Step 4: The molecule has a phenolic group, which might interact with receptors such as HTR2A (serotonin receptor), potentially affecting its function.
Step 5: The overall structure, including multiple aromatic rings and functional groups, could influence the binding to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like DRD2 (dopamine receptor).
