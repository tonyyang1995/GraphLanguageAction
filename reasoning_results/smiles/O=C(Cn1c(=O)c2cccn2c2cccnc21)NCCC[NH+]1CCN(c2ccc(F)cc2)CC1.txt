Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Cn1c(=O)c2cccn2c2cccnc21)NCCC[NH+]1CCN(c2ccc(F)cc2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple functional groups such as an amide (-CONH-), a ketone (C=O), and various aromatic rings. It also includes nitrogen-containing heterocycles, which are common in ligands that interact with receptors. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for similar functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule could indicate its potential as a ligand for receptors that bind to amino groups. Notably, several of the listed genes encode receptors that interact with such ligands, including DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which encode dopamine receptors, and HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode serotonin receptors.
Step 3: The molecule's aromatic nature and presence of functional groups like amides and ketones might also suggest it could interact with enzymes or transporters. For instance, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in drug metabolism, and SLC6A2 and SLC6A4 are sodium-dependent neurotransmitter transporters.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's overall structure could be relevant to signaling pathways mediated by receptors encoded by genes like PTGS1, which encodes cyclooxygenase-1, a key enzyme in prostaglandin synthesis, and KCNH2, which encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule may be related to the following genes: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, PTGS1, and KCNH2. These genes are involved in neurotransmission, metabolism, and cellular signaling processes that could potentially be affected by the molecule.
