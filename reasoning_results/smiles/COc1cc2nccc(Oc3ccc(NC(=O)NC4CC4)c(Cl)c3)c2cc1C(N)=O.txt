Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc2nccc(Oc3ccc(NC(=O)NC4CC4)c(Cl)c3)c2cc1C(N)=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a core structure that includes a benzene ring with a nitro group (-NO2), an amide (-CONH-), and a phenol (-OH). This pattern suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, particularly those catalyzing reactions such as oxidation and conjugation.
Step 2: The presence of a nitro group and amide could indicate potential interactions with enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize drugs containing similar functional groups. These enzymes are involved in Phase I reactions, where they oxidize substrates.
Step 3: The molecule also has a quinone-like structure (quinoline ring) and a carboxylic acid group, which might interact with enzymes such as CYP1A2 and CYP3A4, which are involved in the metabolism of various drugs including those with quinone and carboxylic acid functionalities.
Step 4: Given the molecule's complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, it may have broad metabolic effects, potentially interacting with several genes involved in drug metabolism pathways. However, the most likely candidates based on the provided structure are CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP1A2, and CYP3A4.
Step 5: The related genes to this molecule are: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP1A2, and CYP3A4. These genes encode enzymes that play key roles in the metabolism of the described molecule. 
Summary of related genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP3A4.
