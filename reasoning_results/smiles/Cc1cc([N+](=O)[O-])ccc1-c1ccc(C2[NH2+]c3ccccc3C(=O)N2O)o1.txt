Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc([N+](=O)[O-])ccc1-c1ccc(C2[NH2+]c3ccccc3C(=O)N2O)o1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound containing a core structure with a benzene ring, a nitrogen atom with an attached amide group (N+ = O), and a carboxylate group (-O). This structure is likely to be a drug-like molecule with potential interactions with proteins involved in signaling pathways.
Step 2: Analyzing the pattern of the molecule, we see it contains a carboxamide group (-CONH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which are common functional groups for ligands that can bind to receptors or enzymes. These functional groups could interact with transmembrane receptors or ion channels, which are often encoded by genes listed here.
Step 3: The presence of a nitrogen atom with an attached amide group suggests the molecule might interact with receptors that have similar binding sites, such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Among the provided genes, several are known to encode GPCRs: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 4: Additionally, the carboxylic acid group and the overall structure of the molecule indicate potential interactions with enzymes or transporters, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and SLC6A4. These genes are involved in metabolism and transport processes, respectively.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis and the potential interaction sites, the molecule is most likely related to the genes encoding GPCRs and enzymes/transporters. Therefore, the related gene names are:
- GPCRs: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- Enzymes/Transporters: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, SLC6A4
Summary of Related Genes:
- ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, SLC6A4
These genes encode proteins that could potentially interact with or be affected by the described molecule.
