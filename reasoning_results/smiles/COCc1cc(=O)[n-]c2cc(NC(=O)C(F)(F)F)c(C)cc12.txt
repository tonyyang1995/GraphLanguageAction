Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COCc1cc(=O)[n-]c2cc(NC(=O)C(F)(F)F)c(C)cc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is common in many drug molecules and can interact with various receptors and transporters.
Step 2: The presence of a pyrrolidine ring and a pyridine ring suggests potential interactions with ion channels and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The molecule has a quinoline moiety, which can be recognized by certain enzymes like CYP2D6 involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: The presence of fluorine atoms indicates possible interactions with proteins that bind small polar molecules, such as transporters.
Step 5: Given the structural features, the molecule may interact with genes encoding for receptors and transporters, including CYP2D6, HTR2A, HTR2B, and SLC6A4.
Related Genes: CYP2D6, HTR2A, HTR2B, SLC6A4 Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is common in many drug molecules and can interact with various receptors and transporters.
