Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)COCC(CN(Cc1ccccc1)c1ccccc1)[NH+]1CCCC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings and functional groups, including a benzene ring, amide, and amine functionalities. The presence of an amine group (-NH+) suggests potential interactions with receptors that have amine binding sites.
Step 2: Among the given genes, those involved in neurotransmitter receptor functions are likely to interact with this molecule due to its amine group. These include HTR1A (serotonin receptor), HTR2A (serotonin receptor), HTR2B (serotonin receptor), HTR2C (serotonin receptor), and HTR6 (serotonin receptor).
Step 3: The molecule's benzene ring and amide group might also interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism. Genes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which encode for cytochrome P450 enzymes, could be relevant here.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure could influence genes involved in G-protein coupled receptors, such as ADRA1D (adrenergic receptor) and ADRA2B (adrenergic receptor), given their common interactions with small molecules.
Step 5: The molecule may also affect genes involved in calcium channels, such as CACNA1H (calcium channel), as it contains functionality that could interact with these channels.
