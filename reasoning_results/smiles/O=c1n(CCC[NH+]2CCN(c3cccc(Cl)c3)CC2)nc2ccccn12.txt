Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1n(CCC[NH+]2CCN(c3cccc(Cl)c3)CC2)nc2ccccn12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex molecule that includes an aromatic ring system, a cyano group (-CN), and a heterocyclic nitrogen-containing moiety. This structural complexity suggests the molecule could have multiple pharmacological targets.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group and a heterocyclic nitrogen-containing moiety indicates potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism. CYP (Cytochrome P450) enzymes, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, are known to metabolize molecules containing these functional groups. These enzymes play a crucial role in the biotransformation of drugs, making them relevant to the molecule's pharmacology.
Step 3: The molecule also has a quinolone-like structure, which could interact with ion channels and receptors. For instance, the presence of a quinoline core might be relevant to the function of KCNH2, a potassium channel subunit, and may also influence G-protein coupled receptors like HTR2A, which is involved in serotonin signaling.
Step 4: The overall structure does not strongly suggest direct interactions with kinases, receptors, or other proteins listed without further context about their specific binding sites or motifs. However, given its complexity, it could potentially modulate the activity of kinases like LCK, which is involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 5: Based on the molecular features described, the most likely related genes include those involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6), ion channel modulation (KCNH2), and neurotransmitter receptor function (HTR2A).
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP1A2
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
- KCNH2
- HTR2A
These genes are the most plausible candidates for interaction with the described molecule based on its chemical structure and potential pharmacological activities. Other genes may also be relevant depending on additional experimental data.
