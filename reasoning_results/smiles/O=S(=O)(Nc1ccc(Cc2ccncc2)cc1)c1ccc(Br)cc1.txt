Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=S(=O)(Nc1ccc(Cc2ccncc2)cc1)c1ccc(Br)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that contains a sulfonyl group (SO2), a benzene ring, and a pyridine ring fused with a benzene ring. This structure suggests the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP enzymes.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of a sulfonyl group is a common feature in CYP enzyme inhibitors. CYP enzymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, are known to metabolize various drugs, and their inhibition can lead to altered pharmacokinetics and potential drug-drug interactions.
Step 3: The benzene and pyridine rings suggest the molecule may have a structure similar to known ligands for receptors or ion channels. For instance, CYP enzymes can be indirectly related to receptors through the metabolism of their ligands. Additionally, the benzene ring could interact with the hydrophobic pocket of certain receptors or ion channels.
Step 4: Considering the molecular structure, the molecule might interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or ion channels, which are involved in signal transduction pathways. GPCRs include DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4 (dopamine receptors), HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 (serotonin receptors), and CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4 (muscarinic acetylcholine receptors). Ion channels include KCNH2 (hERG potassium channel).
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and the above considerations, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and KCNH2. These genes encode proteins that are directly or indirectly involved in the interaction with the molecule described by the SMILES string.
