Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string C[NH2+]CCc1ccccn1 contains an amine group (-NH2) and a benzene ring (C6H5), which are common functional groups found in many drugs and small molecules that interact with receptors and enzymes. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins that have similar chemical properties.
Step 2: The presence of the positively charged amino group (-NH2+) indicates that the molecule could be a cationic compound, which might interact with anionic sites on protein surfaces or be recognized by ion channels and transporters. This feature may relate to the function of certain genes encoding such proteins.
Step 3: The benzene ring and the nitrogen atom attached to it can participate in hydrogen bonding and aromatic interactions, which are important for binding to proteins like receptors and enzymes. These interactions could be relevant to the function of genes involved in signal transduction and neurotransmission.
Step 4: Given the pattern of the molecule, it is likely to interact with proteins involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways, ion channel regulation, and enzyme activity. Genes encoding proteins involved in these pathways include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, KDR, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, PTGS1, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, and others that regulate these processes.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions with proteins, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, KDR, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, PTGS1, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4. These genes encode proteins that are involved in various physiological processes including neurotransmission, hormone signaling, and cellular signaling pathways.
