Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(C(=O)N=c2[n-]c3ccccc3c(=O)s2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex molecule containing a core structure with multiple functional groups, including a heterocyclic ring system and a carboxamide group. This structure is indicative of a potential ligand for receptors or enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: Upon analyzing the functional groups and the overall topology of the molecule, it appears that this compound might interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are encoded by genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These receptors are known to bind various ligands and modulate intracellular signaling cascades.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a carboxamide group suggests potential interactions with enzymes like cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms, which are encoded by genes such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These enzymes are involved in the metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics.
Step 4: The heterocyclic ring system in the molecule may also suggest potential interactions with ion channels, particularly those encoded by genes like KCNH2, which encodes the HERG potassium channel.
Step 5: Considering the detailed analysis, the related genes are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, KCNH2. These genes encode receptors and enzymes that could potentially interact with the described molecular structure.
