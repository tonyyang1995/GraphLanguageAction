Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(C(c2c([O-])ccc3ccccc23)[NH+]2CCOCC2)c(OC)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a quinoline-like structure (COc1ccc(C(c2c([O-])ccc3ccccc23)[NH+]2CCOCC2)c(OC)c1), which suggests it might interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism. This is evident from the presence of a nitrogen atom with a positive charge and a negatively charged oxygen atom, typical features of molecules that can modulate the activity of certain enzymes.
Step 2: Notably, the molecule includes a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an amide (-CONH-) moiety. These functional groups are known to be involved in interactions with receptors and enzymes such as those encoded by CYP (cytochrome P450) genes, which play crucial roles in the metabolism of many drugs.
Step 3: Given the presence of aromatic rings and potential hydrogen bonding donors/acceptors, this molecule could also interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are often associated with neurotransmitter signaling pathways and are encoded by genes like DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, and others listed.
Step 4: The overall structure indicates the molecule may have affinity for ion channels, particularly those involved in calcium regulation, such as CACNA1H, which encodes a voltage-gated calcium channel.
Step 5: Considering the diverse pharmacophoric elements present, the molecule likely interacts with multiple genes, including but not limited to CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, CACNA1H, and others involved in drug metabolism and signaling pathways.
