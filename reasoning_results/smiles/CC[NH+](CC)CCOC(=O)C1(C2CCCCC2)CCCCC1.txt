Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC[NH+](CC)CCOC(=O)C1(C2CCCCC2)CCCCC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule containing multiple functional groups such as amine (NH+), alkyl chains (CC), hydroxyl (OC), and carboxylic acid (C(=O)). The presence of an amine group suggests that this molecule could act as a ligand or substrate for enzymes or receptors that interact with amines.
Step 2: The alkyl chains and the overall molecular structure are similar to those found in several neurotransmitters and drugs that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Specifically, the molecule's structure could potentially interact with receptors that have similar binding sites, such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4).
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a carboxylic acid group (C(=O)) suggests that this molecule might be able to form hydrogen bonds or other interactions with proteins that contain charged residues, such as ion channels (CACNA1H, KCNH2) or enzymes like cytochrome P450 (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Step 4: The overall structure also indicates that the molecule could potentially inhibit or activate certain kinases, such as CDK2 or LCK, which are involved in cell cycle regulation and signaling pathways.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions with various protein classes, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CACNA1H, KCNH2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CDK2, and LCK. These genes encode proteins that may directly or indirectly interact with the described molecule.
