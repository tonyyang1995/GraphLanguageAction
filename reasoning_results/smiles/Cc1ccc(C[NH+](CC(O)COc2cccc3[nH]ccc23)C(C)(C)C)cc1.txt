Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(C[NH+](CC(O)COc2cccc3[nH]ccc23)C(C)(C)C)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with multiple functional groups including amine (NH2), amide (CONH), ester (COO), and aromatic rings. This indicates the molecule likely interacts with proteins that have binding sites for these functional groups.
Step 2: Analyzing the molecular structure, there are several potential interactions that could be relevant to certain genes. Notably, the presence of an amine group (-NH+) and a quaternary ammonium salt could suggest the molecule might interact with receptors that bind to amines or positively charged molecules. Additionally, the presence of aromatic rings suggests possible interactions with proteins containing hydrophobic binding sites.
Step 3: Considering the genes listed, those involved in neurotransmitter transport and receptor function, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode serotonin receptors, are particularly relevant due to their binding affinity for amine compounds. Also, genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), like CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4, which bind to acetylcholine, might also be relevant given the amine functionality.
Step 4: The molecule's ability to form hydrogen bonds, due to the presence of -OH and -NH groups, could also be significant for interactions with enzymes and receptors that require hydrogen bonding for proper function. Genes such as CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which encode cytochrome P450 enzymes, might be influenced by this property.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes include: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These genes are primarily involved in neurotransmitter signaling and metabolism.
