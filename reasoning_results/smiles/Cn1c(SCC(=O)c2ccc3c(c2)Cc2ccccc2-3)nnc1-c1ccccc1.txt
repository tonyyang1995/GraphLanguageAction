Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cn1c(SCC(=O)c2ccc3c(c2)Cc2ccccc2-3)nnc1-c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a complex structure with multiple rings, including benzene, pyrrole, and possibly other heterocycles. This complexity suggests potential interactions with proteins that have similar structural motifs, such as receptors and transporters.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH-) and a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) could indicate the molecule may interact with enzymes involved in metabolism or signaling pathways, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 3: The molecule's aromatic nature and potential for hydrogen bonding might suggest it could bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are often involved in neurotransmission and signaling. Genes like HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C encode such receptors.
Step 4: The overall size and shape of the molecule, along with its functional groups, could allow it to interact with kinases or other proteins involved in signal transduction, such as those encoded by CDK2 and LCK.
Step 5: Given the molecule's potential for interaction with metabolic enzymes and receptors, the related genes include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CDK2, and LCK. Step 5: Summary of related gene names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CDK2, LCK.
