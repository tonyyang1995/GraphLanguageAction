Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCc1nc2c(C)cc(N3CC[NH+](CC(=O)[NH+]4CC(O)C4)CC3)cn2c1N(C)c1nc(-c2ccc(F)cc2)c(C#N)s1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with multiple substituents, including an amide group, a ketone group, and fluorine atoms. These structural features suggest potential interactions with enzymes and receptors involved in signal transduction and neurotransmission.
Step 2: The presence of a ketone group and amide functionalities indicates the molecule could be a substrate for CYP2D6, which metabolizes a wide range of drugs, including those containing these functional groups.
Step 3: The molecule's structure also suggests it might interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), given the presence of a benzene ring and substituents that could form hydrogen bonds. GPCRs are associated with several genes listed, such as DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, and HTR2B.
Step 4: The molecule's aromatic nature and potential for forming hydrogen bonds also points towards possible interactions with ion channels, such as KCNH2, which is encoded by the KCNQ2 gene.
Step 5: Given the molecule's complexity and potential to interact with both metabolic enzymes and receptors, it is likely to have relationships with multiple genes, including CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and KCNQ2.
