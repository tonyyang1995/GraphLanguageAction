Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1c(C(=O)[NH+]2CCCCCC2)nnn1-c1no[n-]c1=N, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring system and an amide group, which are common in ligands that interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This suggests potential interaction with genes encoding for GPCRs.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a quinoline ring, which is characteristic of many drugs that act as inhibitors or agonists of various receptors, including those encoded by genes such as HTR1A, HTR2A, and HTR2C, which encode serotonin receptors.
Step 3: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) in the molecule could indicate a potential interaction with genes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19.
Step 4: The overall structure and functional groups suggest possible interactions with genes like DRD2 and DRD3, which encode dopamine receptors, given their ability to bind to similar ligands.
Step 5: Based on the molecular features, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4. Step 5: Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
