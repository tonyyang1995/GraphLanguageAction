Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1[n-]c(=O)[n-]c1C(=O)CCCCC(=O)[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with multiple nitrogen-containing rings and carboxylate groups, suggesting it may interact with proteins involved in neurotransmission or metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of aromatic rings and carboxylate groups indicates potential interactions with enzymes or receptors that have similar functional groups.
Step 3: The pattern of nitrogen atoms with negative charges suggests the molecule could be an agonist or antagonist for ion channels or receptors containing basic residues, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 4: Given the structure includes multiple carboxylic acid groups, it might interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, like those encoded by CYP genes.
Step 5: Based on the molecule’s structure, it is likely to interact with genes encoding for neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, and SIGMAR1.
