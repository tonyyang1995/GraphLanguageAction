Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(CC[NH3+])cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule in question is a N-oxide of a benzene ring with a sulfonyl group attached, and it contains an amine group that can form hydrogen bonds. This structure suggests potential interactions with receptors and transporters that have similar functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of an amine group (NH3+) in the molecule could indicate its ability to bind to ion channels, receptors, or transport proteins that have complementary functional groups. For instance, this could potentially interact with adrenergic receptors such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, and ADRB2, which are involved in signaling pathways mediated by catecholamines and other agonists.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule’s sulfonyl group could interact with cysteine residues in proteins, which might be relevant for proteins like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are enzymes involved in drug metabolism. These enzymes catalyze the oxidation of various substrates, including many drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 4: Furthermore, the molecule may also interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to its amine and sulfonyl functionalities, such as HTR2A and HTR2B, which are involved in serotonin signaling, or HRH1, which is involved in histamine signaling.
Step 5: Based on the structural features of the molecule, it is likely to be related to several genes involved in neurotransmitter systems, drug metabolism, and receptor signaling, including: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HRH1. Step 5: Summary of related gene names:
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- ADRB2
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HRH1
