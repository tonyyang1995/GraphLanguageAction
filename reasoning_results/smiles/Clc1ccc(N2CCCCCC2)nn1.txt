Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Clc1ccc(N2CCCCCC2)nn1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples or additional unnecessary text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom within a ring structure, which is part of a larger aromatic system. This pattern is consistent with known ligands that interact with certain receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule suggests potential interactions with proteins containing histidine or tyrosine residues, which are common in G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The molecule's overall structure includes multiple aromatic rings, which could be recognized by enzymes involved in drug metabolism such as CYP enzymes.
Step 4: Given the molecular structure, it may interact with receptors or enzymes associated with neurotransmitter systems, such as those involved in dopamine signaling (e.g., DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) or serotonin signaling (e.g., HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Step 5: Considering the molecule's structure and potential interaction points, the related genes include: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6. Step 5: Summary of related gene names: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
