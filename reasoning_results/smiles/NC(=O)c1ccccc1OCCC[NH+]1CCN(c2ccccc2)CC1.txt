Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring (NC(=O)c1ccccc1), an aromatic ring (OCCC), and a benzene ring (N[NH+]1CCN(c2ccccc2)CC1). These structural elements are characteristic of molecules that can interact with certain receptors or enzymes involved in signal transduction and drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and amide group (NC(=O)) suggests the molecule could potentially act as an agonist or antagonist for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are encoded by genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These receptors play crucial roles in neurotransmission and are involved in various physiological processes.
Step 3: The aromatic ring and the amide functionality also indicate the potential for the molecule to be a substrate for cytochrome P450 enzymes, specifically CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These enzymes are responsible for the metabolism of numerous drugs and xenobiotics, making them relevant to the pharmacological activity of the molecule.
Step 4: Considering the overall structure, the molecule might have affinity for the estrogen receptor (ESR1), given its potential to bind to DNA and other ligand-binding domains, similar to other known estrogen receptor modulators.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the related genes for this molecule include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, ESR1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
