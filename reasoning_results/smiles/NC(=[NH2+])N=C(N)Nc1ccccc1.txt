Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NC(=[NH2+])N=C(N)Nc1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule has a complex structure featuring a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (indicated by the 'N' atoms), which often plays a significant role in binding to receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways. This pattern suggests potential interaction with genes encoding receptors and enzymes that are involved in these processes.
Step 2: The molecule contains a nitrile group (NC) and an amide group (N=), which are functional groups known to interact with various proteins, including ion channels and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). These interactions can influence the activity of genes encoding such proteins.
Step 3: Given the presence of amino groups (NH2+) and the overall structure, this molecule could potentially act as a ligand for receptors like adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), which are known to be influenced by molecules containing similar functional groups.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure may also interact with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize many drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the most likely related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. These genes encode receptors and enzymes that could potentially interact with the described molecular structure. 
Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
