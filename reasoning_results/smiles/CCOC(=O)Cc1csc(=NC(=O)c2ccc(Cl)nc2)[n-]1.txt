Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)Cc1csc(=NC(=O)c2ccc(Cl)nc2)[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a phenolic group (phenol) and an amide group, which are common in drugs that interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This suggests potential interaction with genes encoding such receptors.
Step 2: The molecule also has a quinoline ring, which is characteristic of some CYP enzyme substrates and inhibitors. This indicates possible metabolism or regulation by enzymes encoded by CYP genes.
Step 3: The presence of a benzene ring with an amide and a carboxylic acid group could suggest activity as an antagonist or agonist for receptors involved in signaling pathways, potentially interacting with genes like DRD2, HTR2A, and HTR2B.
Step 4: The molecule's structure includes a pyridine ring, which may be relevant to its interactions with certain kinases or enzymes, possibly involving genes like LCK.
Step 5: Given the structural features, the molecule is likely to interact with multiple genes including ABCB1, ABL1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KDR, LCK, OPRK1, PTGS1, and SIGMAR1.
