Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc2c(=NC3CC[NH+](C(C)C)CC3)[n-]c(N3CCC(F)(F)CC3)nc2cc1OCCC[NH+]1CCCC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule contains multiple functional groups such as an amide (N-C), a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH), and fluorine atoms (-F). These features suggest that the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group and the overall structure of the molecule resemble those found in known ligands for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This suggests that the molecule might interact with GPCRs, which are encoded by several of the listed genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule includes a cytochrome P450 enzyme interaction motif, specifically the presence of fluorine atoms, which are often involved in CYP2D6 substrates or inhibitors. This indicates potential interactions with CYP2D6, a gene encoding a drug-metabolizing enzyme.
Step 4: The molecule also has a structure that could potentially inhibit or activate certain ion channels, given its overall architecture and the presence of functional groups like amides. This suggests possible interactions with KCNH2, which encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel.
Step 5: Based on the above structural analysis, the molecule appears to be most closely related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, and CYP2D6.
