Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)Oc1ccc2c(=O)c(-c3ccccc3)coc2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring, an amide group, and a hydroxyl group. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes and receptors that are involved in metabolism and signaling pathways.
Step 2: The presence of the amide group (N-C=O) indicates the molecule could be an inhibitor or substrate for enzymes such as cytochrome P450s (CYP enzymes), which are involved in drug metabolism and are listed among the provided genes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Step 3: The hydroxyl group (-OH) can participate in hydrogen bonding, which may allow the molecule to interact with receptors that have binding sites for hydroxyl-containing molecules, such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 4: Given the complexity of the molecule and its functional groups, it might also influence signaling pathways involving G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are implicated in neurotransmission and are listed among the provided genes.
Step 5: The molecule's structure does not directly suggest significant interactions with genes related to other processes such as angiogenesis (e.g., VEGF receptors), hormone receptors (e.g., ESR1, HRH1), or cell proliferation (e.g., CDK2, MCL1).
Summary of Related Genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring, an amide group, and a hydroxyl group. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes and receptors that are involved in metabolism and signaling pathways.
