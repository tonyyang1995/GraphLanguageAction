Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccccc1OCC(=O)Nc1sc(C(=O)Nc2cccc(C)c2C)c(C)c1C#N, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple functional groups such as aromatic rings (indicated by benzene rings), an amide group (-CONH-), an alcohol group (-OH), a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and a nitrile group (-CN). These functional groups suggest that the molecule could potentially interact with proteins involved in various biological processes.
Step 2: Analyzing the pattern of the molecule, it includes a benzene ring with attached substituents like methyl groups and other functional groups. This structure might be recognized by enzymes or receptors that are sensitive to aromatic compounds or specific functional groups.
Step 3: Considering the presence of an amide and carboxylic acid group, the molecule likely has acidic and basic properties which can influence its interaction with proteins such as ion channels or receptors that have binding sites for acidic or basic ligands.
Step 4: Given the complexity and the presence of a nitrile group, this molecule may have the potential to interact with enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYPs), which metabolize a wide range of substrates including drugs and xenobiotics. Specific CYPs like CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are known to metabolize drugs with similar structural features.
Step 5: The molecule’s structure could also influence its interaction with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), given the presence of a benzene ring and a carboxylic acid group. GPCRs like HTR1A (serotonin receptor), HTR2A (serotonin receptor), and HRH1 (histamine receptor) might be potential targets due to their ability to bind to small molecules with specific functional groups.
