Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Fc1ccccc1CSc1ncnc2c1oc1ccccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule described by the SMILES string Fc1ccccc1CSc1ncnc2c1oc1ccccc12 is a complex aromatic compound. It contains a fused ring system with benzene rings and a heteroatom (sulfur) incorporated within it. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins that bind or metabolize similar chemical moieties.
Step 2: The presence of multiple aromatic rings and the sulfur atom could indicate this molecule might interact with enzymes involved in phase I metabolism such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, which are known to oxidize various substrates including aromatic compounds. CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 are particularly relevant given their role in metabolizing drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule’s structure might allow for binding to receptors or ion channels due to its size and hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance. For instance, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like DRD2, DRD3, and HTR2A have been shown to interact with various ligands, and the molecule’s aromatic nature could potentially fit into the binding pockets of these receptors.
Step 4: The molecule’s ability to modulate receptor activity could also relate to genes encoding for enzymes that regulate second messengers or signaling pathways, such as PTGS1, which encodes cyclooxygenase-1, an enzyme involved in prostaglandin synthesis, a key component in inflammatory responses.
Step 5: Given the complexity and potential for diverse interactions, the molecule could be related to several genes including CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, HTR2A, PTGS1, and possibly others depending on further structural analysis and biological testing.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP3A4
- DRD2
- DRD3
- HTR2A
- PTGS1 Step 5: Given the molecule’s structure and potential interactions, it is likely to be related to the listed genes, particularly those involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4), neurotransmitter signaling (DRD2, DRD3, HTR2A), and inflammation (PTGS1). Further research would be needed to confirm these relationships through experimental validation. 
- PTGS1
This summary provides a concise list of genes potentially related to the molecule based on its structure and known biological functions. Additional testing would be necessary to validate these relationships.
