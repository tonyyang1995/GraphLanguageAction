Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Nc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl)c1snnc1-c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that includes several functional groups such as a nitrile group (-N#C), amide group (-CONH-), and aromatic rings (c1cccc). These structural features suggest the molecule may interact with proteins involved in signal transduction, receptor binding, or metabolic pathways.
Step 2: Considering the presence of an aromatic ring system and the nitrile group, this molecule likely has the potential to act as a ligand for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or other protein targets. This is because aromatic rings are common in ligands that bind to GPCRs, and nitriles can form hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues.
Step 3: Among the provided genes, several encode GPCRs, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes encode various subtypes of adrenergic and cholinergic receptors, as well as serotonin receptors. Given the molecular structure's potential to bind to GPCRs, it is plausible that this molecule could interact with one or more of these receptors.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of an amide group and the overall structure of the molecule might suggest interactions with enzymes or transporters. Genes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which encode cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in drug metabolism, could be relevant. Furthermore, SLC6A4, which encodes a neurotransmitter transporter, could also be a potential target due to its involvement in the reuptake of various neurotransmitters.
Step 5: Based on the analysis, the molecule appears to have the potential to interact with multiple genes, but the primary focus seems to be on GPCRs (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) and enzymes involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and neurotransmitter transport (SLC6A4).
Summary of related gene names:
- GPCRs: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- Enzymes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4
- Transporter: SLC6A4
