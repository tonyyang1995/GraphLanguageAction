Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCc1ccc(OCc2ccccc2C(=O)Nc2ccc3[n-]c(C)cc(=N)c3c2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a benzene ring with multiple functional groups including an amide (C(=O)N), an alcohol (OC), and a substituted nitrogen atom (Nc2ccc3[n-]c(C)cc(=N)c3c2). This structure suggests the molecule may interact with receptors or enzymes that have similar functional groups or binding sites.
Step 2: The presence of the amide group (C(=O)N) is characteristic of many drugs that act as agonists or antagonists for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as adrenergic (adrenoceptors) and dopaminergic receptors. This indicates potential interactions with adrenergic and dopaminergic systems.
Step 3: The nitrogen atom with negative charge ([n-]) and the substituted amine (c(C)cc(=N)c3c2) suggest the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of ion channels or transporters. This aligns with the involvement of the CACNA1H (calcium channel subunit alpha 1H) and SLC6A4 (solute carrier family 6 member 4) genes, which encode calcium channels and a dopamine transporter, respectively.
Step 4: The presence of a benzene ring with multiple substituents (OC, C(=O)N, [n-]) indicates the molecule could be metabolized by enzymes involved in phase I and II metabolism, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). This suggests potential interactions with genes encoding these enzymes.
Step 5: The overall structure of the molecule, with its amide, alcohol, and substituted nitrogen functionalities, is consistent with compounds that may interact with neurotransmitter receptors or ion channels, which are encoded by genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
