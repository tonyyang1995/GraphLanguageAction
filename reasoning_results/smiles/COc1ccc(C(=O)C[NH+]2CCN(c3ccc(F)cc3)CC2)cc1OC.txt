Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(C(=O)C[NH+]2CCN(c3ccc(F)cc3)CC2)cc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that includes a benzene ring system, a pyrrole ring, an oxazole ring, and several substituents such as methyl groups, phenyl rings, and fluorine atoms. This structure suggests the molecule could interact with proteins involved in various cellular processes.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and functional groups like amide and carboxylic acid might indicate potential interactions with enzymes or receptors that have similar functional groups. For instance, the carboxamide group could suggest a possible interaction with enzymes containing amide binding sites, which are often found in cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP family).
Step 3: The presence of a quinoline-like structure with a nitrogen atom in the ring, along with other aromatic and heteroaromatic rings, could indicate potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs often bind small molecules that fit into their binding pockets, and the given molecule’s structure might fit into some of these pockets.
Step 4: Considering the possible interactions with CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), the molecule could influence drug metabolism pathways, potentially affecting genes involved in these pathways. Additionally, the presence of a benzene ring and a carboxamide group might suggest interactions with kinases, which could be relevant to genes like CDK2.
Step 5: Given the potential for interactions with GPCRs, the molecule might also interact with genes related to neurotransmitter receptors and signaling pathways, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode serotonin receptors, and DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which encode dopamine receptors.
Summary of related gene names: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CDK2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
