Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NC(=O)C1([NH+]2CCCCC2)CC[NH+](C(=O)c2ccc(-n3cnnn3)cc2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a central amide (NC(=O)) and is connected to two aromatic rings, which are characteristic of many drug-like molecules. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for small molecules.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group and the aromatic ring systems could potentially interact with receptors that have hydrophobic binding pockets, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Specific examples include DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), HTR1A (Serotonin receptor 1A), and CHRM1 (Cholinergic receptor muscarinic M1).
Step 3: The molecule also contains a quinoline-like structure (c2ccc(-n3cnnn3)cc2), which is known to bind to certain enzymes and receptors. This pattern might interact with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are part of the cytochrome P450 family.
Step 4: The overall complexity and size of the molecule suggest it may have multiple binding sites, which could interact with several different types of proteins. However, based on the specific features identified, the most likely interactions would be with GPCRs and enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and the potential interactions described, the related genes include: DRD2, HTR1A, CHRM1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4.
