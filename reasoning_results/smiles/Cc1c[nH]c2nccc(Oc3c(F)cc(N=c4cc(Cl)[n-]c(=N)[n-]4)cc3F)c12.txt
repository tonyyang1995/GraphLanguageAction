Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1c[nH]c2nccc(Oc3c(F)cc(N=c4cc(Cl)[n-]c(=N)[n-]4)cc3F)c12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a tricyclic structure with a nitrogen atom in the ring, indicating potential for interaction with receptors that have similar structural features, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This suggests possible interactions with genes encoding GPCRs.
Step 2: The molecule also includes an aromatic ring system and a hydroxyl group, which could interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP enzymes. This points towards potential relationships with genes like CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4.
Step 3: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) and fluorine atoms in the molecule may indicate potential interactions with enzymes or receptors involved in inflammation or stress responses, suggesting possible connections with genes such as PTGS1 and HRH1.
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule, with its multiple functional groups and rings, might allow it to bind to ion channels or transporters, which are encoded by genes like KCNH2 and SLC6A4.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structural features, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, PTGS1, HRH1, KCNH2, and SLC6A4. 
Summary: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, PTGS1, HRH1, KCNH2, SLC6A4 Step 5: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, PTGS1, HRH1, KCNH2, SLC6A4
