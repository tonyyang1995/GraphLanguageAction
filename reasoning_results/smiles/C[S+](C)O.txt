Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string C[S+](C)O is an alkyl sulfonate ester. This structure suggests it may interact with enzymes that metabolize sulfur-containing compounds, such as those involved in xenobiotic metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a positively charged sulfur (S+) group could indicate the molecule is an electrophile, potentially interacting with nucleophilic sites on certain proteins. This feature is relevant for genes involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 3: Given the molecule's structure, it might be recognized by transporters or receptors that are sensitive to positively charged groups or specific functional groups like esters. Genes encoding these transporters or receptors could be relevant.
Step 4: The molecule's potential interaction with enzymes or transporters could influence neurotransmitter levels or signaling pathways. Genes like DRD2, HTR2A, and HTR2B, which encode dopamine and serotonin receptors, could be related due to their roles in neurotransmission.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule might affect enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, given its potential to be metabolized by these enzymes.
