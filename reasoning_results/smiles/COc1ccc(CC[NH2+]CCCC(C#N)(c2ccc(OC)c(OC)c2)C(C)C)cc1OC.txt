Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(CC[NH2+]CCCC(C#N)(c2ccc(OC)c(OC)c2)C(C)C)cc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a complex structure including a benzene ring system, a quinoline moiety, and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle. The presence of a quinoline moiety is notable, as it is commonly found in many drugs that interact with various receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: Among the listed genes, several are involved in the metabolism and regulation of neurotransmitters and hormones, which might be influenced by the presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocycle. For instance, CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 are known for their role in metabolizing various drugs, including those containing nitrogen heterocycles like quinolines.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a phenolic group (phenolic hydroxyl) and an amide group, both of which are functional groups that can participate in interactions with receptor proteins. DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which encode dopamine receptors, could potentially interact with this molecule due to these functional groups.
Step 4: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the quinoline ring and the amide group suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways. HTR2A and HTR2B, which encode serotonin receptors, might be relevant targets due to the presence of these functional groups.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and functional groups, the molecule is likely to have relationships with multiple genes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism and receptor signaling. Specifically, the related genes include: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR2A, and HTR2B.
