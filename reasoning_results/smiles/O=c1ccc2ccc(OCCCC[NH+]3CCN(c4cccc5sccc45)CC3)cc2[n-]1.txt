Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1ccc2ccc(OCCCC[NH+]3CCN(c4cccc5sccc45)CC3)cc2[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that includes functional groups such as amide, ester, aromatic ring, and cyclic structures. Notably, the molecule contains an aromatic ring system (cyclohexane-like) and an amide group (-CONH-). These structural elements suggest potential interactions with enzymes or receptors that have similar chemical moieties.
Step 2: Among the listed genes, those involved in drug metabolism and receptor function are most likely to interact with this molecule. Genes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 encode enzymes involved in Phase I drug metabolism, which could be relevant if the molecule is a substrate for these enzymes. Additionally, genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), like DRD2, DRD3, HTR2A, and HTR2B, might be affected due to their ability to bind small molecules.
Step 3: The presence of an amide group in the molecule suggests it could potentially act as a ligand for GPCRs, particularly those that bind to amine-containing compounds. This aligns with the function of the genes encoding dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) and serotonin receptors (HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C).
Step 4: Furthermore, the molecule's structure could also influence genes involved in signaling pathways, such as those encoding kinases (e.g., LCK, PTGS1) or other proteins involved in signal transduction, like KCNH2, which encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel.
Step 5: Based on the molecule’s structural features and potential interactions, the related genes include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, LCK, PTGS1, and KCNH2. These genes are primarily involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmitter signaling pathways.
