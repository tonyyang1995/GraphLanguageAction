Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(Nc2c(F)cccc2Cl)c(CC(=O)[O-])c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a tricyclic structure with a nitrogen atom and a carboxylate group, which suggests potential interactions with receptors that have similar chemical features.
Step 2: The presence of fluorine and chlorine atoms indicates the molecule may interact with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those coded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 3: The carboxylate group could form hydrogen bonds with proteins, particularly with receptors like DRD2, HTR1A, and HTR2A, which are known to have hydrophilic binding sites.
Step 4: The overall structure hints at potential interactions with ion channels and transporters, possibly involving genes like SLC6A2 and SLC6A4, which encode neurotransmitter transporters.
Step 5: The molecule's pattern and functional groups suggest it might interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), specifically those encoded by ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
