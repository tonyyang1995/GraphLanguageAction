Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(-c2nnn(CC(=O)N3CCCc4ccccc43)n2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a benzene ring system with multiple substituents, including a pyrrole ring, an amide group, and a quinoline-like moiety. This complex structure suggests that the molecule could be a drug or a chemical compound with potential biological activity.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (C(=O)N) indicates that the molecule might have some pharmacological activity involving protein-protein interactions or enzyme inhibition. This feature aligns with several genes listed, such as CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: The molecule's structure also includes a quinoline-like moiety, which is known to interact with various receptors and ion channels. This structural feature is relevant to genes like DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, and KCNH2, which encode for G-protein coupled receptors and voltage-gated potassium channels.
Step 4: Furthermore, the presence of a pyrrole ring and amine groups suggests the molecule may have affinity for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which are encoded by genes such as CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, KCNH2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4. These genes are involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmitter signaling, and ion channel function, making them potential targets for the molecule's biological activity.
