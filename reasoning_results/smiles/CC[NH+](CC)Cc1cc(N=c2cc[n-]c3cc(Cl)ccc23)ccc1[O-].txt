Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC[NH+](CC)Cc1cc(N=c2cc[n-]c3cc(Cl)ccc23)ccc1[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a quinolone-like structure, which is often found in drugs that interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This pattern suggests potential interactions with GPCRs, particularly those involved in neurotransmission and hormone signaling.
Step 2: The presence of a positively charged amine group (-NH+) indicates that the molecule could be an agonist or modulator of receptors with complementary binding sites, such as GPCRs. This feature points towards possible interactions with adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B), dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 3: The presence of a nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring (c1cc(N=c2cc[n-]c3cc(Cl)ccc23)) suggests the molecule may have affinity for ion channels or transporters. This feature could indicate interaction with voltage-gated sodium channels (CACNA1H) or potassium channels (KCNH2).
Step 4: The presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) and a carboxylate group (-COO-) indicates the molecule might have pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory properties. This feature could relate to genes involved in inflammatory pathways, such as PTGS1 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1).
Step 5: The overall structure of the molecule, with its aromatic rings and functional groups, suggests it could act as a substrate for enzymes like CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Summary of related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CACNA1H, KCNH2, PTGS1, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4.
