Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)OC(=O)[NH+]1CCC(Oc2ncnc3c2cnn3-c2ccc(S(C)(=O)=O)cc2F)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this relationship matters or what the implications are.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is often involved in binding to protein targets such as receptors and enzymes. This structural feature could potentially interact with various genes encoding proteins that have similar chemical functional groups.
Step 2: The molecule includes a pyridine ring (C=O), which is a common substructure in ligands that can bind to receptors like adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B) and dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4). These receptors are known to have binding sites for molecules containing this type of functional group.
Step 3: The presence of a thioether group (-S-) and a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) suggests potential interactions with cysteine residues or other sulfur-containing amino acids in proteins, which might be relevant to genes encoding proteins with redox functions or signaling pathways (e.g., CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6).
Step 4: The aromatic amide group (-CONH-) is a common motif in compounds that act as agonists or antagonists of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which include genes like HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 5: Given the complex structure and the presence of multiple functional groups, the molecule may also interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6, due to their ability to catalyze reactions involving these groups.
