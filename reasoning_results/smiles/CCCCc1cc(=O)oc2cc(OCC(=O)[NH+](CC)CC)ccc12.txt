Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCc1cc(=O)oc2cc(OCC(=O)[NH+](CC)CC)ccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups, including an amide group (-CONH-) and a phenyl ring. The presence of the amide group suggests that this molecule could be an inhibitor or activator of enzymes or receptors that interact with amide bonds. This is relevant to several genes involved in enzyme function and receptor activity.
Step 2: Notably, the molecule contains a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to a benzene ring, which is characteristic of many drugs that target G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature is particularly relevant to genes encoding GPCRs such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) could indicate that the molecule is capable of forming hydrogen bonds with proteins, which might be relevant to genes involved in protein-protein interactions, such as those encoding kinases like CDK2, or receptors like PTGS1.
Step 4: The molecule also includes a quinolone-like structure, which is known to interact with certain enzymes and receptors. This could be relevant to genes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are involved in drug metabolism and have quinolone-like structures themselves.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CDK2, PTGS1, and HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6. These genes are involved in various physiological processes including neurotransmission, hormone signaling, and drug metabolism. 
Summary of related genes:
- ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4
- CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4
- CDK2, PTGS1
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
These genes play key roles in processes that could be influenced by the molecule's structure, such as receptor binding, enzyme activity, and neurotransmitter function.
