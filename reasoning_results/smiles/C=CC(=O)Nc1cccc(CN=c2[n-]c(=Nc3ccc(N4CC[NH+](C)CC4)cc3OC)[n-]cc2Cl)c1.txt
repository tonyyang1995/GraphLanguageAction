Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C=CC(=O)Nc1cccc(CN=c2[n-]c(=Nc3ccc(N4CC[NH+](C)CC4)cc3OC)[n-]cc2Cl)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, characterized by a benzylamine core and a carboxamide group. This structure suggests potential interactions with cholinergic receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the carboxamide group and the aromatic ring system indicates possible binding to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which are involved in the function of the ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4 genes.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a pyrrolidine ring, which might interact with the G-protein coupled receptor HTR2A, associated with the HTR2A gene, and possibly other related genes like HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, involved in serotonin signaling.
Step 4: The presence of a quinolone-like structure could indicate potential interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, which are encoded by the CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 genes.
Step 5: The molecule does not have direct structural features that are clearly linked to ABCB1, ABL1, CDK2, CACNA1H, CACNA1H, CA12, CA2, CA9, CNR1, CYP1A2, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, ESR1, FLT1, HRH1, KDR, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, PPARG, PTGS1, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2, or SL6A4 genes.
Related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C19, CYP2D6. Step 1: The molecule is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, characterized by a benzylamine core and a carboxamide group.
Step 2: The structure may interact with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs).
Step 3: Potential binding to nAChRs suggests relevance to ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4 genes.
Step 4: The quinolone-like structure hints at interaction with CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 enzymes.
Step 5: No clear structural features link the molecule to other listed genes.
Related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C19, CYP2D6.
