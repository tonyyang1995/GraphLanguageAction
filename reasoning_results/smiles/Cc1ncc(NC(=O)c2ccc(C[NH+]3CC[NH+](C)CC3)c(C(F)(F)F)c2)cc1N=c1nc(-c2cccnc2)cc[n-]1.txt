Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ncc(NC(=O)c2ccc(C[NH+]3CC[NH+](C)CC3)c(C(F)(F)F)c2)cc1N=c1nc(-c2cccnc2)cc[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups, including amides, amines, and fluorine atoms. This indicates that it could potentially interact with proteins involved in various cellular processes such as neurotransmission, signal transduction, and enzymatic reactions.
Step 2: Upon closer inspection, the molecule contains an amide group (-CONH-) which is characteristic of compounds that can act as ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Specifically, the presence of this functional group suggests potential interaction with adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule's structure includes nitrogen-containing heterocycles and amine functionalities, which are common in compounds that modulate the activity of enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are known to metabolize many drugs and endogenous substances.
Step 4: Furthermore, the presence of fluorine atoms (-CF3) in the molecule suggests it may be a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) derivative, which could interact with genes involved in inflammatory pathways such as PTGS1 (COX-1/COX-2), which are key enzymes in the biosynthesis of prostaglandins.
Step 5: Given the above structural features and their implications for biological activity, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, PTGS1. 
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, PTGS1.
