Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COC(=O)N=c1[n-]c2ccc(Sc3ccccc3)cc2[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a structure that includes a benzene ring with an amide group and a nitro group. This pattern suggests it could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction and receptor activity.
Step 2: Looking at the genes provided, several are associated with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are known to bind ligands and activate downstream signaling pathways. Notably, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4 are all GPCRs that recognize various neurotransmitters and hormones.
Step 3: The molecule's presence of a nitro group might be particularly relevant for the interaction with certain GPCRs, as nitro groups can modulate receptor binding affinity and activity. This is especially pertinent for genes like CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4, which are cholinergic receptors sensitive to acetylcholine and other agonists.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule contains a pyridine ring, which is often involved in interactions with enzymes such as those encoded by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are involved in drug metabolism. This suggests potential metabolic interactions with these genes.
Step 5: Based on the structural features of the molecule, the related genes are primarily those involved in receptor function (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19). These genes play crucial roles in signaling pathways and drug response mechanisms.
