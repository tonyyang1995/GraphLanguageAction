Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC1CCC[NH+](C(=O)c2sc3cc([N+](=O)[O-])ccc3c2Cl)C1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple rings, a nitrogen atom with a positive charge, and a carboxylic acid group. The presence of a positively charged nitrogen suggests it could act as an electrophile, potentially binding to nucleophiles such as amino acid residues in proteins.
Step 2: The pattern of the molecule includes a benzene ring with a carboxamide group (-CONH+) attached to it, which could interact with acidic amino acids like glutamic acid or aspartic acid, which are common in protein active sites. Additionally, the presence of a chloride ion (-Cl) might allow for interactions with chloride-binding sites in certain receptors.
Step 3: Considering the structure, this molecule could interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly those that have chloride-binding sites or acidic residues in their binding pockets. Examples include adrenergic receptors (such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (such as CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 4: The molecule may also interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), given its complex aromatic structure and potential for metabolism through these enzymes.
Step 5: The molecule could potentially affect neurotransmitter systems due to its interaction with GPCRs, which play crucial roles in signaling pathways involved in mood regulation, pain perception, and other physiological processes. Relevant genes include HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and DRD2, among others.
Summary of related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2.
