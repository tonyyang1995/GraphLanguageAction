Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1ccc2cc([O-])c([O-])cc2o1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule with a structure that includes a benzene ring, a cyano group (-CN), and multiple oxygen atoms, including an alcohol (-OH) and a carboxylate (-COO-) group. This structure suggests the molecule could be an inhibitor or activator of enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and a cyano group is common in molecules that interact with various enzymes and receptors. Benzene rings are often found in substrates for enzymes like CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) which are involved in phase I drug metabolism. The cyano group might indicate a potential interaction with ion channels or other proteins, such as KCNH2.
Step 3: Given the presence of a carboxylate group (-COO-), this molecule could potentially act as a ligand for receptors that bind to negatively charged groups, such as HTR2A (serotonin receptor), which binds to various ligands including those with carboxylate groups.
Step 4: The overall structure does not strongly suggest direct interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or kinases listed in the provided genes. However, it may have indirect effects through modulating the activity of enzymes that process drugs, leading to altered receptor function.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential to influence enzyme activity and receptor binding, the most likely related genes from the list are CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, and possibly KCNH2.
Summary of related genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, KCNH2.
