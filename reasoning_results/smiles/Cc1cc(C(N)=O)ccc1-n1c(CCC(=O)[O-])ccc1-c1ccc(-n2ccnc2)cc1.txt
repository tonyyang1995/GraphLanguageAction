Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc(C(N)=O)ccc1-n1c(CCC(=O)[O-])ccc1-c1ccc(-n2ccnc2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this information may be useful.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a nitrogen atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom (N=O), which is characteristic of a nitrile group. This nitrile group is commonly found in drugs that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a carboxylate group (-COO-) and a phenol group (-OH). These functional groups are often associated with compounds that inhibit or activate enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways, such as kinases.
Step 3: Notably, the presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group and a carboxylate group suggests the molecule could potentially act as an inhibitor of certain enzymes like tyrosine kinases, which are encoded by genes such as ABL1 and KDR.
Step 4: Additionally, the complex aromatic structure and the presence of a nitrile group suggest the molecule might interact with ion channels, which are encoded by genes like KCNH2 and CACNA1H.
Step 5: Based on the structural features described, the molecule is likely to have interactions with the following genes: ABL1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CACNA1H, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, KDR, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
