Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(-c2csc(Cc3nc(-c4cc5ccccc5oc4=O)cs3)n2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule provided is a complex organic compound that appears to be a derivative of benzene, with additional functional groups such as hydroxyl (-OH), carbonyl (C=O), and sulfonyl (SO2). These structural features suggest the molecule could interact with enzymes or receptors that are involved in metabolic pathways or signaling processes.
Step 2: Among the listed genes, those involved in drug metabolism, particularly those encoding cytochrome P450 enzymes, would be most relevant due to their role in metabolizing xenobiotic compounds. Specifically, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are known to be involved in the metabolism of various drugs and are highly polymorphic, affecting drug response and efficacy.
Step 3: Another set of genes that might be related to this molecule are those encoding receptors for neurotransmitters and hormones, as the molecule's structure suggests potential interactions with these biological systems. Genes like DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), HTR2A (serotonin receptor 5-HT2A), and ESR1 (estrogen receptor alpha) are directly involved in neurotransmission and hormone signaling, which could potentially be affected by the molecule.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure hints at possible interactions with ion channels and transporters, as evidenced by its hydrophobic and polar functional groups. Genes such as KCNH2 (potassium channel subfamily H member 2) and SLC6A4 (sodium-iodide symporter) encode proteins that are involved in ion transport and could be influenced by the molecule.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis and the potential biological roles, the related genes to this molecule include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A, ESR1, KCNH2, and SLC6A4.
