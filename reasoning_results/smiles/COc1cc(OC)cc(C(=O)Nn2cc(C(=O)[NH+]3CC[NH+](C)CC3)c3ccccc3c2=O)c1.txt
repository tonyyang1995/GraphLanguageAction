Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc(OC)cc(C(=O)Nn2cc(C(=O)[NH+]3CC[NH+](C)CC3)c3ccccc3c2=O)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with an amide group (-CONH2) attached, which is characteristic of several drugs that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature suggests potential interactions with genes encoding GPCRs.
Step 2: The presence of a pyridine ring and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) indicates the molecule could be a ligand for enzymes involved in metabolism, such as CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Step 3: The molecule also has a quinoline ring, which might indicate potential interactions with genes involved in signal transduction pathways, such as HRH1 (histamine receptor H1).
Step 4: The presence of a benzene ring with an oxygen-containing side chain suggests possible interactions with genes involved in neurotransmitter transport or signaling, like HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A), HTR2B (serotonin receptor 2B), and SLC6A4 (solute carrier family 6, member 4, which transports serotonin).
Step 5: Given the complexity of the molecule and its functional groups, it is likely to interact with multiple genes involved in various biological processes, including but not limited to the ones mentioned above.
