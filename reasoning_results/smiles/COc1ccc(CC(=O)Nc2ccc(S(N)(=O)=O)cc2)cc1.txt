Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(CC(=O)Nc2ccc(S(N)(=O)=O)cc2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings and functional groups, including an amide (CON), a sulfonamide (S(N)(=O)), and a benzene ring (CC). This indicates that the molecule likely interacts with proteins involved in cellular signaling, transport, or metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)) suggests that this molecule could potentially interact with enzymes or receptors that have sulfonamide-binding sites, such as those found in drug targets like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These enzymes are involved in the metabolism of various drugs.
Step 3: The amide (CON) and benzene ring structures might indicate that the molecule could bind to proteins with similar structural motifs, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or ion channels. GPCRs are often targeted by drugs affecting neurotransmitter systems, which include DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. Ion channels, such as KCNH2, might also be relevant if the molecule affects ion flow.
Step 4: Given the presence of a carboxylic acid group (CO) and the overall complexity of the molecule, it could potentially act as a ligand for receptors or enzymes that bind to acidic compounds, such as SLC6A2, SLC6A4, or PTGS1. These genes encode transporters and enzymes involved in various biological processes.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure, the most likely related genes are: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, PTGS1. These genes are involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmission, and inflammation, respectively. The molecule's structure suggests potential interactions with these genes' encoded proteins.
