Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[N+](C)(C)CC(=O)[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule is a compound with a positively charged nitrogen atom, indicating it may be an amine derivative. This feature could interact with receptors that have binding sites for amine compounds, such as certain G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 2: The molecule contains a carboxyl group (-COOH), which might indicate it could act as an acid or interact with proteins that have carboxylate binding sites, such as ion channels or transporters.
Step 3: The presence of multiple aromatic rings suggests the molecule could be a ligand for enzymes involved in drug metabolism, like cytochrome P450s (CYP enzymes), which are encoded by genes such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
Step 4: Given the structure includes a benzene ring and a carboxylic acid group, this molecule could potentially bind to or modulate voltage-gated calcium channels, such as CACNA1H, which encodes the alpha subunit of T-type calcium channels.
Step 5: The molecule’s overall structure and functional groups suggest it could interact with various neurotransmitter receptors, including dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
