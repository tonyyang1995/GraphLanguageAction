Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(-c2cc(C(=O)Nc3cc(OC)c(OC)c(OC)c3)no2)cc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other type of explanation.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an amide (-CONH2) group, suggesting potential interactions with enzymes that metabolize drugs containing these functional groups, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrophenol group (NO2) could indicate potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism like CYP1A2.
Step 3: The molecule has a quinoline-like structure, which might suggest potential interactions with enzymes such as CYP3A4.
Step 4: The presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) could indicate potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism like CYP2C9.
Step 5: The overall structure includes multiple functional groups that could interact with various receptors and transporters, such as CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and SLC6A4.
Summary of related gene names: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, SLC6A4.
