Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N#Cc1c(NC(=O)c2ccc(Br)o2)n(-c2ccccc2)c2nc3ccccc3nc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with multiple functional groups including a nitrogen atom with a triple bond (N#C), a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and various aromatic rings and substituents such as bromine (Br) and amide bonds. This structure suggests the molecule could be an analgesic, anti-inflammatory, or anti-cancer agent due to its diverse functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) indicates that this molecule could act as an agonist or antagonist for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like adrenergic and cholinergic receptors. These receptors are involved in neurotransmission and are regulated by various genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 3: The nitrogen atom with a triple bond (N#C) and the amide bonds suggest potential interactions with enzymes such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes, which are involved in drug metabolism. Specifically, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 could be relevant as they metabolize many drugs, including analgesics and anti-inflammatory agents.
Step 4: Given the complex structure and the presence of functional groups that can interact with GPCRs and enzymes, this molecule might also influence signaling pathways associated with receptors and enzymes mentioned above. This could include pathways involving genes like PTGS1 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1), which is involved in inflammation, and HRH1 (histamine H1 receptor), which is part of the histaminergic system.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the most likely related genes to this molecule are those encoding for GPCRs (adrenergic and cholinergic receptors) and enzymes involved in drug metabolism (CYP isozymes). Therefore, the related gene names are:
- ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2
- CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6
- PTGS1, HRH1
These genes play key roles in the pharmacological activity and metabolism of the described molecule. The summary lists the genes based on their involvement in receptor activation and metabolic pathways influenced by the molecule's structure.
