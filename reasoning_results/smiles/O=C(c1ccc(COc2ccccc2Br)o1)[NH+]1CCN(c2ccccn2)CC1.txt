Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(c1ccc(COc2ccccc2Br)o1)[NH+]1CCN(c2ccccn2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring system, which is characteristic of many ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature suggests potential interaction with GPCRs.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and a nitrile group (-CN) could indicate a possible interaction with enzymes involved in drug metabolism such as CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize various drugs including those that bind to GPCRs.
Step 3: The molecule also includes an amide group (-CONH-), which can form hydrogen bonds and contribute to binding interactions with receptors like DRD2, DRD3, and HTR2A, all of which are GPCRs.
Step 4: Given the presence of a benzene ring and a quaternary ammonium group ([NH+]), this compound may interact with ion channels, particularly those involving KCNH2, which codes for the hERG potassium channel.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and functional groups identified, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism, including: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, HTR2A, KCNH2. Step 5: Summary of related gene names: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, HTR2A, KCNH2. These genes are involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmission, suggesting the molecule may interact with them.
