Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+](C)CCCn1cc(C2=C(c3c[nH]c4ccccc34)C(=O)NC2=O)c2ccccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple functional groups such as amine, carboxyl, and cyclic structures. It has a basic nitrogen atom attached to a benzene ring, indicating potential interactions with proteins that have basic binding sites.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxyl group (-COOH) suggests the molecule could be an acid or a salt, which might interact with proton pumps or transporters. This structural feature may relate to genes involved in proton transport or metabolism.
Step 3: The cyclic structures within the molecule, particularly the heterocycles like pyrrole and pyridine, are common in ligands for receptors and enzymes. These could interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or other signaling molecules.
Step 4: Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, this molecule likely interacts with several targets rather than a single gene. However, its potential interactions with transporters, receptors, and enzymes make it relevant to genes involved in these processes, such as drug metabolism and neurotransmission.
Step 5: Based on the molecule’s structure and potential interactions, the related genes include those involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), neurotransmission (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), and ion channels (CACNA1H, KCNH2). 
Summary of related genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CACNA1H, KCNH2.
