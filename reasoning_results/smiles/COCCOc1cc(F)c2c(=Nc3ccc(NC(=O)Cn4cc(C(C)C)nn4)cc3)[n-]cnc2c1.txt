Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COCCOc1cc(F)c2c(=Nc3ccc(NC(=O)Cn4cc(C(C)C)nn4)cc3)[n-]cnc2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure including an aromatic ring system, a furan ring, and several nitrogen-containing heterocycles such as pyrrolidine and pyridine. These structural features suggest potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for similar chemical motifs.
Step 2: Among the given genes, those involved in neurotransmitter systems are more likely to be related to this molecule due to its potential to bind to receptors. Notable neurotransmitter-related genes include HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode various subtypes of serotonin receptors.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a quinoline-like structure (COCCO), which could interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism. This includes CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize a wide range of drugs.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a benzene ring and other aromatic groups might suggest potential interactions with kinases or other signaling molecules. Genes like LCK and PTGS1 (COX-2) could be relevant here, although their connection would require further investigation.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the following genes are potentially associated with the molecule: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, LCK, and PTGS1. These genes are involved in neurotransmission, drug metabolism, and cellular signaling pathways.
Related Gene Names:
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- HTR6
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP3A4
- LCK
- PTGS1
These genes are the most likely candidates for interaction based on the molecule's structure and the biological processes it may influence. Further experimental validation would be necessary to confirm these relationships.
