Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCc1nc(Cl)c(CO)n1Cc1ccc(-c2ccccc2-c2nn[n-]n2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that contains several functional groups such as aromatic rings, amine groups, and a cyano group. These structural features suggest potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for similar chemical functionalities.
Step 2: Among the provided genes, those involved in neurotransmitter receptors and signaling pathways are likely to be relevant due to the presence of amine groups and potential binding sites for ligands. Examples include HTR1A (serotonin receptor), HTR2A (serotonin receptor), HTR2B (serotonin receptor), and HTR2C (serotonin receptor).
Step 3: The molecule also has a cyano group (-CN), which could interact with enzymes that metabolize drugs and xenobiotics, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. These enzymes are involved in Phase I drug metabolism, which is crucial for the activation or deactivation of many pharmaceuticals.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of aromatic rings and amine groups may indicate potential interactions with ion channels and transporters. For instance, KCNH2 encodes a potassium channel, and SLC6A4 is a serotonin transporter, both of which might be influenced by the molecule's structure.
Step 5: Given the complexity of the molecule and its functional groups, it is plausible that it could interact with multiple targets, including some of the listed genes. However, based on the provided information, the most likely related genes are those involved in neurotransmitter receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C) and drug metabolism enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4).
Summary of Related Gene Names:
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP3A4 Step 5: Summary of Related Gene Names:
- CYP3A4
These genes are likely to be related to the given molecule due to the presence of functional groups in the molecule that could interact with their respective protein targets. The neurotransmitter receptors and drug-metabolizing enzymes are the primary candidates based on the molecular structure described.
