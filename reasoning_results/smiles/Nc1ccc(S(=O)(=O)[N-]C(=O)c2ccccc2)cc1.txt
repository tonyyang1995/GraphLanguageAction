Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Nc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)[N-]C(=O)c2ccccc2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that contains a sulfoxide (S(=O)(=O)) functional group, a nitro group (N), and a series of aromatic rings connected by single and double bonds. This complex structure suggests the molecule may interact with proteins involved in signal transduction, enzyme activity, or receptor binding.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of the nitro group and the overall complexity of the molecule indicate potential interactions with enzymes and receptors involved in various signaling pathways. This complexity could lead to the molecule influencing the expression or function of genes related to signal transduction and receptor binding.
Step 3: Among the provided genes, those involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling and neurotransmitter systems are particularly relevant due to their roles in signal transduction and receptor binding. These include HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode for serotonin receptors; DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which encode for dopamine receptors; and CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4, which encode for muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure might interact with enzymes such as CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics. This interaction could influence the expression or function of these genes.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions with biological systems, the related genes can be summarized as follows:
- Serotonin receptors: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- Dopamine receptors: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4
- Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4
- Drug-metabolizing enzymes: CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6
Summary of Related Genes: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6.
