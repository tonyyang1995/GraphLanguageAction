Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)C[NH+]1C(=O)Nc2ccc(Br)cc2C1c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure including a benzene ring system, an amide group, and a quaternary ammonium salt. This suggests that the molecule could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction, ion channels, or transporters.
Step 2: Notably, the molecule contains a quaternary ammonium group which is characteristic of certain ligands for receptors like muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (MChRs), such as M1 (CHRM1), M3 (CHRM3), and M4 (CHRM4). These receptors are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that play crucial roles in neurotransmission and are known to be modulated by various ligands.
Step 3: The presence of an amide group indicates potential for interactions with enzymes or proteins involved in metabolic pathways. For instance, CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) are known to metabolize many drugs and xenobiotics, and their activity can influence drug efficacy and toxicity.
Step 4: Additionally, the benzene ring system could suggest interaction with proteins involved in cell signaling pathways. For example, HRH1 (histamine H1 receptor) and KDR (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2) both have aromatic binding sites that might interact with the benzene rings of the molecule.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes are likely to be those encoding receptors and enzymes that interact with similar ligands. Therefore, the list of related genes includes: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HRH1, KDR. Summary:
- CHRM1
- CHRM3
- CHRM4
- CYP1A2
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- HRH1
- KDR Step 5: Summary of Related Genes - CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HRH1, KDR.
