Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string [NH3+]CCc1ccccc1 represents a molecule that starts with an amine group (-NH3+) attached to a benzene ring (CC) through a carbon atom. This amine group is likely to be involved in hydrogen bonding or other types of interactions with proteins. The benzene ring and its substituents suggest potential for aromatic interactions and electronic effects.
Step 2: The structure contains a benzene ring with a phenyl substituent, which is common in many drugs and ligands that interact with receptors or enzymes. This aromatic system could enable the molecule to bind to protein targets that have hydrophobic pockets or regions rich in aromatic residues.
Step 3: The presence of a tertiary amine group (-NH3+) at the beginning of the molecule suggests it could act as a basic compound, potentially interacting with acidic sites on proteins, including ion channels, receptors, or transporters. Such interactions are often seen in modulating the activity of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels.
Step 4: Given the pattern of the molecule and its potential to interact with proteins, we can infer that it might influence the activity of several genes encoding for GPCRs, ion channels, and transporters. Specific examples include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and OPRK1, all of which encode for GPCRs or ion channels.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule may also interact with CYP enzymes due to its aromatic nature, which could affect the metabolism of drugs encoded by genes such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These genes play crucial roles in drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics.
