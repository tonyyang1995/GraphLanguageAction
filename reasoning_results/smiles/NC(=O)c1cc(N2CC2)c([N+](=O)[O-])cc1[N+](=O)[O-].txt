Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NC(=O)c1cc(N2CC2)c([N+](=O)[O-])cc1[N+](=O)[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a structure that includes a pyrrolidine ring fused to an oxazole ring (NC(=O)c1cc(N2CC2)c([N+](=O)[O-])cc1), which suggests it could be a ligand for receptors or enzymes. This pattern is characteristic of many drugs that interact with neurotransmitter receptors.
Step 2: The presence of the [N+] and [O-] ions indicates the molecule contains a positively charged nitrogen and a negatively charged oxygen, which could be involved in electrostatic interactions with ion channels or receptors.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a phenolic group (c1cc(N2CC2)c([N+](=O)[O-])cc1) that could interact with receptors or enzymes through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions.
Step 4: Considering the molecular structure and functional groups, this compound might interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels, which are encoded by several of the listed genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KDR, LCK, and MCL1.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule’s structure may also influence the activity of enzymes like CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize various drugs.
Summary of related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KDR, LCK, MCL1, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6.
