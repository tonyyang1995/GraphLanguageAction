Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(=O)c1ccc2c(c1)Nc1ccccc1S2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string "CC(=O)c1ccc2c(c1)Nc1ccccc1S2" is a chemical compound that contains a benzene ring system, an amide group (-CONH-), and a thiol (-SH) group. The presence of the amide and thiol functional groups suggests that this molecule could be involved in interactions with proteins containing similar functional groups.
Step 2: The benzene ring in the molecule could interact with aromatic amino acids such as tryptophan (W) or tyrosine (Y) found in various receptors and transporters. This interaction might affect the conformation and function of these proteins.
Step 3: Given the presence of the thiol group, this molecule could potentially act as a ligand for proteins containing cysteine residues, which are common in G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, as well as other proteins such as HRH1 and HTR1A-HTR6.
Step 4: The amide group could interact with charged amino acids, particularly those found in ion channels and transporters. For example, it could bind to the ATP binding site of kinases like CDK2, or interact with ion channels such as KCNH2.
Step 5: Considering the identified functional groups and their potential interactions, the related genes include: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CDK2, KCNH2.
Summary of related genes: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CDK2, KCNH2.
