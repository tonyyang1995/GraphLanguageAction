Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Cn1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])n1)NCc1cccs1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound that includes a pyrrole ring system, an amide group, and a quinoline ring. This structure suggests it may interact with enzymes or receptors involved in metabolism or neurotransmission.
Step 2: The presence of a quinoline ring is particularly notable as it can be found in many drugs that are metabolized by CYP enzymes, specifically CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. These enzymes are known to be involved in the metabolism of various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a nitrile group (-CN), which is known to be metabolized by CYP2C19, another important drug-metabolizing enzyme.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a pyrrole ring and a quinoline ring could potentially interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C encode for various subtypes of GPCRs, including adrenergic and serotonin receptors, which could be influenced by this molecule.
Step 5: Given the metabolic pathways and receptor interactions suggested by the molecule's structure, the related genes include: CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP2C19, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C.
