Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)(C)c1cc([O-])c(C(C)(C)C)cc1[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with attached substituents, including a hydroxyl group and an amide. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and amide functionality may indicate a possible interaction with CYP enzymes, specifically CYP2D6 and CYP2C9, which are known to metabolize drugs containing these functional groups.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a quinoline-like structure, which could suggest a potential interaction with CYP3A4, another enzyme involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: Given the presence of an amine and a carboxylic acid group, this molecule might interact with receptors such as HTR2A and HTR2B, which are involved in serotonin signaling.
Step 5: Based on the identified structural features, the related genes are: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with attached substituents, including a hydroxyl group and an amide. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 5: Based on the identified structural features, the related genes are: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B. 
Summary of Related Genes: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B.
