Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cccc(CC(=O)N=c2[n-]c(-c3ccncc3)cs2)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a tricyclic structure with a central benzene ring, which is common in many ligands that interact with receptors and transport proteins. This structural feature suggests potential interactions with genes encoding receptors or transporters.
Step 2: The presence of a carbonyl group (-CO-) and a nitro group (-NO2) indicates the molecule could be an inhibitor or activator of enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways. This points to possible interactions with genes encoding kinases, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), and other signaling molecules.
Step 3: The molecule includes a quinoline moiety (quinoline is part of the structure), which is known to interact with various receptors and ion channels. This structural feature might suggest interactions with genes such as those encoding adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 4: The presence of a pyrrolidine ring and a phenylacetyl group may indicate the molecule's ability to modulate the activity of enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). These enzymes are crucial for drug metabolism and detoxification processes.
Step 5: Given the overall structure and functional groups, the molecule could potentially interact with genes encoding neurotransmitter receptors, such as dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) and serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), due to its ability to mimic or inhibit neurotransmitter binding.
