Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: c1ccc(OCCSc2nc3ccccc3[n-]2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains an oxygen-containing functional group (OCC), which suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolic pathways. This includes CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize drugs containing oxygen-containing functional groups.
Step 2: The molecule also has a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring ([n-]), indicating possible interaction with receptors that bind basic molecules. This could involve HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are serotonin receptors.
Step 3: The presence of aromatic rings (c1ccc) and the overall molecular structure suggest potential binding to ion channels. CACNA1H and KCNH2, which are calcium and potassium voltage-gated channel subunits respectively, might be affected.
Step 4: The molecule’s complex structure with multiple rings and heteroatoms could interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This includes ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are dopamine receptors.
Step 5: The presence of a benzene ring and substituents like alkyl chains may indicate potential interactions with kinases. LCK, which is a tyrosine kinase, might be a candidate for such interactions.
