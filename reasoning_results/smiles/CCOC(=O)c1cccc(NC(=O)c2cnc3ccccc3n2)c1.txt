Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)c1cccc(NC(=O)c2cnc3ccccc3n2)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule with a benzene ring fused to an oxazole ring, containing a carboxamide group, and a pyrrole ring. This structure suggests that the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways, such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) or enzymes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group indicates potential for binding to proteins with acidic residues, which is common in ligands targeting GPCRs. The benzene ring and oxazole ring are characteristic of molecules that can interact with the transmembrane domains of GPCRs, facilitating their activation or inhibition.
Step 3: The pyrrole ring in the molecule may contribute to its ability to interact with ion channels or other membrane-bound proteins, such as those involved in calcium signaling. This is relevant to genes like CACNA1H, which encodes a calcium channel subunit.
Step 4: Given the structure's potential to interact with both GPCRs and ion channels, it is likely to affect neurotransmission and signaling pathways. Genes such as DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HRH1, which are involved in dopamine, serotonin, and histamine receptor signaling, respectively, could be influenced by this molecule.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule's structure might also impact enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize various drugs and could potentially be affected by this molecule.
