Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)Nc1ccc(=NCc2ccc(F)cc2)[n-]c1N, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with several functional groups including an amide (CO), an ester (OC(=O)), a benzene ring, and a nitrogen atom that forms part of a heterocyclic ring system. These features suggest that the molecule could be involved in interactions with proteins that have similar chemical functionalities.
Step 2: Considering the presence of the amide group (-CONH-) and the ester group (O=C-O), it is likely that this molecule could interact with enzymes that metabolize drugs or other small molecules, such as those encoded by CYP (cytochrome P450) genes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These enzymes are known to oxidize substrates, which might involve reactions similar to those catalyzed by the amide and ester groups in the molecule.
Step 3: The nitrogen atom in the molecule is part of a heterocyclic ring system, which is common in ligands that bind to receptors or ion channels. This suggests potential interactions with genes encoding for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels. For example, HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A) and CHRM1 (cholinergic receptor muscarinic M1) both have heterocyclic rings in their structures and could potentially interact with the given molecule due to its structural similarity.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a benzene ring in the molecule indicates that it may also interact with enzymes involved in phase I metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP3A4, which further supports the involvement of CYP-related genes.
Step 5: Given the above analysis, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, CHRM1.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP1A2
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- HTR2A
- CHRM1
Note: Other genes listed were not directly supported by the molecule's structure based on the given information. However, they could still be relevant depending on additional context or experimental evidence not provided here. The focus was on identifying genes that align with the molecule's chemical structure.
