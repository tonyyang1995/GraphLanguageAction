Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccccc1NC(=O)C[NH+]1CCN(c2ccccc2F)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure containing a benzene ring, a pyrrole ring, and a tetrazole ring. These structural features are often associated with ligands that interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are proteins encoded by many of the listed genes.
Step 2: Notably, the molecule contains a cyano group (-CN) and an amide group (-CONH-), which are common functional groups in drugs targeting GPCRs. This suggests potential interactions with receptors whose activation or inhibition might be modulated by such functional groups.
Step 3: The presence of a fluorine atom (-F) attached to a benzene ring is indicative of a pharmacophore that could influence the binding affinity of the molecule to certain receptors, particularly those involved in neurotransmitter signaling pathways.
Step 4: Given the structural features and functional groups present in the molecule, it is plausible that this compound could interact with receptors encoded by genes such as DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, all of which encode for different subtypes of serotonin receptors, and also CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4, which encode for muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.
Step 5: Therefore, the related genes to the molecule are: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4. 
Summary of Related Genes:
- DRD2
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- HTR6
- CHRM1
- CHRM3
- CHRM4 Step 5: Summary of Related Genes:
