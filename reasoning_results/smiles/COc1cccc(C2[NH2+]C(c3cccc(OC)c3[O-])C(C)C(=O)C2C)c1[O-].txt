Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cccc(C2[NH2+]C(c3cccc(OC)c3[O-])C(C)C(=O)C2C)c1[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system and a quinoline ring fused to it, which suggests potential interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP), particularly CYP2D6 and CYP2C9.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom with a positive charge and an amine group (-NH2+) indicates potential binding sites for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are dopamine receptors.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which could interact with ion channels like KCNH2 and HTR2C, and possibly with adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2).
Step 4: The molecule has a pyrrolidine ring and an indole ring, which might be recognized by enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP3A4 and CYP1A2.
Step 5: Given the above structural features, the molecule is likely related to the genes CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, CYP1A2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, and KCNH2.
