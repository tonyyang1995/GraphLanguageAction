Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(Oc2ccnc3cc(-c4cnn(C5CC[NH2+]CC5)c4)ccc23)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is characteristic of many drug molecules. This structural feature may interact with various drug targets.
Step 2: The presence of an oxygen atom in the molecule suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in phase I metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 3: The molecule also has a quinolone-like structure, which could potentially interact with proteins like CYP3A4, known for its role in metabolizing various drugs.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocycle might suggest interactions with receptors or ion channels, such as DRD2, HTR2A, and KCNH2.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and functional groups, the molecule is likely to be related to CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, and KCNH2.
Related genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, KCNH2.
