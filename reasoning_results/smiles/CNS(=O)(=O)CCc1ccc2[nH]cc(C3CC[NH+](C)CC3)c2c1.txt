Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CNS(=O)(=O)CCc1ccc2[nH]cc(C3CC[NH+](C)CC3)c2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex structure that includes a benzene ring, a carboxylic acid group (CNS(=O)(=O)), and a heterocyclic amine group (N=[NH+]C). The presence of the carboxylic acid group suggests the molecule could be an inhibitor or activator of enzymes involved in metabolism.
Step 2: The heterocyclic amine group (N=[NH+]C) indicates the molecule may interact with receptors that bind amine compounds, such as adrenergic and cholinergic receptors. This feature aligns with several genes listed, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 3: The presence of the benzene ring and the carboxylic acid group might also suggest the molecule could potentially interact with genes involved in signal transduction pathways, such as HRH1 and KDR, which are associated with G-protein coupled receptors and tyrosine kinase activity, respectively.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure could influence the expression or function of genes involved in drug metabolism and transport, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and SLC6A4, due to its potential to act as a substrate or inhibitor of these enzymes.
Step 5: Given the structure and properties of the molecule, it is likely to have interactions with the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, KDR, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and SLC6A4.
