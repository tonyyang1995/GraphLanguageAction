Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COCCCOc1ccnc(C[S+](O)c2nc3ccccc3[n-]2)c1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with multiple substituents including an amide group (-CONH2), a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and a sulfonamide group (-S(O)NH2). These functional groups suggest the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors that interact with these chemical moieties.
Step 2: The presence of the amide and carboxylic acid groups implies the molecule might have affinity for enzymes such as CYP (cytochrome P450) enzymes, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics. Specifically, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are known to metabolize molecules containing these functional groups.
Step 3: The sulfonamide group suggests potential interactions with enzymes like CYP3A4, which also metabolizes a wide range of substrates, including those with sulfonamide moieties.
Step 4: The overall structure and functional groups of the molecule indicate it could potentially act as an agonist or antagonist at G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A) and HTR2B (serotonin receptor 2B), which often bind molecules with similar structural features.
Step 5: Given the potential for interaction with CYP enzymes and GPCRs, the related genes include CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, and HTR2B.
Summary of related genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with multiple substituents including an amide group (-CONH2), a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and a sulfonamide group (-S(O)NH2). These functional groups suggest the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors that interact with these chemical moieties.
Summary of related genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B. 
To summarize, the related genes are:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
These genes are associated with enzymes involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmitter receptors, respectively. The molecule's structure suggests it may interact with these biological targets. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with multiple substituents including
