Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [NH2+]=C1NC(c2cccc(-c3cncnc3)c2)(c2ccnc(C(F)F)c2)c2cccc(F)c21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex molecule with a positive nitrogen atom, indicating it has an amine group that can act as a proton donor (NH2+). This suggests the molecule could be an alkaloid or a similar compound that might interact with receptors or ion channels.
Step 2: The presence of multiple aromatic rings and heteroatoms like fluorine (-F) and nitrogen, along with double bonds, indicates the molecule likely possesses lipophilic and polar characteristics. This type of chemical structure can facilitate interactions with membrane-bound proteins such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: Considering the pattern of the molecule, it could potentially interact with genes encoding for neurotransmitter receptors or ion channels due to its chemical properties. Specifically, the molecule might bind to receptors that modulate neuronal signaling.
Step 4: Given the potential interaction with neurotransmitter receptors, the molecule may be related to several genes involved in the regulation of neurotransmission, including HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode serotonin receptors, and DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which encode dopamine receptors.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule might also interact with other genes involved in signal transduction pathways, such as PTGS1, which encodes cyclooxygenase-1, an enzyme involved in prostaglandin synthesis, and CYP2D6, which encodes cytochrome P450 enzymes responsible for drug metabolism.
