Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1cc(N2CCOCC2)oc2c(-c3cccc4c3sc3ccccc34)cccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule, which appears to be a derivative of a benzene ring with various substituents including a nitrile group (CN), an amide group (-CO-), and alkyl chains. This structure suggests potential interactions with receptors or enzymes that are involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The molecule contains a nitrile group and an amide group, which could indicate it might interact with enzymes such as CYP2C19 and CYP2C9. These cytochrome P450 enzymes are known to metabolize drugs and other xenobiotics, and they often bind to molecules containing nitrile and amide functionalities.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of multiple aromatic rings and heteroatoms (such as nitrogen and oxygen) suggests that this molecule could potentially interact with receptors like DRD2, HTR2A, and HTR2B. These are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) involved in neurotransmission, particularly for dopamine and serotonin, which are often targeted by drugs.
Step 4: The alkyl chain and the overall structure also hint at possible interactions with kinases, such as LCK, which is a tyrosine kinase involved in signal transduction pathways. The molecule’s ability to bind to kinases would depend on its hydrophobic and polar regions, which could align with the active site of LCK.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related genes are likely to be those involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C19, CYP2C9) and neurotransmission (DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, LCK). Other genes may not have a direct structural relationship but could be indirectly related through their role in cellular processes that these molecules might influence.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2C19, CYP2C9, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, LCK.
