Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccccc1Oc1ccc(-c2nc(=N)[n-]c(=N)[n-]2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a nitrogen atom attached, which suggests it may be an amine or a substituted amine. This structural feature could potentially interact with receptors that have binding sites for amines, such as adrenergic and cholinergic receptors.
Step 2: The molecule also has a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to the benzene ring. Phenolic compounds can act as ligands for certain enzymes and receptors, particularly those involved in signal transduction pathways and neurotransmission. This could indicate potential interactions with genes encoding proteins that modulate signaling pathways.
Step 3: The presence of a pyrrole ring and a quinoline-like structure (with a nitrogen atom and a carboxyl group) might suggest the molecule has pharmacological activity similar to known drugs targeting G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or other receptor types. This structural complexity could imply a relationship with genes encoding receptors or enzymes that are part of these pathways.
Step 4: Given the potential for interactions with receptors and enzymes, the molecule may be related to genes involved in neurotransmission, signal transduction, and drug metabolism. These include genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and PTGS1.
Step 5: Additionally, due to its possible role in signal transduction and drug metabolism, the molecule might also be associated with genes such as CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are involved in the metabolism of various drugs.
