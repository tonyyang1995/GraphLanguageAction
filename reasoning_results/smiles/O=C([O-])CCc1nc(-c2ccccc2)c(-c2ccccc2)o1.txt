Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])CCc1nc(-c2ccccc2)c(-c2ccccc2)o1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a molecule that includes a carboxylic acid group (O=C), an amide group (C([O-])), and aromatic rings (c1nc(-c2ccccc2)c(-c2ccccc2)o1). This structure suggests the molecule could be an inhibitor or activator of enzymes or receptors involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (O=C) indicates potential binding sites for enzymes such as CYP (Cytochrome P450) family members, which are known to metabolize many drugs and xenobiotics. Additionally, the amide group (C([O-])) might interact with protein targets like kinases or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: Given the aromatic ring system, the molecule could interact with proteins containing transmembrane domains, such as ion channels (e.g., KCNH2, CACNA1H) or GPCRs (e.g., DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4). These interactions would involve the aromatic rings fitting into the hydrophobic pockets of these proteins.
Step 4: The negative charge (-c2ccccc2) in the molecule could suggest it has the ability to interact with positively charged residues on target proteins, potentially affecting the activity of ion channels or receptors like DRD2 and HTR2A.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the most likely related genes are those involved in neurotransmitter signaling and drug metabolism, including CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and CYP1A2.
