Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CSc1nnc(-c2cc(C(C)(C)C)c([O-])c(C(C)(C)C)c2)s1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that includes aromatic rings, heteroatoms such as nitrogen and oxygen, and potentially polar substituents. This structure suggests the molecule could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction, transport, or metabolism.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of aromatic rings and heteroatoms indicates potential for binding to receptors or enzymes. For instance, the nitrogen-containing rings might allow the molecule to interact with ion channels, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), or cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Step 3: Among the provided genes, those encoding for GPCRs (e.g., ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) are particularly relevant due to their ligand-binding domains which often include aromatic and polar residues that can form hydrogen bonds or hydrophobic interactions with small molecules.
Step 4: Additionally, genes encoding for enzymes involved in drug metabolism (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) may also be relevant, as the complex structure of the molecule might interact with these enzymes, affecting their catalytic activity or substrate specificity.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis and the known functions of the provided genes, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. These genes encode proteins that could potentially interact directly or indirectly with the molecule through binding sites or metabolic pathways.
