Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(=O)Nc1cccc(-n2c(=O)n(C3CC3)c(=O)c3c(Nc4ccc(I)cc4F)n(C)c(=O)c(C)c32)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is a common structural feature in many drugs that interact with receptors or enzymes. This pattern is found in molecules that bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and DRD2.
Step 2: The molecule also includes an indole ring, which is characteristic of certain ligands for serotonin receptors. This suggests potential interactions with HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 3: The presence of a quinoline moiety in the molecule could indicate interactions with CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: The overall structure does not strongly suggest direct interaction with ABCB1, ABL1, CDK2, CACNA1H, CYP1A2, EGFR, ESR1, FLT1, HRH1, KDR, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, PPARG, PTGS1, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, or other listed genes without additional context.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related gene names are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. These genes are primarily involved in neurotransmitter receptor function and drug metabolism. 
Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4.
