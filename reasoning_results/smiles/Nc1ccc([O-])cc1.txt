Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Nc1ccc([O-])cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compound with an oxygen atom bearing a negative charge. This molecule likely belongs to a class of organic compounds such as quinolines or isoquinolines, which are known for their ability to interact with various biological targets.
Step 2: The presence of a negatively charged oxygen atom suggests that this molecule could act as a ligand or inhibitor targeting ion channels or receptors that have specific binding sites for negatively charged molecules. This property might allow the molecule to interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels, which are encoded by several of the listed genes.
Step 3: Among the provided genes, those encoding GPCRs are particularly relevant. For example, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 encode different subtypes of adrenergic and cholinergic receptors. These receptors are known to be sensitive to negatively charged ligands due to their extracellular loops containing negatively charged residues.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule may interact with voltage-gated potassium channels encoded by KCNH2, which also have negatively charged regions that could facilitate binding.
Step 5: Given the potential interaction with GPCRs and ion channels, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and KCNH2.
