Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)C(C)(C)Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule with a central carbon atom (C) attached to an oxygen atom (O), which is part of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This group is typical for molecules that can act as inhibitors or substrates for enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP (cytochrome P450) genes.
Step 2: The molecule also contains a benzene ring system with a chlorine atom attached to one of its positions, indicating potential electrophilic reactivity. Such functional groups are often recognized by drug-metabolizing enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are responsible for oxidizing aromatic compounds.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule has a second benzene ring connected to the first via a methylene bridge (CH2), and it is further substituted with a methyl group (CH3) and another chlorine atom. These features suggest that the molecule could interact with various G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or ion channels, which are often targeted by drugs. For instance, CYP2D6, which metabolizes many GPCR ligands, might be relevant here.
Step 4: The presence of multiple chiral centers and the overall complex structure of the molecule indicate that it may have significant interactions with enzymes that are involved in the metabolism of complex organic molecules, such as CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes involved in drug metabolism and signaling pathways, including CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Other potential related genes include those encoding GPCRs and ion channels, such as DRD2, HTR2A, and KCNH2.
