Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc(N2CCC([NH+]3CC[NH+](C)CC3)CC2)ccc1N=c1[n-]cc(Cl)c(=Nc2ccccc2S(=O)(=O)C(C)C)[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains several functional groups including a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (azole), a nitrile group, and a sulfonamide. These structural features are common in drugs that interact with various receptors and transporters.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrile group and a sulfonamide could indicate a potential interaction with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. These enzymes are involved in the biotransformation of xenobiotics and drugs, which might affect the pharmacokinetics of the molecule.
Step 3: The molecule also has a quinoline-like structure, which is known to bind to certain G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Specifically, this pattern could be relevant to HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, as they are serotonin receptors that can be modulated by quinoline derivatives.
Step 4: Given the presence of amine groups and potential interactions with neurotransmitter systems, the molecule may also interact with other GPCRs like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are dopamine receptors.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and the presence of multiple functional groups that can interact with different proteins, the molecule is likely to have a broad range of potential interactions, but it is particularly relevant to the genes encoding for CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
