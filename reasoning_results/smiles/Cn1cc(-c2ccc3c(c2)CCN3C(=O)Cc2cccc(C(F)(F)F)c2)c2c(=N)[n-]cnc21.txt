Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cn1cc(-c2ccc3c(c2)CCN3C(=O)Cc2cccc(C(F)(F)F)c2)c2c(=N)[n-]cnc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound that includes a number of functional groups such as amide, phenyl, and fluorine substituents. It has a cyclic structure with multiple rings, including a pyrrole ring, an indole ring, and a benzene ring.
Step 2: Upon closer inspection, the molecule contains a pyrrole ring which is part of a larger structure that includes a carboxamide group (CONH2) and a benzene ring with substituents. This structure is reminiscent of certain drugs that are known to interact with receptors involved in neurotransmission and hormone signaling, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The presence of a benzene ring with fluorine substituents suggests that the molecule might be designed to interact specifically with certain proteins or receptors. Fluorine atoms can form hydrogen bonds and can also modulate the binding affinity of molecules to their targets.
Step 4: Considering the pharmacological profile of the molecule, it is likely to interact with receptors that are involved in neurotransmission and hormone signaling, such as adrenergic and cholinergic receptors, and possibly GPCRs. This would make the following genes potentially related: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and SIGMAR1.
Step 5: Additionally, due to the presence of a carboxamide group, the molecule could potentially interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. However, without further information about the exact mechanism of action, this is speculative.
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, SIGMAR1, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
