Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N=c1[n-][n-]c(=S)s1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string N=c1[n-][n-]c(=S)s1 consists of a heterocyclic system, specifically a tricyclic structure containing a sulfide and two nitrogen atoms. The presence of multiple nitrogen atoms suggests potential for forming hydrogen bonds, which are crucial for interactions with proteins and nucleic acids.
Step 2: The pattern of the molecule indicates it could interact with proteins that have binding sites for nitrogen-containing molecules, such as receptors and transporters. This structural feature aligns well with the ADRA1D (Adrenergic Receptor Alpha 1D) and ADRA2B (Adrenergic Receptor Alpha 2B) genes, both of which encode G-protein coupled receptors that bind to various ligands including neurotransmitters and hormones.
Step 3: Given the presence of a sulfide group, the molecule might also interact with enzymes that contain thiol groups, such as those involved in detoxification pathways. This suggests a possible interaction with CYP2C19 (Cytochrome P450 2C19), an enzyme involved in drug metabolism, and CYP2D6 (Cytochrome P450 2D6), another key metabolic enzyme.
Step 4: The molecule’s overall structure, particularly its cyclic nature and the presence of nitrogen atoms, could potentially influence signaling pathways mediated by receptors. This aligns with the HTR2A (Serotonin Receptor 2A) and HTR2B (Serotonin Receptor 2B) genes, which are involved in neurotransmission and could be modulated by the molecule.
Step 5: Considering the diverse functional roles of the described genes, the molecule may not directly interact with all listed genes but could have specific interactions with a subset, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A, and HTR2B.
Summary of related gene names:
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
These genes are most likely to be influenced by the molecule due to their involvement in receptor binding, enzymatic activity, and neurotransmission. Other genes may not have direct interactions based on the given molecular structure.
