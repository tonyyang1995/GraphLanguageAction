Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1[n-]cnc(=NS(=O)(=O)c2ccc(N)cc2)c1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring system, which includes a pyrrole ring (indicated by n), a thiophene ring (indicated by S), and an imidazole ring (indicated by c1[n-]c). The presence of these rings suggests that the molecule could interact with proteins that have similar structural motifs or binding sites.
Step 2: The molecule also contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an ester group (-OC(=O)-), which are functional groups known to be involved in various biological interactions such as enzyme inhibition and receptor binding. These functional groups suggest potential interactions with enzymes or receptors that contain similar functional groups.
Step 3: Given the presence of a thiophene ring and a carboxylic acid group, this molecule might interact with enzymes that are involved in metabolism pathways, such as those encoded by CYP (cytochrome P450) genes, including CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These enzymes are known to metabolize a wide range of xenobiotics, and their activity can be influenced by compounds with similar chemical structures.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure might allow it to interact with ion channels, such as those encoded by KCNH2, which is part of the voltage-gated potassium channel family. The presence of charged groups like -[n-] could suggest the molecule may act as a modulator for ion channels.
Step 5: Considering the molecule's complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, it is likely to interact with a variety of receptors and enzymes, potentially affecting the expression or function of genes involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways. Genes such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode serotonin receptors, could be affected due to the molecule's ability to bind to and modulate receptor activity.
