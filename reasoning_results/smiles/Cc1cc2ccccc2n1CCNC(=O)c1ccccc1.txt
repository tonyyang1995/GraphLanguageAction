Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc2ccccc2n1CCNC(=O)c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is often involved in binding to receptors and enzymes. This structural feature suggests potential interactions with genes encoding membrane receptors or metabolic enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a pyridine ring (n1CCNC(=O)c1) indicates possible interactions with enzymes or receptors that have similar functional groups. Pyridine rings are common in ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other drug targets.
Step 3: The overall structure includes multiple aromatic rings and heteroatoms such as nitrogen, which are characteristic of molecules that can modulate receptor activity through agonism or antagonism. This could suggest interactions with genes involved in neurotransmitter signaling pathways.
Step 4: Given the presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH-), this molecule might interact with enzymes that have active sites containing amino acid residues that can form hydrogen bonds or coordinate metal ions, such as certain cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule may be related to genes involved in neurotransmitter signaling and metabolism, specifically: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, PTGS1, and SLC6A4.
