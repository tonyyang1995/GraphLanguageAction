Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)(C)c1nc2c3cc[n-]c(=O)c3c3cc(F)ccc3c2[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a nitrogen atom bearing a negative charge and a carbonyl group. This pattern suggests potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for similar structures, such as receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of fluorine atoms in the molecule indicates it could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, particularly those containing ion channels or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The overall structure includes aromatic rings and heteroatoms, which are common in ligands that bind to nuclear receptors and enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: Given the molecule’s structure, it may interact with genes encoding for enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are involved in the metabolism of various drugs.
Step 5: Additionally, due to its potential to bind to ion channels and GPCRs, the molecule might also interact with genes such as KCNH2, HRH1, and HTR1A, which encode for potassium channels and serotonin receptors.
