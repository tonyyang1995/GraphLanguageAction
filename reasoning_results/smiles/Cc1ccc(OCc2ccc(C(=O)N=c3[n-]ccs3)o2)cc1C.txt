Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(OCc2ccc(C(=O)N=c3[n-]ccs3)o2)cc1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings, including a benzene ring, an oxazole ring, and a pyridine ring. It also contains functional groups such as hydroxyl (-OH), amide (C(=O)N), and sulfoxide (o2). These structural features suggest that the molecule may interact with proteins that have similar chemical functionalities.
Step 2: Among the provided genes, several are known to encode receptors or enzymes that could potentially interact with this type of molecule. For example, genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are involved in neurotransmission, could be relevant due to the presence of amine groups and other polar functional groups in the molecule.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule's structure includes a carboxamide group (C(=O)N) and a sulfoxide group (o2), which are common in substrates for cytochrome P450 enzymes. Genes such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which code for enzymes involved in phase I drug metabolism, might be affected by this molecule through its interaction with these enzymes.
Step 4: Furthermore, the presence of a benzene ring and the overall structure of the molecule suggest potential interactions with membrane-bound proteins, particularly those involved in signal transduction pathways. Genes like PTGS1 (encoding cyclooxygenase-1, COX-1) and SIGMAR1 (encoding sigma receptor 1) could be relevant due to their roles in inflammation and neuronal signaling.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the related genes are likely to be those encoding GPCRs, cytochrome P450 enzymes, membrane-bound proteins involved in signal transduction, and enzymes involved in inflammation and neuronal signaling. The list of related genes is as follows:
- GPCRs: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- Cytochrome P450 enzymes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6
- Membrane-bound proteins: PTGS1, SIGMAR1
- Other: CACNA1H, HRH1, LCK, MCL1, OPKR1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4
These genes play crucial roles in various physiological processes and could be influenced by the described molecule through direct binding or metabolic pathways.
