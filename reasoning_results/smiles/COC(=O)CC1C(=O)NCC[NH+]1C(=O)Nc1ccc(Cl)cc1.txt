Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COC(=O)CC1C(=O)NCC[NH+]1C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring system, amide groups, and a pyrrolidine ring. These structural features suggest potential interactions with proteins involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of amide groups and the overall molecular shape may allow the molecule to interact with receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), cholinergic receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), and dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4). These receptors are known to bind small molecules through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions.
Step 3: The benzene ring system and the presence of chlorine atoms could contribute to interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These enzymes are responsible for metabolizing various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 4: The overall structure might also facilitate binding to ion channels, particularly those involved in calcium signaling, such as CACNA1H and KCNH2. These channels play roles in neuronal excitability and other cellular processes.
Step 5: Given the structural features and potential interaction sites, the molecule could be related to several genes including: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CACNA1H, KCNH2.
