Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [O-]c1cccc([O-])c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains two negatively charged oxygen atoms, represented by [O-], which suggest it may interact with ion channels or receptors that have affinity for negatively charged ligands.
Step 2: The cyclic structure with multiple carbon atoms (c1cccc) indicates potential binding to large protein targets such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The presence of an oxygen atom attached to a carbon chain could indicate a feature that binds to enzymes involved in metabolism, such as CYP enzymes.
Step 4: Given the cyclic nature and the presence of negatively charged groups, the molecule might interact with voltage-gated sodium channels or calcium channels, which are associated with genes like KCNH2.
Step 5: Considering the molecular features, the most likely related genes include those involved in GPCR signaling (e.g., ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), ion channel function (e.g., KCNH2, CACNA1H), and metabolic pathways (e.g., CYP2C19, CYP2D6).
