Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(-c2cc(=O)c3c(OC)c(OC)c(OC)c(OC)c3o2)cc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule with a complex structure that includes a benzene ring (CO), an amide group (-c2cc(=O)), and multiple hydroxyl groups (-c3c(OC)c(OC)c(OC)c(OC)c3). This structure suggests the molecule could have pharmacological activity, potentially interacting with proteins involved in signal transduction or metabolism.
Step 2: Analyzing the structure further, the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) indicates potential for hydrogen bonding and interaction with protein receptors or enzymes. The amide group (-c2cc(=O)) can form peptide bonds, which might interact with proteins containing similar functional groups.
Step 3: Considering the pattern of multiple hydroxyl groups and the amide, this molecule may be able to bind to receptors such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYPs). These types of interactions are common for molecules with similar structures.
Step 4: Given the potential interactions with CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), the molecule could influence the metabolism of drugs through these enzymes, leading to changes in drug efficacy or side effects. Additionally, the structure might also interact with GPCRs, which are involved in various physiological processes (e.g., DRD2, DRD3, HTR2A).
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related genes are primarily those involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and neurotransmitter signaling (DRD2, DRD3, HTR2A). These genes encode proteins that could directly interact with the molecule or be affected by its metabolism.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP1A2
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- DRD2
- DRD3
- HTR2A
Note: The other listed genes do not appear to have a direct structural or functional relationship with the described molecule based on the provided information. However, their involvement could be indirect, such as in pathways influenced by the molecule's effects on metabolism or neurotransmission. For a more comprehensive analysis, additional context about the molecule's biological activity would be necessary.
