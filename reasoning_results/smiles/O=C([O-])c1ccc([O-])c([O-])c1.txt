Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])c1ccc([O-])c([O-])c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a derivative of benzoic acid with multiple oxygen-containing functional groups, including a carboxyl group, an ester, and two phenolic hydroxyl groups. This complex structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes and receptors that are involved in drug metabolism and transport.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxyl group (-COOH) indicates the molecule could be an inhibitor or substrate for enzymes such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are known to metabolize carboxylic acids and similar compounds. Additionally, the molecule's overall size and shape may allow it to interact with various transmembrane proteins and ion channels.
Step 3: The phenolic hydroxyl groups (-OH) in the molecule suggest possible interactions with enzymes like CYP1A2, which metabolizes phenolic compounds, and with receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), where these hydroxyl groups might play a role in binding and activation.
Step 4: Given the molecule's structure, it might also interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are known to bind to various ligands and modulators. The presence of both acidic and basic functional groups could contribute to the molecule's ability to bind to these receptors.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and the described interactions, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C. These genes encode enzymes and receptors that are likely to interact directly or indirectly with the molecule due to its chemical properties. 
Summary of related gene names: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C.
