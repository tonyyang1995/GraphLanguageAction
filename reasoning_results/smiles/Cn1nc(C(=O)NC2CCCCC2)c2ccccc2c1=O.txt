Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cn1nc(C(=O)NC2CCCCC2)c2ccccc2c1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that includes a benzene ring system, a pyrrole ring, an amide group, and a phenolic hydroxyl group. This structure suggests the molecule may interact with receptors or enzymes that are involved in signaling pathways or drug metabolism.
Step 2: Considering the presence of an amide group and a phenolic hydroxyl group, this molecule could potentially act as an agonist or antagonist for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which often have binding sites for peptides and small molecules containing similar functional groups. Therefore, it might be related to genes encoding such receptors.
Step 3: The pattern of the molecule also indicates potential interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly those involved in phase I metabolism, due to the presence of aromatic rings and a carbonyl group. This is relevant to genes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which encode enzymes responsible for metabolizing various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 4: Given the complexity of the molecule and its potential to modulate multiple biological processes through different mechanisms, it is likely to interact with several neurotransmitter receptors, including dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4). These interactions could influence neurotransmission and potentially affect behavior or mood.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule is most likely related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, ESR1, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KDR, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, PTGS1, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4. These genes encode proteins that are either receptors or enzymes that could be directly or indirectly affected by the molecule's structure and chemical properties.
