Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(NC(=O)c2ccc(-c3ccc(-c4noc(C)n4)cc3C)cc2)cc1N1CC[NH+](C)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that includes a number of functional groups such as a carboxamide (-CONH2), amine (-NH2), and aromatic rings. The presence of a carboxamide group suggests that this molecule could be an inhibitor or substrate for enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: Among the listed genes, several are known to encode enzymes involved in drug metabolism, including CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. These cytochrome P450 enzymes are responsible for metabolizing various drugs, and their activity can be influenced by compounds that bind to them.
Step 3: Additionally, some of the genes listed are associated with neurotransmitter receptors or signaling pathways. For example, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C encode serotonin receptors, which are involved in regulating mood and other physiological processes. The molecule’s potential interaction with these receptors would be through direct binding or modulation of receptor function.
Step 4: Furthermore, the presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule indicates it might have basic properties, which could interact with acidic sites on proteins, including ion channels like KCNH2 (hERG potassium channel). This could potentially affect the function of these channels, leading to changes in cellular signaling.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and functional groups present in the molecule, it appears to be most closely related to genes encoding enzymes involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and those involved in neurotransmitter receptor signaling (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C).
