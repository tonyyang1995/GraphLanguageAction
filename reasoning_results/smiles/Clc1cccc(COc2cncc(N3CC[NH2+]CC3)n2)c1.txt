Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Clc1cccc(COc2cncc(N3CC[NH2+]CC3)n2)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule containing multiple functional groups such as a benzene ring, amide, ester, and amines. This structure suggests that the molecule could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, neurotransmission, or drug metabolism.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of an amine group (-NH2) and the overall molecular structure indicate potential interactions with receptors that have similar functional groups, such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) or ion channels. This is relevant to genes encoding for various receptors, including adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), and dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4).
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a benzene ring and a carbonyl group (CO) suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, specifically those encoded by CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). These enzymes are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 4: The molecule also contains a nitro group (-NO2) which might interact with proteins involved in signaling pathways, such as kinases (e.g., LCK, CDK2) and other proteins involved in cellular processes like stress response (e.g., HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2).
Step 5: Considering the above structural features and their potential interactions with various proteins, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, LCK, CDK2, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2.
