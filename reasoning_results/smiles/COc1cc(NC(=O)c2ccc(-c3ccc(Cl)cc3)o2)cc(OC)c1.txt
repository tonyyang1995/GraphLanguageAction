Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule has a complex structure containing a benzene ring, a nitrogen atom with an acetyl group attached, and a pyrrolidine ring. The presence of the nitrogen atom with an acetyl group suggests this molecule could be a derivative of a primary amine, which often serves as a ligand for various receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: Considering the functional groups and the overall structure, this molecule could potentially interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), given its ability to bind to and modulate receptor activity through its amine functionality. This is because many GPCRs have binding sites for small molecules that include amine functionalities.
Step 3: Among the listed genes, several are involved in the expression and function of GPCRs, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes encode for different subtypes of adrenergic and cholinergic receptors and serotonin receptors, respectively.
Step 4: The molecule’s potential to interact with these receptors is further supported by the presence of the acetyl group, which is known to enhance binding affinity to certain types of receptors, particularly those with hydrophobic binding pockets.
Step 5: Given the structure and potential interactions, the related genes are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6. Step 1: The provided molecule has a complex structure containing a benzene ring, a nitrogen atom with an acetyl group attached, and a pyrrolidine ring. The presence of the nitrogen atom with an acetyl group suggests this molecule could be a derivative of a primary amine, which often serves as a ligand for various receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The molecule’s structure indicates it might interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), given its amine functionality, which is a common feature in GPCR ligands.
Step 3: Several genes from the list encode for GPCRs, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 4: The acetyl group in the molecule enhances its potential to bind to hydrophobic sites in GPCRs, supporting interaction with these receptors.
Step 5: Therefore, the related genes are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
