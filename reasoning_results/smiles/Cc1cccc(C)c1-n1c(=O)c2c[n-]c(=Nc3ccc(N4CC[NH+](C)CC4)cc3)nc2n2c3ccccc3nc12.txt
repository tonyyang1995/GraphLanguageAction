Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cccc(C)c1-n1c(=O)c2c[n-]c(=Nc3ccc(N4CC[NH+](C)CC4)cc3)nc2n2c3ccccc3nc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring system with multiple substituents including a nitrogen-containing heterocycle and a carboxamide group. The presence of these functional groups suggests the molecule could interact with proteins that have similar chemical properties.
Step 2: Analyzing the gene list provided, we can identify several neurotransmitter receptors and enzymes that may interact with such a molecule. For instance, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C are serotonin receptors which bind to various ligands and agonists. The molecule’s ability to interact with these receptors is plausible due to its aromatic structure and amide functionality.
Step 3: The molecule also has potential to interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes like CYP2C19 and CYP2D6. These enzymes metabolize numerous drugs, and the molecule’s complex structure might serve as a substrate for these enzymes, affecting their activity and drug metabolism.
Step 4: Given the presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocycle and a carboxamide, the molecule might also interact with adrenergic and cholinergic receptors such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4. These receptors play crucial roles in the body's response to stress and other physiological processes.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4. These genes encode proteins that are likely to interact directly or indirectly with the described molecular structure.
