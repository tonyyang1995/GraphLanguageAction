Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc(C(=O)[O-])c(=O)[n-]c1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring fused to a benzene ring, which is characteristic of molecules that interact with the cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs). This suggests potential interactions with genes encoding these enzymes, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
Step 2: The molecule also has an amide group (-CO-NH-) and a carboxylate group (-COOH), indicating it could be a substrate for enzymes involved in drug metabolism, particularly those encoded by CYP3A4.
Step 3: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) might indicate potential interaction with genes involved in nitric oxide signaling pathways, such as CACNA1H and HRH1.
Step 4: The molecule’s structure includes a quinoline-like moiety, which may suggest possible interactions with genes involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 5: Given the overall structure and functional groups, the molecule is likely to interact with multiple genes involved in neurotransmitter and hormone signaling, including HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, ESR1, PTGS1, and SIGMAR1.
