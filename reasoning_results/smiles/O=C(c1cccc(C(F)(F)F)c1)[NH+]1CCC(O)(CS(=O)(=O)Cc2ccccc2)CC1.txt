Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(c1cccc(C(F)(F)F)c1)[NH+]1CCC(O)(CS(=O)(=O)Cc2ccccc2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring fused to a benzene ring (indicated by "c1cccc(C(F)(F)F)c1") and a carboxamide group (-CONH). This structure is reminiscent of certain ligands that can interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are involved in signal transduction pathways. 
Step 2: The presence of fluoro-substituents (F) on the aromatic ring suggests potential interactions with ion channels or receptors that have hydrophobic binding sites. Fluorine atoms can stabilize certain receptor conformations due to their electronegativity.
Step 3: The presence of a carboxylic acid ester (CS(=O)(=O)Cc2ccccc2) and a cyclic amide (O=C(c1cccc(C(F)(F)F)c1)[NH+]1) could indicate the molecule has pharmacological activity, possibly as an agonist or antagonist for receptors such as adrenergic or cholinergic receptors.
Step 4: Considering the structural features, the molecule might interact with receptors like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, all of which are GPCRs. These receptors are known to be involved in various physiological processes including neurotransmission, hormone signaling, and pain modulation.
Step 5: Therefore, the related gene names are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6. 
Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6. 
These genes encode for G-protein coupled receptors that could potentially interact with the described molecular structure. The exact mechanism would require further experimental validation. Other genes listed do not show direct structural or functional overlap based on the provided information.
