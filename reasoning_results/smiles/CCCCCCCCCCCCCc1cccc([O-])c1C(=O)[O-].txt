Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCCCCCCCCCCc1cccc([O-])c1C(=O)[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups and a carboxyl (-COOH) group, indicating potential for interaction with enzymes that metabolize drugs or hormones.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxyl group suggests possible interaction with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) which often bind to ligands containing hydroxyl or carboxyl functionalities.
Step 3: The molecule's structure is similar to known agonists or antagonists of certain GPCRs, particularly those involved in neurotransmission and hormone signaling.
Step 4: Given the structure, the molecule may interact with receptors such as HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are involved in serotonin signaling.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule might interact with CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Summary of related genes: HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6.
