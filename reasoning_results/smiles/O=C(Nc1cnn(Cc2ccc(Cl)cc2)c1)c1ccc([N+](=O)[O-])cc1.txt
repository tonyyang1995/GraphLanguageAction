Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Nc1cnn(Cc2ccc(Cl)cc2)c1)c1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a nitro group (-NO2), a cyano group (-CN), and a quinoline-like structure. These features are characteristic of certain ligands that can interact with neurotransmitter receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a quinoline-like moiety suggests potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors, which are encoded by genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
Step 3: The molecule also has a pyridine ring and a carboxamide group, which could indicate its potential as a ligand for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) encoded by CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) might suggest the molecule could interact with serotonergic receptors encoded by HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C.
Step 5: The molecule does not show significant structural features that would directly relate it to other listed genes such as ABCB1, CYP enzymes, or PTGS1, among others.
Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C.
