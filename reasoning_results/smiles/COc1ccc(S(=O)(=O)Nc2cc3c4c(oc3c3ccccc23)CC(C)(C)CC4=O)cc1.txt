Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)Nc2cc3c4c(oc3c3ccccc23)CC(C)(C)CC4=O)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure including a benzene ring system, an oxazole group, and a sulfonamide moiety. These structural features suggest potential interactions with enzymes and receptors involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a sulfonamide (S(=O)(=O)N) group indicates that the molecule could be an inhibitor or substrate for enzymes involved in phase II metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize sulfonamides.
Step 3: The benzene ring system and the presence of alkyl chains (e.g., CC(C)(C)CC) suggest possible binding to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Specifically, the molecule might interact with adrenergic (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 4: The overall structure also hints at potential effects on receptors involved in serotonin signaling, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, due to the presence of multiple aromatic rings and alkyl substituents.
Step 5: Given the complex structure and the potential for interactions with enzymes and receptors involved in neurotransmission and metabolism, the related genes include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C. 
Summary of related genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C.
