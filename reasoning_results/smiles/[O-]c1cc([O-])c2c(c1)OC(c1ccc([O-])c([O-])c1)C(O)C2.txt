Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [O-]c1cc([O-])c2c(c1)OC(c1ccc([O-])c([O-])c1)C(O)C2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains several functional groups including hydroxyl (-OH), carbonyl (C=O), and amide (CONH) functionalities. These functional groups are characteristic of small molecule ligands that can interact with various receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The molecule includes a benzene ring system, which is common in many drug molecules due to its planar nature and aromaticity. This structural feature allows for interactions with proteins that have binding sites complementary to such shapes.
Step 3: The presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups suggests the molecule could act as a potential ligand for receptors or enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways, particularly those related to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 4: Given the complexity and specific pattern of the molecule, it is likely to interact with receptors or enzymes that are involved in neurotransmission, hormone action, or signaling pathways. Genes such as DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HRH1 encode for receptors that fit this description.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule's structure might also suggest potential interactions with genes encoding enzymes involved in metabolic pathways, such as CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize drugs and other xenobiotics.
Summary of related gene names: DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HRH1, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4.
