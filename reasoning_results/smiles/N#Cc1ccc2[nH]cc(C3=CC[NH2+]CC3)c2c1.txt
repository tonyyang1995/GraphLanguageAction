Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N#Cc1ccc2[nH]cc(C3=CC[NH2+]CC3)c2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a nitrogen atom double-bonded to a carbon (N#C) and a number of aromatic rings, which are characteristic features of many drugs that interact with receptors or enzymes. This pattern suggests the molecule could be involved in binding to proteins such as receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: Notably, the molecule also includes a pyrrole ring system, which is common in ligands for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are known to be associated with several of the listed genes, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which encode various subtypes of GPCRs.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH2) and a benzene ring could indicate potential interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are responsible for metabolizing many drugs.
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule, particularly its size and functional groups, might suggest it could bind to or inhibit certain kinases, such as CDK2 or LCK, which are encoded by the CDK2 and LCK genes, respectively.
Step 5: Given the detailed structure and potential functional groups, the molecule may have the most direct relevance to genes encoding GPCRs and enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those listed below:
- GPCRs: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C
- Drug Metabolism Enzymes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6
These genes are directly relevant due to their roles in signaling pathways and drug processing. Other genes may have indirect relationships but are not as clearly indicated by the molecule's structure. 
Summary of Related Genes:
- ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6.
