Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(CSc1ccccc1NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(F)cc1)N=c1[n-]nc(C(F)(F)F)s1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a quinoline-like structure with a nitrile and amide group, suggesting potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism such as CYP enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of fluorine atoms (F) indicates possible interactions with transport proteins like SLC6A2 and SLC6A4, which are involved in neurotransmitter reuptake.
Step 3: The molecule includes a benzene ring with substituents, which could interact with receptors such as DRD2, HTR2A, and HTR2B, known to bind to various ligands.
Step 4: The overall structure may also suggest potential binding to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4, due to its aromatic and polar functional groups.
Step 5: The molecule’s complex structure might interact with multiple targets, including CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are involved in phase I metabolism.
