Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)CNS(=O)(=O)c1cc(-c2nn(C)c(=O)c3ccccc23)ccc1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this might be clinically relevant.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is common in many drugs that interact with receptors and transporters involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways. This structural feature may suggest potential interactions with genes encoding proteins involved in these pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH-) indicates the molecule could act as a ligand for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as adrenergic and cholinergic receptors, which are encoded by genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and HTR1A-HTR6. These receptors play key roles in the modulation of neurotransmitter release and neuronal signaling.
Step 3: The molecule also has a nitrile group (-CN), which could indicate potential binding to enzymes or receptors involved in signal transduction cascades, possibly relating to genes such as PTGS1, which encodes cyclooxygenase-1, an enzyme involved in prostaglandin synthesis.
Step 4: The presence of a pyrimidine ring and a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) suggests possible interactions with genes encoding transporters or enzymes that metabolize or transport drugs, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 5: Given the overall structure and functional groups present in the molecule, it is likely to interact with multiple genes involved in neurotransmission, signal transduction, and drug metabolism. The related gene names include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, PTGS1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4. Step 5: Summary of Related Gene Names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, PTGS1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4.
