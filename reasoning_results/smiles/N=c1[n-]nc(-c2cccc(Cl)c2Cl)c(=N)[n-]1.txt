Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N=c1[n-]nc(-c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl)c(=N)[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that contains a nitrile (-CN) group, an amide (N=C), and multiple aromatic rings, indicating a complex organic structure.
Step 2: This type of molecular structure is often involved in interactions with receptors and enzymes that play roles in neurotransmission and drug metabolism. The presence of nitrogen-containing heterocycles and amides suggests potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes involved in the biosynthesis or metabolism of neurotransmitters.
Step 3: Among the listed genes, several are known to encode for GPCRs and enzymes involved in neurotransmitter signaling and metabolism. These include HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, and CYP2D6. The molecule's structure could potentially interact with these receptors and enzymes.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule might interact with enzymes such as CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs and endogenous compounds.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes are: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4.
