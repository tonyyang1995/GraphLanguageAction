Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cncc(C[NH+]2CCC(=C3c4ccc(Cl)cc4CCc4cccnc43)CC2)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is common in many drug-like molecules. This structural feature is often involved in binding to protein targets, including receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a pyrrole ring, which is another common component in pharmaceuticals due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds and participate in aromatic interactions. Pyrroles are known to interact with various receptors and enzymes.
Step 3: The presence of a quinoline-like moiety (a benzene ring fused to a pyridine ring) suggests potential interactions with ion channels and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), as these classes of proteins often bind to similar structural motifs.
Step 4: Given the structural complexity and the presence of functional groups like amide, ester, and possibly aromatic nitrogen, this molecule could potentially modulate multiple targets, including enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, as well as receptors like DRD2, HTR2A, and HTR2B, which are involved in neurotransmission.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule may be related to the following genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP3A4
- DRD2
- HTR2A
- HTR2B Step 1: The given molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is common in many drug-like molecules. This structural feature is often involved in binding to protein targets, including receptors and enzymes.
- HTR2B
The molecule likely interacts with several genes involved in metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4) and neurotransmission (DRD2
