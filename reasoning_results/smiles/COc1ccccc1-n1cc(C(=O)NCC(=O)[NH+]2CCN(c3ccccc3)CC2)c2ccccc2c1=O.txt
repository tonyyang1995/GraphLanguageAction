Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccccc1-n1cc(C(=O)NCC(=O)[NH+]2CCN(c3ccccc3)CC2)c2ccccc2c1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing aromatic rings, amine groups, and a carboxyl group. The presence of aromatic rings suggests potential interactions with proteins that have hydrophobic binding sites, such as certain receptors or transporters.
Step 2: The amine group (-NH2) and carboxyl group (-COOH) are functional groups that can participate in hydrogen bonding and other types of molecular interactions, which may influence the binding affinity of the molecule to proteins involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 3: Considering the structure, the molecule might interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are known to have seven transmembrane domains and often bind ligands with similar functional groups. Specifically, it could potentially interact with adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 4: Additionally, due to its chemical nature, the molecule might also interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). These enzymes are crucial for the metabolism of many drugs, and their interaction could affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the molecule.
Step 5: Furthermore, the molecule could interact with ion channels, such as voltage-gated calcium channels (CACNA1H) and potassium channels (KCNH2), given the presence of hydrophobic and polar regions that could fit into the channel's selectivity filter or binding pocket.
