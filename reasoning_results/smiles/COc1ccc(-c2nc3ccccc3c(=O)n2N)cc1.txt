Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(-c2nc3ccccc3c(=O)n2N)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that contains a benzene ring with multiple functional groups attached, including a nitrile group (-C#N), an amide group (-CONH2), and a cyano group (-CN). This complex structure suggests that the molecule could be involved in interactions with proteins that have binding sites for aromatic compounds or functional groups such as amides or nitriles.
Step 2: Among the listed genes, several are known to encode receptors or enzymes that interact with aromatic compounds or specific functional groups. For example, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 are cytochrome P450 enzymes that metabolize various substrates, including aromatic compounds. Similarly, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4 encode dopamine receptors, which can bind to aromatic ligands.
Step 3: The presence of an amide group in the molecule might also suggest a potential interaction with genes encoding ion channels or neurotransmitter transporters, such as SLC6A2 (norepinephrine transporter) and SLC6A4 (serotonin transporter). These genes are involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter levels, and their proteins often have binding sites for amide-containing molecules.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure could potentially interact with genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are involved in the regulation of various physiological processes through serotonin signaling. The amide and nitrile groups might serve as potential ligands for these receptors.
Step 5: Lastly, the molecule's complex structure may also interact with genes encoding kinases, such as CDK2, which is involved in cell cycle regulation, or LCK, a tyrosine kinase that plays a role in T-cell activation. These kinases may have binding sites for aromatic compounds or functional groups like amides.
