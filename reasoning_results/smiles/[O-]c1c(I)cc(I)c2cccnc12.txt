Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [O-]c1c(I)cc(I)c2cccnc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that contains an oxygen atom with a negative charge (-) bonded to a benzene ring, which is substituted with an isopropyl group (I). This structure suggests the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors that interact with similar functional groups.
Step 2: The pattern of having a negatively charged oxygen atom attached to a benzene ring with substituents like isopropyl groups is commonly found in molecules that interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly those involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways.
Step 3: Given the presence of substituents and the overall structure, this molecule may have a high likelihood of interacting with receptors such as dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) and serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), which are known to have similar functional groups and binding sites for ligands.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a benzene ring with a negative charge might suggest potential interactions with ion channels or transporters, such as the potassium channel KCNH2, which could influence its pharmacological profile.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes include: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and KCNH2.
Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2
- DRD3
- DRD4
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- HTR6
- KCNH2 Step 5: Summary of related gene names:
- KCNH2
These genes encode proteins that are directly or indirectly influenced by the described molecule due to their structural and functional similarities with the molecule's pattern.
