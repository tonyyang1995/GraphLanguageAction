Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCN(CCCC)c1nc(OC)nc(-n2nnc(C(C)=O)c2C)n1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure featuring multiple rings, including a benzene ring and a pyrrolidine ring, connected by alkyl chains. The presence of a benzene ring suggests that this molecule may interact with proteins involved in signal transduction or metabolism, which are often associated with aromatic amino acids or nucleic acid binding.
Step 2: The molecule also contains an amide group (-CONH-) and an ester group (-COOR), which can form hydrogen bonds and participate in hydrophobic interactions. These functional groups are common in ligands that bind to receptors and enzymes, suggesting potential interactions with genes encoding for such proteins.
Step 3: The molecule includes a cyclic structure with a nitrogen atom, which could indicate the possibility of interacting with ion channels or neurotransmitter receptors, as these often contain similar structural motifs. For example, the cyclic structure might suggest potential interactions with genes like HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A), HTR2B (serotonin receptor 2B), or HTR2C (serotonin receptor 2C).
Step 4: Given the complexity and specific functional groups present, the molecule might also interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP3A4. These enzymes are known to metabolize various drugs, and their activity can be influenced by small molecules with similar structures.
Step 5: Considering the potential interactions with neurotransmitter receptors and enzymes involved in drug metabolism, the related genes are likely to include HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4.
Summary of related gene names:
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
