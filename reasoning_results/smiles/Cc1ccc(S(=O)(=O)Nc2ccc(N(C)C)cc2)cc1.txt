Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)Nc2ccc(N(C)C)cc2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a benzodiazepine derivative, characterized by a benzene ring fused to a diazepine ring, with an additional sulfonyl group (-SO2-) attached to the nitrogen atom of the diazepine ring. This structure is indicative of molecules that can interact with GABA-A receptors, particularly those containing the benzodiazepine binding site.
Step 2: The presence of a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) suggests the molecule may have increased potency or selectivity for certain receptor subtypes due to its ability to form strong hydrogen bonds, which could enhance its interaction with specific receptor sites.
Step 3: The substitution of a nitrogen atom within the diazepine ring with a sulfur-containing group (sulfoxide) indicates potential for enhanced pharmacological activity, possibly through increased stability or altered binding affinity compared to the parent compound without this modification.
Step 4: Considering the pharmacological profile of benzodiazepine derivatives, this molecule likely interacts with GABA-A receptors, which are known to be modulated by various neurotransmitters and drugs including benzodiazepines. These receptors are involved in several neurological processes and are associated with multiple genes listed.
Step 5: Given the interaction with GABA-A receptors, the related genes include those encoding components of the GABAergic system such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, and CNR1. Additionally, genes involved in metabolism and signaling pathways that may be affected by benzodiazepine action, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, are also relevant.
