Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(c1ccccn1)[NH+](Cc1ccco1)C1(C(=O)Nc2ccc(Br)cc2)CCCCC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a quinoline-like structure with a nitrogen atom that carries a positive charge. This indicates potential interactions with proteins that have ion channel or receptor functions.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring with an attached cyano group (CN) suggests possible binding to enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP enzymes.
Step 3: The molecule also has a thiazole moiety, which could interact with receptors like GABA receptors (e.g., GABRA1, GABRB1), though it is not directly present in the given genes.
Step 4: Given the presence of multiple functional groups and aromatic rings, the molecule might interact with enzymes or receptors involved in signal transduction pathways, such as those encoded by DRD2, HTR1A, and HTR2A.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and potential interactions, the most likely related genes are CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and DRD2.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- DRD2 Step 1: The molecule contains a quinoline-like structure with a nitrogen atom that carries a positive charge. This indicates potential interactions with proteins that have ion channel or receptor functions.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a thiazole moiety, which could interact with receptors like GABA receptors (though not directly present in the given genes).
Step 4: Given its complex structure with multiple functional groups and aromatic rings, the molecule may interact with enzymes or receptors involved in signal transduction pathways, such as DRD2 and HTR series genes.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure, the most likely related genes are CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and DRD2.
- DRD2
Note: The HTR series genes (HTR1A, HTR2A, etc.) are included in the reasoning but are not listed in the final summary due to their absence from the provided gene list. The focus remains on the most relevant genes based on the molecule's structure.
