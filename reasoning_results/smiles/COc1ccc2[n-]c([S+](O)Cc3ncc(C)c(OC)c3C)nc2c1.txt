Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc2[n-]c([S+](O)Cc3ncc(C)c(OC)c3C)nc2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this relationship is significant.
Step 1: The molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) which is characteristic of drugs that interact with certain receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a pyridine ring suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19.
Step 3: The nitrogen atom in the molecule's structure could form a part of a binding site for receptors like DRD2, HTR2A, and HTR2B, which are known to have amine-containing ligands.
Step 4: The overall structure indicates possible interactions with ion channels and transporters, particularly those related to the calcium channel subunit CACNA1H and the adrenergic receptors ADRA1D and ADRB2.
Step 5: Given the structural features, the molecule may be related to the genes CYP2C9, CYP2C19, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, CACNA1H, ADRA1D, and ADRB2.
Summary of related genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, CACNA1H, ADRA1D, ADRB2. Step 1: The molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) which is characteristic of drugs that interact with certain receptors and enzymes.
Summary of related genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, CACNA1H, ADRA1D, ADRB2. Step 1: The molecule has a sulfonamide group, indicating potential interactions with enzymes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a pyridine ring points towards possible interactions with CYP2C9 and CYP2C19.
Step 3: The nitrogen-containing structure suggests it might bind to receptors such as DRD2, HTR2A, and HTR2B.
Step 4: The molecule’s structure also hints at interactions with ion channels and transporters, including CACNA1H, ADRA1D, and ADRB2.
