Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C#CC[NH+](C)CCCOc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is a common feature in many drug molecules. This pattern suggests that the molecule might interact with proteins involved in signal transduction or receptor binding.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrile group (C#N) indicates the potential for interaction with enzymes such as cytochrome P450s (CYPs), particularly CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are known to metabolize nitriles into more reactive species.
Step 3: The amide group (-NH-) and the presence of a positively charged nitrogen atom suggest that the molecule could bind to receptors or ion channels. Specifically, this pattern is relevant to genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 4: The presence of a chloroalkane chain (Cl-CH2-CH2-Cl) and a carboxylic acid group (COOH) indicate that the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or transporters. Genes like CYP3A4, CYP2D6, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4 are relevant here, as they encode enzymes involved in drug metabolism and transporters that might interact with the molecule.
Step 5: The overall structure, with its aromatic rings, amine, and polar functional groups, suggests that the molecule could interact with multiple targets, including kinases (e.g., CDK2, LCK), receptors (e.g., HRH1, KDR), and other proteins involved in signal transduction pathways. This complexity points towards a broader range of potential gene interactions.
