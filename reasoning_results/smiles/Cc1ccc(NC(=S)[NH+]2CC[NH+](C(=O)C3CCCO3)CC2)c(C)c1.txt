Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(NC(=S)[NH+]2CC[NH+](C(=O)C3CCCO3)CC2)c(C)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (N+), which is part of an amide group (C(=O)C3CCCO3). This suggests the molecule may interact with proteins that have positively charged binding sites or that contain histidine residues, which are known to form salt bridges with positively charged groups.
Step 2: The presence of sulfur-containing heterocycles (e.g., NCS) indicates potential for interaction with proteins containing cysteine residues, which can form disulfide bonds or participate in hydrogen bonding.
Step 3: The aromatic rings (e.g., benzene rings) suggest the molecule could bind to proteins with hydrophobic pockets or that contain aromatic amino acids like tyrosine or phenylalanine.
Step 4: The overall structure includes a quinolone-like moiety, which is often recognized by enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4.
Step 5: Given the complexity and functional groups present, this molecule is likely to interact with a range of proteins involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction, including G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like DRD2, HTR1A, and HRH1, and enzymes involved in receptor signaling pathways, such as PTGS1.
