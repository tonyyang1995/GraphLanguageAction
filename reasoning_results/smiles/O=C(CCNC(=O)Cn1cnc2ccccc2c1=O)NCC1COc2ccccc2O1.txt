Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(CCNC(=O)Cn1cnc2ccccc2c1=O)NCC1COc2ccccc2O1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with a carbonyl group and an amide moiety. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and amide group indicates possible binding to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are often targets for drugs due to their role in signal transduction pathways.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a quinoline-like structure, which could interact with ion channels, particularly those involved in neurotransmission.
Step 4: Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, the molecule may influence multiple signaling pathways and could be related to several genes involved in these pathways.
Step 5: Genes related to this molecule include CYP2D6, CYP2C19, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are involved in the metabolism and function of serotonin and other neurotransmitters.
