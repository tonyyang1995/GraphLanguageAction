Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCc1cccc2c3c([nH]c12)C(CC)(CC(=O)[O-])OCC3, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this relationship is significant.
Step 1: The molecule contains a tricyclic core structure, which is often found in drugs that interact with receptors such as adrenergic (alpha and beta) and muscarinic cholinergic receptors.
Step 2: The molecule also has a quinoline ring, which is characteristic of compounds that may interact with enzymes like CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The presence of a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group suggests potential interaction with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and may affect the function of genes encoding these receptors, such as HTR2A and HTR2B.
Step 4: The overall structure includes features that could interact with multiple receptor types, indicating the molecule might have a broad pharmacological profile affecting several genes involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways.
Step 5: Based on the structural features, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR6.
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR6
