Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Cc1ccccc1Cl)NC1CC[NH+](Cc2ccccc2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this might be clinically relevant.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with a chloro substituent (Cl) attached to one of the rings. This pattern is characteristic of several drugs that interact with the cytochrome P450 enzymes, specifically CYP2D6 and CYP2C19. These enzymes are involved in the metabolism of various drugs, including those that modulate neurotransmitters and receptors.
Step 2: The molecule also has a pyrrole ring fused to the benzene ring system. Pyrrole rings are common in compounds that can act as ligands for various receptors, such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Among the provided genes, several are known to encode GPCRs, including DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are dopamine receptors, and HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are serotonin receptors.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule includes a pyridine ring, which is a common motif in drugs that interact with ion channels. Specifically, the presence of a pyridine ring suggests potential interaction with voltage-gated sodium channels encoded by SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN3A, SCN8A, and SCN9A, although these genes are not present in the given list.
Step 4: The molecule also has a quinoline ring system, which can interact with certain enzymes and transporters. Among the listed genes, CYP3A4 is an enzyme that metabolizes many drugs, and SLC6A4 encodes the noradrenaline transporter, which is involved in the reuptake of norepinephrine.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to have interactions with the following genes: CYP2D6, CYP2C19, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CYP3A4, and SLC6A4.
Summary of related genes: CYP2D6, CYP2C19, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CYP3A4, SLC6A4. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with a chloro substituent (Cl), which is a feature found in some substrates for the cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2D6 and CYP2C19.
Step 2: The presence of a pyrrole ring fused to the benzene ring suggests potential interaction with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), as seen in DRD2, DRD3, DRD4 (dopamine receptors) and HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C (serotonin receptors).
Step 3: The pyridine ring in the molecule indicates possible interaction with ion channels, though none of the listed genes directly correspond to this feature.
Step 4: The quinoline ring system could interact with enzymes like CYP3A4, which is mentioned in the list, and transporters such as SLC6A4, which encodes the noradrenaline transporter.
Step 5: Based
