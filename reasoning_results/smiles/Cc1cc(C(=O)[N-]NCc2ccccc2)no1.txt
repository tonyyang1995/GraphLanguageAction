Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc(C(=O)[N-]NCc2ccccc2)no1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure that includes a benzene ring with an acetyl group attached, a nitrogen atom with a negative charge, and a nitro group (-NO2). This pattern suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism and signaling pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen with a negative charge (N-) indicates the molecule could be an inhibitor or substrate for enzymes that handle charged species, such as certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP) and drug transporters like P-glycoprotein encoded by ABCB1. These enzymes are crucial in drug metabolism and transport.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a phenyl ring, which is a common feature in many drugs and can interact with receptors such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Notably, it matches the structural features of some ligands for adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B).
Step 4: Given the presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH-), this molecule might interact with proteins that have catalytic activity, such as kinases. For example, CDK2 (cyclin-dependent kinase 2) is a target for compounds with similar structures.
Step 5: The nitro group (-NO2) can act as a modulator of various enzymes and signaling pathways. It is known to influence the activity of enzymes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are involved in the metabolism of numerous drugs.
