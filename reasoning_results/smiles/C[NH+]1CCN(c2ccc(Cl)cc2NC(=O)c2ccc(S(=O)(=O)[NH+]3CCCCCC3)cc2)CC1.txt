Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+]1CCN(c2ccc(Cl)cc2NC(=O)c2ccc(S(=O)(=O)[NH+]3CCCCCC3)cc2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring with a positively charged nitrogen atom, which suggests it may interact with ion channels or receptors that have similar functional groups. This is a common feature for molecules that interact with neurotransmitter receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring with substituents such as chlorine and sulfonyl groups indicates potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism. This is due to the hydrophobic and polar characteristics of these groups.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a quinoline ring, which is known to be involved in interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are often targets for drugs affecting neurotransmission.
Step 4: Given the presence of amide and carboxylic acid functionalities, this molecule might also interact with enzymes like CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs.
Step 5: Based on the structural features identified, the molecule could potentially be related to several genes involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
