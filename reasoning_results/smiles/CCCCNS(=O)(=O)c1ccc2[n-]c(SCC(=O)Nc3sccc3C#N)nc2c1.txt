Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCNS(=O)(=O)c1ccc2[n-]c(SCC(=O)Nc3sccc3C#N)nc2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex molecule that includes a number of functional groups such as a benzene ring, an amide group (-CONH), a sulfonamide group (NS(=O)(=O)), a nitrile group (-CN), and a thioether group (-SC). These structural features suggest the molecule could interact with proteins involved in various biological processes.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of an amide and a sulfonamide group indicates the molecule may act as an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes. Specifically, it might target enzymes that contain catalytic sites for amide or sulfonamide binding, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP enzymes).
Step 3: The thioether group and the nitrile group are less common in typical enzyme inhibition but can be part of pharmacophores that interact with specific protein targets. For instance, they could be involved in interactions with receptors or transporters that have hydrophobic or electrophilic pockets.
Step 4: Given the potential for this molecule to interact with CYP enzymes, it is likely to affect the metabolism of other drugs and chemicals, which could influence the activity of several genes associated with drug metabolism and response. This includes CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.
Step 5: Additionally, due to the presence of a benzene ring and a nitrile group, the molecule might also interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which often bind to small molecules. This could potentially affect the activity of genes encoding GPCRs like DRD2, HTR2A, and HRH1, among others.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP1A2
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- DRD2
- HTR2A
- HRH1
These genes are relevant based on the structural features of the molecule and their known roles in metabolism and signaling pathways.
