Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NS(=O)(=O)c1cc2c(cc1Cl)[NH+]=CNS2(=O)=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a nitroimidazole derivative, characterized by the presence of a nitro group (-NO2) and an imidazole ring. This structure is typically associated with antifungal and anticancer drugs, such as metronidazole. The presence of a positively charged nitrogen (N+) suggests it may be protonated in physiological conditions.
Step 2: The nitroimidazole core interacts with DNA, particularly targeting DNA topoisomerases II (TOP2), which are involved in DNA replication and repair. TOP2 inhibition leads to DNA strand breaks, causing cell death. This mechanism of action is relevant to genes involved in DNA processing and repair.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a sulfonamide moiety (-SO2NH2), which is commonly found in drugs that inhibit dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). DHFR inhibitors are used in the treatment of malaria and some cancers. This feature is linked to genes like CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are involved in drug metabolism and transport.
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule suggests potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to its size and functional groups. GPCRs are involved in various signaling pathways and are targets for many therapeutic agents. This could be relevant to genes such as DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, and HRH1, which encode for dopamine D2 receptor, serotonin 5-HT1A receptor, serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, and histamine H1 receptor, respectively.
Step 5: The molecule’s structure also indicates potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs). This is relevant to genes like CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19, which are known to metabolize various drugs.
Summary of related gene names: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HRH1.
