Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCC[NH+](CCC)S(=O)(=O)c1ccc(C(=O)[O-])cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains several functional groups and rings that are common in drug-like molecules, such as an amide (N-C=O), a sulfoxide (S=O), and aromatic rings (cyclohexane). These features suggest the molecule could interact with proteins involved in cellular signaling pathways.
Step 2: The presence of an ester group (C(=O)[O-]) and a carboxylic acid (COOH) indicates potential for binding to receptors that recognize acidic or ester-containing ligands, such as certain G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The overall structure includes a benzene ring system, which is often found in ligands for cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, due to the ability of these enzymes to oxidize aromatic substrates.
Step 4: The molecule also possesses a quaternary ammonium group (NH+) which may be relevant for interactions with ion channels like KCNH2, which is encoded by the KCNQ2 gene, though this is less likely given the other structural elements.
Step 5: Considering the above structural features, the molecule is most likely to have a relationship with genes involved in drug metabolism (e.g., CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and signal transduction pathways involving GPCRs (e.g., HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Summary of related gene names: CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4. Step 1: The molecule contains several functional groups and rings that are common in drug-like molecules, such as an amide (N-C=O), a sulfoxide (S=O), and aromatic rings (cyclohexane). These features suggest the molecule could interact with proteins involved in cellular signaling pathways.
Step 4: The molecule also possesses a quaternary ammonium group (NH+) which may be relevant for interactions with ion channels like KCNH2, though this is less likely given the other structural elements.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure, the most likely related genes are those involved in drug metabolism (CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and neurotransmission (HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Summary of related gene names: CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4.
