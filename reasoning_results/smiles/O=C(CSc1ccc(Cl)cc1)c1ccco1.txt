Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(CSc1ccc(Cl)cc1)c1ccco1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound with a structure that includes a benzene ring (C6H6) connected to a cyano group (-CN), a chlorine atom (Cl), and several other functional groups such as a carboxyl group (-COOH), an alcohol group (-OH), and a methyl group (-CH3). This structure suggests it could interact with proteins involved in drug metabolism or transport.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group and a carboxyl group indicates potential for binding to proteins that have these functional groups as ligands, such as enzymes involved in phase II metabolism (e.g., glutathione S-transferases, UDP-glucuronosyltransferases) or ion channels (e.g., KCNH2, which encodes the hERG potassium channel).
Step 3: The molecule’s aromatic structure (benzene ring) and chlorine substituent might also suggest interactions with proteins that recognize aromatic amino acids or halogenated compounds, like CYP enzymes (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs.
Step 4: Given the presence of a carboxylic acid group, the molecule could potentially bind to receptors that recognize acidic ligands, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) involved in neurotransmission, including HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6 (serotonin receptors), and DRD2, DRD3, DRD4 (dopamine receptors).
Step 5: Considering the overall structure, the molecule could be involved in modulating signal transduction pathways, which may relate to genes such as PTGS1 (COX-1/2), which encode cyclooxygenase enzymes involved in inflammation and pain, and OPRL1 (Opioid receptor mu-like 1), which encodes a receptor for endogenous opioids.
