Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NC(=O)C[NH+]1CCCC1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule with a core structure that includes a benzene ring attached to an amide group (-CONH-). This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism, as many drug molecules target enzymes such as cytochrome P450s (CYPs), which are encoded by genes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group and a benzene ring also indicates the molecule could be an agonist or antagonist for receptors, particularly G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are encoded by genes such as DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are involved in neurotransmitter signaling.
Step 3: The aromatic nature of the benzene ring suggests the molecule may interact with ion channels, such as KCNH2, which encodes a potassium channel, or LCK, which is involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 4: Given the complexity and potential for multiple binding sites, the molecule might not specifically relate to just one gene but rather to several genes associated with different biological functions including metabolism, receptor signaling, and ion channel activity.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, and LCK.
