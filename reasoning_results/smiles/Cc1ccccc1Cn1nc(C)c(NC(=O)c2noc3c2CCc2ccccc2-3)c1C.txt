Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccccc1Cn1nc(C)c(NC(=O)c2noc3c2CCc2ccccc2-3)c1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is a common feature in many drug molecules. This structure is often involved in binding to various receptors and enzymes, suggesting potential interactions with multiple genes.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrile group (CN) within the molecule is notable. Nitriles are known to interact with certain enzymes, particularly those involved in phase I metabolism such as cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs). This indicates that the molecule could potentially affect the expression or activity of genes encoding for CYP enzymes, specifically CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a carboxamide group (-CONH2), which is another functional group commonly found in drugs that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels. This suggests possible interactions with genes encoding for receptors and channels, such as DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A), and KCNH2 (potassium channel subfamily H member 2).
Step 4: Given the overall complexity and specific functional groups present in the molecule, it is likely to interact with multiple genes involved in drug metabolism and signaling pathways. However, based on the identified functional groups, the most probable interactions would be with genes related to CYP enzymes, GPCRs, and potassium channels.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the molecule is most likely to be related to the following genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A, and KCNH2.
Related gene names: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A, KCNH2.
