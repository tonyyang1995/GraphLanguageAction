Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCOc1ccc2ccc(=O)oc2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string CCCCOc1ccc2ccc(=O)oc2c1 appears to be a complex organic compound containing multiple functional groups such as carbonyl (C=O), aromatic rings, and hydroxyl (-OH). This structure suggests it could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: Given the presence of a carbonyl group and aromatic rings, this molecule likely interacts with proteins that have binding sites for such structures, potentially affecting their function. For example, it might inhibit enzymes like CYP2D6, which is known to metabolize drugs and other xenobiotics through oxidation reactions involving a carbonyl group.
Step 3: The aromatic rings in the molecule could also interact with receptors that bind to ligands with similar structures, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This interaction could affect the activity of receptors like DRD2 (Dopamine D2 receptor) and HTR2A (Serotonin 5-HT2A receptor), which are known to have binding sites for various ligands including those with aromatic structures.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a hydroxyl group (-OH) might enable the molecule to act as a ligand for esterases or other hydrolases, potentially affecting enzymes like CYP2C19, which is involved in the metabolism of several drugs and endogenous compounds.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related genes include: CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A, CYP2C19, and possibly others that have binding sites for similar chemical structures. These genes encode enzymes and receptors that are directly influenced by the molecule's structure.
Summary of Related Genes: CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A, CYP2C19.
