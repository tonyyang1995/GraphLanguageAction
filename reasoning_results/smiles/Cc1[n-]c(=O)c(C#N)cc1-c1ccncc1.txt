Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1[n-]c(=O)c(C#N)cc1-c1ccncc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a negative charge (-) attached to a benzene ring, indicating it may interact with receptors that have affinity for negatively charged groups.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group (CN) suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolic pathways, such as those encoded by CYP2D6.
Step 3: The presence of a nitrile group (C#N) could indicate interactions with enzymes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are known to metabolize nitriles.
Step 4: The aromatic structure and functional groups suggest possible interactions with receptors and ion channels, including those encoded by ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, and KCNH2.
Step 5: The overall structure hints at potential effects on neurotransmitter systems, possibly involving genes like HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C.
Summary of Related Genes: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, KCNH2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C Step 5: The summary lists the related genes based on the molecule's structural features and potential interactions. These genes include those involved in metabolism (CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19), receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C), and ion channels (KCNH2).
