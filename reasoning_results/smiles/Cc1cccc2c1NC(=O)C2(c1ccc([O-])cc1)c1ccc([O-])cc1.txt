Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cccc2c1NC(=O)C2(c1ccc([O-])cc1)c1ccc([O-])cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with an amide group (N=C=O) attached to it, which suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in neurotransmission and receptor binding. This structural feature is indicative of molecules that can modulate the activity of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other receptors that are involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of multiple aromatic rings and a carboxylate group (-COO-) could indicate the molecule has acidic properties and might interact with proteins that have ion channels or transporters, such as those encoded by the SLC6A family, which includes neurotransmitter transporters like SLC6A2 and SLC6A4.
Step 3: The amide functionality and overall chemical structure suggest the molecule may have affinity for receptors or enzymes that are known targets for drugs, including some of the listed genes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which encode cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: Given the presence of a nitrogen atom potentially capable of forming hydrogen bonds and the overall structure, the molecule might interact with proteins that have GPCR-like structures, such as DRD2 (Dopamine Receptor D2), HTR2A (Serotonin Receptor 5-HT2A), and HTR2B (Serotonin Receptor 5-HT2B), which are involved in various signaling pathways.
Step 5: Considering the structural complexity and the potential for interaction with multiple protein families, the molecule could be related to several of the listed genes, including but not limited to: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, DRD2, HTR2A, and HTR2B. 
Summary of Related Genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B.
