Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc2c(Oc3ccc4[nH]c(C)cc4c3F)ncnc2cc1OCCC[NH+]1CCCC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a complex structure including an aromatic ring system, a pyridine ring, and several functional groups such as hydroxyl (-OH), amide (-CONH-), and amine (-NH2). This structure suggests that the molecule may interact with proteins that have similar chemical features.
Step 2: The presence of a hydroxyl group and amide groups in the molecule indicates potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These enzymes are responsible for metabolizing various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: The aromatic ring system and the presence of fluorine (F) atoms suggest possible interactions with ion channels, particularly voltage-gated calcium channels. The gene CACNA1H encodes a subunit of a voltage-gated calcium channel, which could be influenced by this molecule.
Step 4: The amine group in the molecule might interact with receptors that have an amine binding site, such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B) and dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4). These receptors play crucial roles in neurotransmission and could be affected by the molecule.
Step 5: The overall structure of the molecule also hints at potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to its size and complexity, which could include serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Summary of related gene names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CACNA1H, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4.
