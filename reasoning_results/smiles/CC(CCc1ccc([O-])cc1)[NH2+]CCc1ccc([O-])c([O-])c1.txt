Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(CCc1ccc([O-])cc1)[NH2+]CCc1ccc([O-])c([O-])c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with multiple substituents including an amine group, a carboxylate group, and other functional groups such as alkyl chains and hydroxyl groups. This complex structure suggests that it may interact with proteins involved in signal transduction, receptor binding, and enzymatic activity.
Step 2: The presence of an amine group (NH2+) and carboxylate groups (-[O-]) indicates potential for interactions with ion channels, receptors, and transporters. Specifically, these functional groups could form hydrogen bonds or ionic interactions with proteins.
Step 3: The benzene rings and alkyl chains suggest the molecule might be capable of interacting with proteins involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways, such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 4: The carboxylate groups and overall polarity of the molecule hint at possible interactions with enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 5: Given the complexity and specific functional groups present, the molecule may also interact with receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and hormone signaling, such as DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and ESR1.
