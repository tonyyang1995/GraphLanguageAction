Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCC[NH+](CCCC)CCCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains multiple aromatic rings, specifically benzene rings, which are common in many drugs that interact with receptors and enzymes. This structure suggests potential interactions with genes involved in receptor signaling and drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a pyrrolidine ring and an amide group indicates possible interactions with genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes like CYP2D6 and CYP2C9, which metabolize many drugs including those that bind to GPCRs.
Step 3: The molecule's overall structure, including the presence of an amine group and an ester group, points towards potential interactions with genes involved in neurotransmitter systems, such as DRD2, HTR1A, and SLC6A4, which encode proteins that regulate dopamine and serotonin signaling.
Step 4: The aromatic heterocycles and amide functionalities suggest the molecule could be a ligand for enzymes involved in phase I metabolism, such as CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, which are encoded by the respective genes.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and functional groups, the molecule is likely to interact with the following genes: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR1A, SLC6A4, and possibly others involved in receptor signaling and metabolism. Step 5: Summary of related gene names: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR1A, SLC6A4.
