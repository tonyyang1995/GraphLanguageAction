Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC[NH+]1CCC(n2cc(CNc3cc(Cl)c4[n-]cc(C#N)c(=Nc5ccc(F)c(Cl)c5)c4c3)nn2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other type of explanation.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (NH+), indicating it could be an amine derivative or a similar functional group. This feature might interact with receptors that bind amine compounds, such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 2: The molecule also includes a cyano group (-CN) and a nitrile group (C#N), which are often involved in interactions with enzymes like CYP2D6 and CYP2C9, known for their role in metabolizing drugs containing these groups.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of multiple aromatic rings and heteroatoms (such as nitrogen and chlorine) suggests potential binding to proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, such as G-protein coupled receptors (e.g., HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C) and ion channels (e.g., KCNH2).
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule, with its complex aromatic system and potential for hydrogen bonding due to the amine group, may influence its affinity for nuclear receptors like PPARγ (PPARG) and estrogen receptors (ESR1), which are known to bind ligands with similar chemical properties.
Step 5: Considering the above structural features, the molecule could potentially interact with several genes involved in neurotransmission, drug metabolism, and cellular signaling, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, PPARG, and ESR1. 
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, PPARG, ESR1.
