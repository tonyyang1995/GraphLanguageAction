Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH2+]CCC(Oc1cccc2ccccc12)c1cccs1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring and an amide group (-NH2), which are common structural elements in ligands for receptors like adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B) and cholinergic receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4). These receptors often interact with molecules that contain basic amino groups.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and alkyl chains suggests potential interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which metabolize many drugs and xenobiotics, including those with aromatic structures and hydrophobic side chains.
Step 3: The molecule's overall structure, including its amine and ester functionalities, could potentially interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) and serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Step 4: The cyclic structure and amide linkage might also suggest a potential interaction with voltage-gated sodium channels (CACNA1H), given the presence of similar functional groups in channel blockers.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure, it is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and CACNA1H. Step 5: Related Gene List: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CACNA1H.
