Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc2c(Cl)c(C(=O)N=c3cc(C)o[n-]3)sc2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule, which includes a benzene ring system, a pyrrole ring, and a pyridine ring, along with various functional groups such as amide, ester, and chlorine substituents. The presence of these structural elements suggests that the molecule could be a pharmaceutical compound designed to interact with specific receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The molecule's structure contains a pyrrole ring attached to a benzene ring, which is a common motif found in many drugs that target G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature indicates potential interaction with GPCRs, which are encoded by several of the listed genes, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, and ADRB2.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule has an amide group and a carboxamide group, which are known to participate in hydrogen bonding and other interactions with protein targets. These functional groups suggest that the molecule might interact with enzymes, such as those encoded by CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: The presence of a chlorine atom (-Cl) in the molecule could indicate a stabilizing effect through halogen bonding, which might influence the binding affinity for certain receptors or enzymes. This feature is particularly relevant for genes involved in receptor signaling pathways, such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which encode dopamine receptors.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
