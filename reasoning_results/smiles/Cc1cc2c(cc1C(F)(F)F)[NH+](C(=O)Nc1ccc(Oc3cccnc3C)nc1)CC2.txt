Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc2c(cc1C(F)(F)F)[NH+](C(=O)Nc1ccc(Oc3cccnc3C)nc1)CC2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups including aromatic rings, fluorine atoms, and a positively charged amine group. The presence of these features suggests that the molecule may interact with receptors or enzymes that have similar chemical properties.
Step 2: Among the provided genes, those encoding receptors or enzymes that could potentially interact with such a molecule include ABL1 (a tyrosine kinase), ADRA1D and ADRA2B (adrenergic receptors), ADRB2 (beta-adrenergic receptor), CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4 (cholinergic receptors), DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4 (dopamine receptors), HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 (serotonin receptors), and PTGS1 (cyclooxygenase). These genes encode proteins that could directly interact with the molecule due to their specific binding sites for ligands.
Step 3: The positively charged amine group in the molecule might be involved in electrostatic interactions with negatively charged regions of the receptor proteins encoded by the genes listed above, which are common in G-protein coupled receptors and ion channels.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of aromatic rings and fluorine atoms could indicate potential interactions with hydrophobic pockets or binding sites in the enzymes or receptors encoded by the genes. This is particularly relevant for genes like ABL1, which is a tyrosine kinase known to interact with small molecules through hydrophobic binding sites.
Step 5: Based on the structural features of the molecule, the related genes are likely to be those involved in signal transduction pathways, neurotransmission, and cellular response to stimuli. The specific genes identified are: ABL1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, PTGS1.
