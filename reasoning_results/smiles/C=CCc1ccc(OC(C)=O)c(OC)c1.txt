Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule, C=CCc1ccc(OC(C)=O)c(OC)c1, is a complex organic compound that contains several functional groups such as a double bond (C=C), an oxygen-containing group (OC), and a carbonyl group (C=O). This structure suggests it could interact with proteins that have binding sites for these functional groups.
Step 2: Considering the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an oxygen-containing group (OC), this molecule might be able to bind to receptors that recognize these functional groups, such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other ligand-binding proteins.
Step 3: Among the listed genes, several are associated with GPCRs, including CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4. These genes encode for receptors that bind various ligands, and the presence of a carbonyl and oxygen-containing group in the molecule suggests potential interactions with these receptors.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure may also interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. These enzymes are known to metabolize a wide range of drugs, and the molecule’s structure indicates it could be a substrate for some of these enzymes.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. These genes are involved in neurotransmitter receptor function and drug metabolism, respectively.
