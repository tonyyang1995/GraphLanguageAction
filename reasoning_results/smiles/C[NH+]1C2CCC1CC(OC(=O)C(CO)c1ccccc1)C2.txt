Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+]1C2CCC1CC(OC(=O)C(CO)c1ccccc1)C2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a nitrogen atom that is positively charged (NH+), which is part of an amide group (-CONH+) connected to a benzene ring. This structure suggests the molecule could interact with receptors or enzymes that have specific binding sites for such functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of the amide group (-CONH+) and the benzene ring structure in the molecule indicates potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism, particularly those requiring acetylation or other post-translational modifications, like CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize drugs containing similar functional groups.
Step 3: The benzene ring also suggests possible interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to its aromatic nature. Among the listed genes, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4 encode for such receptors, which might bind to the aromatic structure of the molecule.
Step 4: The presence of an ester group (OC(=O)C(CO)) in the molecule indicates it could potentially interact with enzymes involved in lipid metabolism or signaling pathways, such as PTGS1 (COX-1/COX-2), which is involved in prostaglandin synthesis.
Step 5: Given the complex structure and the presence of multiple functional groups, the molecule may not be specifically related to just one gene but rather to several genes that are involved in various metabolic pathways and receptor functions.
