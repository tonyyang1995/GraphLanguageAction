Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc(OC)cc(-c2cc3c[n-]c(=N)nc3[n-]c2=NC(=O)NC(C)(C)C)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure containing a benzene ring with multiple substituents including an amide group (-CONH2), an ester group (O=C-O), and a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH). These functional groups are often involved in binding to proteins that regulate various physiological processes.
Step 2: The presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) suggests potential for interaction with enzymes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are known to metabolize compounds containing phenolic groups. This indicates a possible relationship between the molecule and the genes encoding these enzymes, namely CYP2C9 and CYP2C19.
Step 3: The amide group (-CONH2) could potentially interact with receptors such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or ion channels, which are often targeted by drugs. Specifically, this group might interact with DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), which is a GPCR, and HTR2A (Serotonin receptor 5-HT2A), another GPCR.
Step 4: The presence of an ester group (O=C-O) suggests potential for interaction with esterases or lipases, which could be relevant to the metabolism and activity of the molecule. This could indicate a connection to genes involved in lipid metabolism, such as PTGS1 (Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1), but no direct gene matches are expected from this feature alone.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and the presence of multiple functional groups, the molecule could have a broad range of interactions with different types of proteins and receptors. However, based on the specific features identified, the most likely related genes are those encoding enzymes involved in metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19) and receptors involved in neurotransmission (DRD2, HTR2A).
Summary of Related Gene Names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19

These genes are involved in the metabolism and signaling pathways that the molecule might influence. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure containing a benzene ring with multiple substituents including an amide group (-CONH2), an ester group (O=C-O), and a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH). These functional groups are often involved in binding to proteins that regulate various physiological processes.
Step 2: The phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) suggests potential for interaction with enzymes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, indicating a possible relationship with these genes.
Step 3: The amide group (-CONH2) could interact with receptors such as GPCRs or ion channels, suggesting a potential link to genes like DRD2 and HTR2A.
Step 4: The ester group (O=C-O) may interact with esterases or lipases, possibly connecting the molecule to PTGS1, though this is less direct.
Step 5: Given the structure, the most probable related genes are CYP2C9, CYP2C19, DRD2, and HTR2A.
