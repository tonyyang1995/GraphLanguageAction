Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Nc1cccc2cccnc12)c1cccc([N+](=O)[O-])c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule has a structure that includes a pyrrole ring system, an amide group, and a quinoline-like moiety. These structural features suggest the molecule may be a ligand or inhibitor targeting receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmission or signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a quinoline-like moiety is particularly relevant because it aligns with the known binding sites for certain receptors and enzymes such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4). These receptors are known to have quinoline or similar functional groups in their active sites.
Step 3: Additionally, the amide group could interact with acidic residues in the binding pockets of enzymes like cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are important in drug metabolism and could affect the pharmacokinetics of the molecule.
Step 4: The overall structure also suggests potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to its aromatic and polar functional groups, which are common in ligands for these receptors. Specific GPCRs include HRH1 (histamine receptor) and HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6 (serotonin receptors).
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its likely interactions, the related genes would be those encoding receptors and enzymes that have quinoline-like moieties or amide groups in their active sites or binding pockets, including: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
