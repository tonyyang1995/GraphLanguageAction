Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc2[n-]c([O-])c(N=Nc3nc4ccccc4s3)c2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a tricyclic structure with a nitrogen atom in the ring, indicating it may be an amine or an imine. The presence of a negatively charged nitrogen (N=) and an oxygen (O-) indicates this could be a heterocyclic compound with basic and acidic functional groups, which are common in drugs targeting receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The molecule includes a benzene ring system, which is often found in drug molecules that interact with proteins such as GPCRs (G protein-coupled receptors) and ion channels. Benzene rings can form part of the binding pocket for these targets.
Step 3: The presence of a sulfoxide group (S=O) suggests the molecule might have modulatory effects on enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways, such as those associated with neurotransmitters. This group is known to interact with proteins and enzymes that regulate intracellular signaling.
Step 4: Given the molecular structure, particularly the amine and sulfoxide functionalities, the molecule could potentially interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes like cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes. These interactions are relevant to several of the listed genes, including CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and HTR2A (serotonin receptor), among others.
Step 5: Based on the molecular features and potential interactions, the related genes include CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, due to their roles in drug metabolism and neurotransmission. Additionally, genes involved in GPCR function such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4 could also be relevant. 
Summary of related genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
