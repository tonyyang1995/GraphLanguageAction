Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+](C(=O)CCCOc1ccc2[n-]c(=O)ccc2c1)C1CCCCC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom that is part of an amide group (-CONH), which suggests it could interact with proteins containing amine binding sites, such as receptors or enzymes. This feature is relevant to several genes listed, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, all of which encode for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or their associated proteins.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an ester group (-COOC-), indicating potential interactions with proteins that have acidic or hydrophobic binding sites. These features are particularly relevant to CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which encode cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The presence of a benzene ring in the molecule, along with the amide and carboxylic acid functionalities, suggests the molecule may be able to form hydrogen bonds and π-π stacking interactions with proteins. This structural feature is important for the interaction with genes encoding proteins involved in signaling pathways, such as PTGS1, which encodes cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1).
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule, with its multiple functional groups, indicates that it might act as a ligand for various receptors and enzymes. This is particularly relevant to genes like CYP3A4, which encodes a cytochrome P450 enzyme that metabolizes many drugs, and HTR1A, which encodes a serotonin receptor.
Step 5: Considering the detailed structure and the functional groups present in the molecule, it is likely to interact with a subset of the listed genes, primarily those involved in neurotransmitter signaling (such as DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), and ion channels (CACNA1H).
Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2, DRD3, DRD4
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4
- CACNA1H
- PTGS1 (COX-1)
