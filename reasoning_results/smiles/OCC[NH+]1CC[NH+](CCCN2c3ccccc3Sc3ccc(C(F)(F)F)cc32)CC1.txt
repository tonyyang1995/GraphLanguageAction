Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: OCC[NH+]1CC[NH+](CCCN2c3ccccc3Sc3ccc(C(F)(F)F)cc32)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule contains multiple functional groups such as amine groups (NH+) and aromatic rings, which are common in ligands that interact with receptors and enzymes. These functional groups suggest the molecule could potentially act as a modulator of proteins involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of the amine group (NH+) indicates that the molecule may be an agonist or antagonist for receptors that have amine binding sites, such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This is supported by the presence of several GPCR-related genes in the list, including DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), HTR1A (serotonin receptor 1A), HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A), HTR2B (serotonin receptor 2B), HTR2C (serotonin receptor 2C), CHRM1 (cholinergic receptor M1), CHRM3 (cholinergic receptor M3), and CHRM4 (cholinergic receptor M4).
Step 3: The aromatic ring system and the presence of fluorinated phenyl groups (F) might indicate the molecule has affinity for ion channels or transporters. For instance, KCNH2 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2) and SIGMAR1 (sigma-1 receptor) are potential targets due to their interaction with aromatic compounds and their role in neurotransmission and signaling.
Step 4: The molecule also contains a benzene ring with substituents like fluoro-substituted phenyl groups, which are known to be recognized by certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP enzymes). CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are among the genes encoding these enzymes, and the molecule’s structure suggests it could be a substrate or inhibitor for these enzymes.
Step 5: Given the complexity of the molecule and its potential interactions with various biological targets, it is likely that this compound could have a broad impact on multiple signaling pathways and metabolic processes. However, based on the structure and functional groups present, the most directly related genes appear to be those associated with GPCRs, ion channels, and CYP enzymes.
Summary of related gene names:
- GPCRs: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4
- Ion channels: KCNH2, SIGMAR1
- CYP enzymes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6
Note: The remaining genes listed do not have a direct structural basis for interaction with this particular molecule based on the given information. However, their involvement would depend on additional experimental evidence or context not provided here.
