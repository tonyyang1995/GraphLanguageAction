Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Clc1ccc(C(c2ccccc2Cl)C(Cl)Cl)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains multiple chlorine atoms and aromatic rings, suggesting it may interact with proteins involved in transport or signaling pathways.
Step 2: The presence of benzene rings and chlorinated substituents could potentially influence cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: The complex structure with multiple rings might also affect G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are known to have binding sites for various ligands.
Step 4: The molecule's hydrophobic nature and potential for forming hydrogen bonds could interact with ion channels like KCNH2 and LCK, which are involved in cardiac and neuronal function.
Step 5: Given the molecule's structural complexity and potential interactions with enzymes and receptors, it is most likely to be related to CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, and LCK.
Summary of Related Genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, LCK.
