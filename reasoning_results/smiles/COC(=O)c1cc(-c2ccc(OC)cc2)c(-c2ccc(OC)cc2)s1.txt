Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COC(=O)c1cc(-c2ccc(OC)cc2)c(-c2ccc(OC)cc2)s1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this is relevant.
Step 1: The molecule has a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and a sulfonamide group attached. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize drugs with similar functional groups.
Step 2: Additionally, the presence of a pyrrole ring and a quinoline ring in the molecule indicates possible interactions with receptors and ion channels. For instance, the quinoline ring might interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are encoded by genes like DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a lactam structure, which could potentially interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways. Genes such as EGFR and PTGS1 may be relevant due to their roles in cellular signaling and inflammation.
Step 4: The molecule’s structure includes a phenolic hydroxyl group, which could lead to interactions with enzymes that regulate calcium channels or other ion channels, such as KCNH2.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and functional groups, the molecule is likely to interact with multiple genes involved in drug metabolism, receptor binding, and signal transduction. Therefore, the related genes include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, EGFR, PTGS1, and KCNH2. 
Summary of related gene names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, EGFR, PTGS1, KCNH2.
