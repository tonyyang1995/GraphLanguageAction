Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Nc1ccc2c(c1)nc1n2CC[NH+](C2CCCCC2)C1)c1ccco1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with multiple substitutions, including a nitrile group (-CN), an amide group (-CONH-), and a phenyl ring substituted with a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (quinoline-like). This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a quinoline-like heterocycle and a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) may indicate possible interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes, specifically CYP2D6 and CYP2C9, which are known to metabolize similar functional groups.
Step 3: The molecule also features a pyrrolidine ring, which could interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as HTR2A and HTR2C, as these receptors often contain similar structural motifs.
Step 4: The overall structure does not strongly suggest direct interactions with kinases or receptors listed for LCK, KDR, HRH1, or CHRM1-4, as these typically require more specific ligand-binding domains.
Step 5: Based on the identified features, the molecule is likely to be related to CYP2D6, CYP2C9, HTR2A, and HTR2C.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, HTR2A, HTR2C. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with multiple substitutions, including a nitrile group (-CN), an amide group (-CONH-), and a phenyl ring substituted with a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (quinoline-like). This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, HTR2A, HTR2C. Step 1: The molecule has a benzene ring with various functional groups, suggesting it might interact with metabolic enzymes.
Step 2: The quinoline-like heterocycle and phenolic hydroxyl group indicate potential interaction with CYP2D6 and CYP2C9.
Step 3: The pyrrolidine ring points to possible binding with HTR2A and HTR2C receptors.
Step 4: No strong indications for LCK, KDR, HR
