Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COC(=O)CN=c1[n-][n-]c(=S)[n-]c1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a structure that includes a benzene ring, an amide group (-CONH), and a thiophene ring with a sulfur atom. This structure suggests the molecule could interact with enzymes involved in metabolism and signaling pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a thiophene ring and the nitrogen atoms in the molecule indicate it may be capable of forming hydrogen bonds and interacting with proteins that have these functional groups, such as receptors and transporters.
Step 3: Given the presence of the amide group, this molecule could potentially act as a substrate for enzymes like CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize amides, or as an inhibitor of certain enzymes if it fits into their active site.
Step 4: Considering the overall structure, the molecule might interact with genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to the presence of multiple aromatic rings and nitrogen atoms, which are common features of GPCR ligands.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule could be related to several genes, including CYP2D6, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which encode various serotonin and dopamine receptors.
Summary of related genes: CYP2D6, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
