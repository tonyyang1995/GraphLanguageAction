Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)NCc2ccccc2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that includes a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH), which is a common functional group in drugs targeting various receptors and enzymes. The presence of this functional group suggests potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for such groups.
Step 2: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is a common structural motif in many drugs. Benzene rings are known to interact with a variety of proteins, including receptors and transporters. This structural feature could be relevant to the function of several of the listed genes, particularly those involved in receptor activity and drug metabolism.
Step 3: The sulfonamide group, along with the benzene rings, could potentially interact with enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and other metabolic pathways, making the molecule relevant to genes involved in drug metabolism and response.
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule, with its aromatic rings and polar functional groups, may also be able to bind to ion channels (e.g., KCNH2, CACNA1H) or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), and serotonergic receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Step 5: Given the structural features and potential interactions, the molecule could be related to multiple genes involved in neurotransmission, ion channel regulation, and drug metabolism, including: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, CACNA1H, and possibly others depending on the exact mechanism of action of the molecule.
