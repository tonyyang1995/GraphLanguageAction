Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC1(C)NC(Nc2cccc(Br)c2)=[NH+]C(N)=[NH+]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a nitrogen atom double-bonded to a carbon atom (N=N), which is a common feature in many drugs that interact with receptors. This suggests the molecule may have affinity for receptors that contain such a binding site.
Step 2: The presence of bromine (Br) and amide groups (-CONH-) indicates potential for steric hindrance and hydrogen bonding interactions, respectively. These features are important for receptor binding and could influence how the molecule interacts with proteins.
Step 3: The molecule has multiple amide groups, which can form hydrogen bonds and contribute to its binding affinity with proteins, particularly those with hydrophobic pockets or active sites.
Step 4: Given the structure, this molecule might interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to the presence of amides and the overall shape, which could align with the hydrophobic core and the binding pocket of these receptors.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and potential interactions with GPCRs, the following genes are likely to be related to this molecule: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1. These genes encode receptors that are involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways.
