Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1[n-]oc2c1CC[NH2+]C2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a core structure that includes a pyrrole ring fused to a benzene ring, with a cyano group (-CN) attached to the benzene ring. This core structure is commonly found in ligands that interact with receptors involved in neurotransmission and hormone signaling.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-NH2) and a positively charged nitrogen atom (N+) suggests the molecule may act as a partial agonist or antagonist at certain receptors, which could be relevant to genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or ion channels.
Step 3: The molecule contains a carboxylate group (-COO-) and a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH), which are functional groups often associated with compounds that modulate the activity of enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: Given the presence of multiple amine groups and the overall structure, the molecule could potentially interact with receptors that bind small molecules containing amino groups, such as dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 5: Considering the above structural features and the potential for interaction with various receptor types and metabolic enzymes, the molecule is most likely related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, ADRB2, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4.
