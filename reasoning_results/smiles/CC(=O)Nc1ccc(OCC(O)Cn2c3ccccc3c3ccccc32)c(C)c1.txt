Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(OCC(O)Cn2c3ccccc3c3ccccc32)c(C)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a structure that includes an amide (N=C=O), a nitrogen atom, and multiple aromatic rings. This indicates it is likely an organic compound with potential for interaction with proteins, particularly those involved in neurotransmission or signal transduction.
Step 2: Considering the presence of the amide and the aromatic rings, the molecule could potentially interact with enzymes such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, which are known to metabolize drugs and other xenobiotics. This suggests a possible interaction with CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a benzene ring with an oxygen atom attached, which might indicate the presence of a phenolic group. Such groups can interact with receptors like G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Notably, HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A) and HTR2B (serotonin receptor 2B) are GPCRs that could be influenced by this type of molecular feature.
Step 4: The presence of a quinoline-like structure (quinoline is a heterocyclic compound with a benzene ring fused to a pyridine ring) in the molecule might suggest interactions with receptors that bind to similar structures. For example, the molecule could potentially interact with the adrenergic receptors ADRA1D and ADRA2B, which have quinoline-like moieties in their ligands.
Step 5: Given the identified structural features, the molecule is most likely to be related to the genes encoding the serotonin receptors HTR2A and HTR2B, as well as the adrenergic receptors ADRA1D and ADRA2B.
Summary of related gene names: HTR2A, HTR2B, ADRA1D, ADRA2B. Step 1: The molecule has a structure that includes an amide (N=C=O), a nitrogen atom, and multiple aromatic rings. This indicates it is likely an organic compound with potential for interaction with proteins, particularly those involved in neurotransmission or signal transduction.
