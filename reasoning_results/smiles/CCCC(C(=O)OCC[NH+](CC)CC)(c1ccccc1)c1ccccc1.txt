Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCC(C(=O)OCC[NH+](CC)CC)(c1ccccc1)c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that contains a benzene ring (indicated by 'c1ccccc1') and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in cellular signaling pathways and drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and a carboxylic acid group could indicate that this molecule might interact with enzymes such as cytochrome P450s (CYP), which are involved in the metabolism of various drugs and xenobiotics. Specifically, it may be relevant to CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize a wide range of compounds including those with aromatic rings and carboxylic acid functionalities.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule’s structure includes a pyrrolidine ring system (indicated by the cyclohexane-like structure within the benzene ring) and an amine group (indicated by '[NH+]'), which can form hydrogen bonds and other types of non-covalent interactions with proteins. This could potentially affect receptors like G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels. Relevant genes here include HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and KCNH2, which encode for serotonin receptors and potassium channels, respectively.
Step 4: Furthermore, the presence of a quinoline-like structure (indicated by the c1ccccc1 pattern) might suggest potential interactions with nuclear receptors, such as the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG), which is encoded by the PPARG gene.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and the potential interactions with various enzymes and receptors, the related genes are: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, KCNH2, and PPARG.
Summary of Related Genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, KCNH2, PPARG.
