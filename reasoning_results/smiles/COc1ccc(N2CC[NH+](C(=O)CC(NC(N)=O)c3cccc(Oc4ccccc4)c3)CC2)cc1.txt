Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(N2CC[NH+](C(=O)CC(NC(N)=O)c3cccc(Oc4ccccc4)c3)CC2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains several functional groups such as amine (N), carboxyl (C=O), and aromatic rings (c-c). These functional groups suggest that the molecule could potentially interact with proteins involved in neurotransmission, signal transduction, or metabolism.
Step 2: Analyzing the pattern of the molecule, it includes a nitrogen atom that forms part of an amide group (C=O-NH) and a carboxylic acid group (C=O-OH). This indicates the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes involved in metabolism or signaling pathways.
Step 3: Considering the presence of aromatic rings and the overall structure, this molecule might interact with receptors or enzymes that are involved in neurotransmitter systems, which are often associated with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes like CYPs (Cytochrome P450).
Step 4: Given the complexity and the specific functional groups present, the molecule is likely to have interactions with multiple genes. However, based on the provided list, the most relevant genes would be those involved in neurotransmission, signal transduction, and metabolic pathways.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the following genes are likely to be involved: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, PTGS1, and SIGMAR1. These genes are associated with receptors and enzymes that could interact with the described molecular features.
