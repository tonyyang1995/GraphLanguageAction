Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc2c(cc1OC)-c1cc3ccc(OC)c(OC)c3c[n+]1CC2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains several aromatic rings, particularly benzene rings, which are common in many drugs that interact with receptors and enzymes. This structural feature suggests potential interactions with genes encoding for receptors or enzymes that have aromatic amino acid binding sites.
Step 2: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) and a cyano group (-CN) indicates that the molecule could be an inhibitor or activator of enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP (Cytochrome P450) genes. For instance, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are known to metabolize drugs containing these functional groups.
Step 3: The molecule also includes an amide (-CONH-) and an ester (-COO-) linkage, which are often found in ligands that bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Genes like DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), HTR1A (Serotonin receptor 1A), and CHRM1 (Choline acetyltransferase) encode proteins that could potentially interact with this part of the molecule.
Step 4: The presence of a quinolone-like structure (quinolin-8-one) might suggest interactions with genes encoding ion channels or transporters. CNR1 (Cannabinoid receptor 1) and SLC6A4 (Monoamine transporter) are examples of genes that could be influenced by this structural feature.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR1A, CHRM1, CNR1, and SLC6A4. These genes encode enzymes and receptors that may directly or indirectly interact with the molecule due to its functional groups and structural elements. 
Summary of related genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR1A, CHRM1, CNR1, SLC6A4.
