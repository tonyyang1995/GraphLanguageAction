Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: FC(F)(F)c1ccc(N2CCN(c3cc(-c4ccccc4)nc4ncnn34)CC2)nc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule containing fluorine (F), nitrogen (N), carbon (C), and other elements. The molecule has multiple functional groups such as amides, aromatic rings, and potentially hydroxyl groups. The presence of fluorine atoms suggests this molecule could be an analog or derivative of a known compound, possibly a drug.
Step 2: Analyzing the structure for potential pharmacological activity, the molecule's presence of aromatic rings and amide groups indicates it might interact with receptors or enzymes that bind to similar structures. Specifically, the amide group could form hydrogen bonds, which are important for binding to many protein targets.
Step 3: Considering the presence of nitrogen-containing heterocycles (likely due to the N2CCN part), this molecule could potentially interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) since they often have binding sites for molecules containing nitrogen heterocycles.
Step 4: Given the potential interaction with GPCRs and the presence of specific receptor families like adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), the molecule might modulate signaling pathways involving these receptors.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
Summary of related gene names:
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- ADRB2
- DRD2
- DRD3
- DRD4 Step 5: Summary of related gene names:
- DRD4
These genes are involved in neurotransmitter signaling and could be affected by the molecule through its potential interactions with receptors. The other genes listed do not appear to have a direct structural or functional relationship based on the given molecular information. However, further biochemical assays would be necessary to confirm any specific interactions.
