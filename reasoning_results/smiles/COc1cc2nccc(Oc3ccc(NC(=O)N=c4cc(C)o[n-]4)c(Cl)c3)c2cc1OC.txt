Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc2nccc(Oc3ccc(NC(=O)N=c4cc(C)o[n-]4)c(Cl)c3)c2cc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound that includes a benzene ring system, a pyrrole ring, a phenol group, and several heteroatoms such as nitrogen and oxygen. The presence of these structural features suggests that the molecule may interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, as many signaling molecules have similar structures.
Step 2: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring fused to a benzene ring, which is characteristic of indole derivatives. Indoles are known to bind to various receptors, including G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and nuclear receptors. This structural feature could potentially allow the molecule to interact with GPCRs or other receptors involved in neurotransmission or hormone binding.
Step 3: The molecule also has an amide group (-CONH-) attached to a benzene ring, which is common in ligands for enzymes like CYP enzymes (cytochrome P450 enzymes). These enzymes are involved in the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics, so the presence of this functional group might suggest that the molecule could be metabolized by CYP enzymes.
Step 4: The presence of a phenol group (-OH attached to a benzene ring) indicates potential for interaction with proteins that have hydrophobic binding pockets or that contain metal ions, as phenols can form hydrogen bonds and coordinate with metals. This structural feature could be relevant for proteins involved in calcium signaling or ion transport.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and the above considerations, the related genes might include those encoding for receptors and enzymes that interact with similar chemical structures. Specifically, the related genes could be: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CNR1, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, and OPNK1. These genes encode for GPCRs, enzymes involved in drug metabolism, and transporters that may interact directly or indirectly with the described molecular structure. 
Summary of Related Genes:
- GPCRs: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CNR1
- Metabolism: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4
- Transporters: PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4
- Opioid Receptor: OPRK1
These genes are involved in pathways that could be affected by the molecule due to its structural features. However, the exact mechanism of action would need further experimental validation.
