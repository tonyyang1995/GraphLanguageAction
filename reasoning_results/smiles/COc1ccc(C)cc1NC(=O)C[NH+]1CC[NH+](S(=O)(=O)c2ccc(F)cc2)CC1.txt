Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(C)cc1NC(=O)C[NH+]1CC[NH+](S(=O)(=O)c2ccc(F)cc2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups, including a benzene ring, an amide group (-CONH), a sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)), and several aromatic heterocycles such as pyrrole (c1ccc(C)cc1) and furan (c2ccc(F)cc2). These functional groups suggest the molecule could interact with various biological targets, potentially including enzymes, receptors, and transporters.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-CONH) and a sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)) indicates the molecule could act as an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These cytochrome P450 enzymes are known to metabolize many drugs, and their activity can be influenced by small molecules that bind to them.
Step 3: The benzene ring and aromatic heterocycles in the molecule might enable it to interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are often targeted by drugs. Specifically, the molecule could potentially interact with DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), HTR2A (serotonin receptor 5-HT2A), and HTR2B (serotonin receptor 5-HT2B), which are all GPCRs.
Step 4: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the sulfonamide group (N in S(=O)(=O)N) suggests the molecule may have the potential to interact with ion channels, particularly those containing a positively charged residue at the binding site. This could be relevant for KCNH2 (potassium channel subfamily H member 2), which is a voltage-gated potassium channel.
Step 5: Given the complex structure and the presence of functional groups that could interact with enzymes and receptors, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes involved in drug metabolism and signaling pathways, including CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, KCNH2, and others.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
