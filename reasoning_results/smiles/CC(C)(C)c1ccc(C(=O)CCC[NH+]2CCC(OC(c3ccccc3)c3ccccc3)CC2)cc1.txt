Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)(C)c1ccc(C(=O)CCC[NH+]2CCC(OC(c3ccccc3)c3ccccc3)CC2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples or additional text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with an acetyl group attached, which is a common feature in ligands for certain G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural pattern is relevant to GPCRs such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
Step 2: The molecule also has a pyrrolidine ring, which is characteristic of ligands for some GPCRs like HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These receptors are involved in serotonin signaling.
Step 3: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in the molecule suggests potential interactions with enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: The molecule includes a phenyl ring with a nitro group (-NO2), which can interact with various proteins, including those involved in signal transduction pathways, such as PTGS1 (cyclooxygenase-1).
Step 5: The overall structure of the molecule, particularly its size and functional groups, may influence its binding affinity to the calcium channel CACNA1H and the receptor PTGS1.
