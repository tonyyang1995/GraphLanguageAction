Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc(N=c2[n-]cc(Cl)c(=Nc3ccccc3S(=O)(=O)C(C)C)[n-]2)c(OC(C)C)cc1C1CC[NH2+]CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a negative charge, indicated by [n-], which is part of a heterocyclic ring system. This structural feature is common in ligands that interact with receptors such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are often involved in signal transduction pathways mediated by neurotransmitters and hormones.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) attached to a benzene ring, which is known to be a functional group involved in binding to enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYP enzymes). This suggests potential interactions with genes encoding these enzymes, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 3: The presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) indicates the molecule could potentially act as an agonist or antagonist for receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B) and dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4).
Step 4: The molecule has a structure that might allow it to interact with ion channels, particularly those involved in calcium regulation, such as CACNA1H.
Step 5: Considering the diverse pharmacophoric features, the molecule could have interactions with multiple genes, including but not limited to: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KDR, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
