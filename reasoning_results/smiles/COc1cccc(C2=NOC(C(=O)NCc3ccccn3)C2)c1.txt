Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cccc(C2=NOC(C(=O)NCc3ccccn3)C2)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that contains several functional groups such as amide (-CO-N), imine (-N=C-), and aromatic rings (c-c-c-c). These structural features suggest the molecule may have biological activity, potentially interacting with proteins that contain similar functional groups or are involved in metabolic pathways.
Step 2: Analyzing the genes listed, many are associated with receptors, enzymes, and signaling pathways. The molecule's presence of an imine group (-N=C-) and an amide group (-CO-N) indicates it could be a potential ligand for protein targets that recognize such functional groups. Additionally, the aromatic rings suggest interactions with proteins containing hydrophobic binding sites.
Step 3: Considering the molecular structure, the molecule might interact with genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to its amine and aromatic components. This includes genes like DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), HTR1A (serotonin receptor 1A), and CHRM1 (cholinergic receptor muscarinic M1), which all have amino and aromatic residues in their binding pockets.
Step 4: The molecule's structure also hints at potential interaction with enzymes, particularly those involved in metabolism. Genes such as CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, which encode cytochrome P450 enzymes responsible for drug metabolism, could be relevant if the molecule is designed to inhibit or induce these enzymes.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the related genes are likely to be:
- GPCRs: DRD2, HTR1A, CHRM1
- Metabolic enzymes: CYP2C19, CYP2D6
These genes are the most plausible candidates for interaction with the described molecule based on its chemical structure. Other genes listed do not have as strong a direct connection to the molecule's structure and function. Step 6: Summary of related gene names: DRD2, HTR1A, CHRM1, CYP2C19, CYP2D6. These genes are most likely to have a relationship with the molecule based on its chemical structure.
