Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(S(N)(=O)=O)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that includes a carboxamide group (CC(=O)N) and a benzene ring substituted with a sulfur-containing group (S(N)(=O)=O). This structural pattern suggests the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors that interact with such functional groups.
Step 2: Among the listed genes, those encoding enzymes involved in metabolism or drug transport are likely to be relevant. CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 are known to metabolize various drugs, including those with carboxamide and sulfonamide functionalities. Therefore, these enzymes may interact directly with the molecule.
Step 3: Additionally, some of the listed genes encode for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which often bind small molecules like drugs. DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which encode dopamine receptors, and HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which encode serotonin receptors, could potentially interact with the molecule due to its chemical structure.
Step 4: The presence of a carboxamide and a sulfonamide group might also suggest interactions with ion channels or transporters. However, based on the provided list, there are no specific genes for these types of proteins.
Step 5: Based on the analysis, the genes related to the molecule are: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- DRD2
- DRD3
- DRD4
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
