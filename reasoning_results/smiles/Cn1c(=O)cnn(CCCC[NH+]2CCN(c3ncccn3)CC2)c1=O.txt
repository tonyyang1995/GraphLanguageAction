Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cn1c(=O)cnn(CCCC[NH+]2CCN(c3ncccn3)CC2)c1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that is structurally similar to a benzodiazepine derivative. Benzodiazepines are known to interact with GABAA receptors, which are ion channels that play a crucial role in inhibiting neuronal activity.
Step 2: The molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring, which is characteristic of many GABAA receptor ligands. Additionally, it has a quinolone-like moiety, which can be involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction pathways.
Step 3: The presence of a quinolone-like moiety suggests potential interactions with enzymes such as CYP2D6, which is involved in the metabolism of many drugs, including some that target neurotransmitter systems. This enzyme is also known to be associated with genetic polymorphisms that can affect drug response.
Step 4: Given the structure's potential to interact with GABAA receptors and influence neurotransmission, it could also potentially interact with other receptors involved in neurotransmitter systems. For example, it might interact with serotonin receptors (e.g., HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), dopamine receptors (e.g., DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), or cholinergic receptors (e.g., CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 5: Considering the above points, the molecule may be related to several genes involved in neurotransmitter systems and drug metabolism. The related gene names include: CYP2D6, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4.
