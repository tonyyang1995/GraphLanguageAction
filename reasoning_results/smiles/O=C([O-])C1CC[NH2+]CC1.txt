Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])C1CC[NH2+]CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule has a core structure that includes a benzene ring and a carbonyl group, which is characteristic of many drugs that interact with receptors or enzymes. This structure suggests potential interactions with genes encoding drug targets such as receptors or metabolic enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-NH2) indicates the molecule could potentially bind to proteins with amine binding sites, including G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4 encode such receptors.
Step 3: The negative charge on the oxygen atom (-O-) suggests the molecule may act as a ligand for ion channels or transporters. Genes like KCNH2 and SLC6A2 are relevant here.
Step 4: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) or similar functional groups can indicate interactions with enzymes like CYP2D6, which metabolizes various drugs.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and functional groups, the molecule is most likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, KCNH2, SLC6A2, and CYP2D6. Step 5: Related Gene Names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, KCNH2, SLC6A2, CYP2D6.
