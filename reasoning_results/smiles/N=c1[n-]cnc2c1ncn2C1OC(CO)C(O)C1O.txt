Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N=c1[n-]cnc2c1ncn2C1OC(CO)C(O)C1O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule, represented by the SMILES string N=c1[n-]cnc2c1ncn2C1OC(CO)C(O)C1O, contains a nitrogen atom with a negative charge (N[=c1[n-]cnc2c1ncn2]), indicating it has a basic functional group. Additionally, it includes several aromatic rings and hydroxyl groups (-OH), which are characteristic of many bioactive molecules.
Step 2: Analyzing the structure further, we see that the molecule contains a benzene ring (C1OC(CO)C(O)C1O) and a substituted pyrrole ring (N[=c1[n-]cnc2c1ncn2]). These aromatic systems suggest the molecule could interact with receptors or enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways, which often involve ligand-receptor interactions mediated by such structures.
Step 3: Considering the presence of hydroxyl groups and the overall molecular complexity, this compound may act as an agonist or antagonist for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are a family of receptors that include HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, all of which are listed among the given genes. The hydroxyl groups can form hydrogen bonds with the receptor, modulating its activity.
Step 4: The benzene ring and other aromatic moieties might also interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of various drugs and xenobiotics. This interaction could influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the molecule.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule is likely related to the following genes: HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These genes encode proteins that play crucial roles in neurotransmission and drug metabolism, making them potential targets for the molecule's biological activities.
