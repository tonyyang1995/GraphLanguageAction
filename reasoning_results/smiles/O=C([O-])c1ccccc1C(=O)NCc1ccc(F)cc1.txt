Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])c1ccccc1C(=O)NCc1ccc(F)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex molecule that includes an amide, an ester, a benzene ring, and several functional groups such as hydroxyl, methyl, and fluorine. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is often associated with ligands that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH2) could indicate a potential interaction with receptors that have an amine binding site, such as dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4).
Step 3: The molecule also has a quinoline-like structure, which might suggest interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6), given their role in metabolizing drugs with similar chemical structures.
Step 4: The presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) and a carbonyl group (-CO) in the molecule could imply potential interactions with enzymes like PTGS1 (cyclooxygenase-1), which is involved in prostaglandin synthesis and is also a target for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
Step 5: The molecule’s structure may also suggest interactions with receptors that bind to endocannabinoids (CNR1), given the presence of aromatic rings and potential hydrogen bonding capabilities.
Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2
- DRD3
- DRD4
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- PTGS1
- CNR1 Step 5: Summary of related gene names:
- CNR1
These genes are potentially related to the molecule based on its structural features and possible pharmacological activities. Further experimental validation would be necessary to confirm any specific interactions.
