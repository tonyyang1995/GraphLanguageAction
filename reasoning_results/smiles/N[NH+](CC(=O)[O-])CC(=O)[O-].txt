Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N[NH+](CC(=O)[O-])CC(=O)[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule is a derivative of nicotine, specifically an imidazolium salt. It contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge and a pyridine ring, which are characteristic features of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) ligands.
Step 2: The presence of a pyridine ring and the overall structure suggest that this molecule could interact with nAChRs, which are involved in the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This interaction could modulate neurotransmission and potentially affect the expression or function of certain genes associated with neurotransmitter signaling.
Step 3: Given the interaction with nAChRs, several genes related to acetylcholine receptors and signaling pathways are likely to be affected. These include CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which encode for muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and dopamine receptors respectively.
Step 4: The molecule may also influence genes involved in stress responses and neuronal plasticity due to its potential effects on neurotransmission. Genes such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode for serotonin receptors, could be relevant.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule might impact genes involved in inflammation and pain pathways, such as PTGS1, which encodes for cyclooxygenase-1, a key enzyme in prostaglandin synthesis.
