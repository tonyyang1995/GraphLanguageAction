Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(CSc1nc2ccccc2o1)N1c2ccccc2Sc2ccc(Cl)cc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with substituents, including a cyano group and a nitro group, which are characteristic of certain drug molecules that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This suggests potential interaction with genes encoding GPCRs.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule indicates it could be an amine, which often serves as an agonist or antagonist for GPCRs. This further supports the possibility of interaction with GPCRs encoded by the listed genes.
Step 3: Several genes in the list encode GPCRs, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These receptors are involved in various physiological processes such as neurotransmission and hormone signaling.
Step 4: The molecular structure also includes a quinolone-like moiety, which might indicate potential interactions with enzymes like CYP2D6, known to metabolize many drugs, and PTGS1, which encodes an enzyme involved in prostaglandin synthesis.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and potential pharmacological activities, the molecule is likely to interact with several GPCRs and enzymes, specifically ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2D6, and PTGS1. 
Summary of related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2D6, PTGS1.
