Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CN=c1[n-]n2c3c(cnc2c1S(=O)(=O)c1ccccc1)C[NH+](C)CC3, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule contains a complex structure including a pyrrole ring system, a thiosemicarbazone moiety, and a sulfonamide group. This type of structure is often found in compounds that interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are known to be associated with various neurotransmitter systems and signaling pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a thiosemicarbazone moiety suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP (cytochrome P450) genes, particularly CYP2D6 and CYP2C9. These enzymes are involved in the metabolism of many drugs, including those that target GPCRs.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a quinoline ring system, which can form hydrogen bonds and other interactions with amino acid residues in receptor binding sites. This feature is relevant to GPCRs, as they often have binding pockets that include hydrophobic and polar regions.
Step 4: Given the presence of a sulfonamide group, the molecule may also interact with ion channels, such as those encoded by KCNH2, which is a potassium channel gene. Sulfonamides are known to modulate the activity of some ion channels.
Step 5: Considering the above structural features and their potential interactions with proteins, the molecule could be related to several genes involved in neurotransmission, drug metabolism, and ion channel function. Specifically, the related genes include: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, and OPRK1.
Summary of Related Genes: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, OPRK1.
