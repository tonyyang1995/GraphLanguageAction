Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)(Oc1ccc(C2CC2(Cl)Cl)cc1)C(=O)[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with a substituted phenolic hydroxyl group (O) and an amide group (C(=O)[O-]). This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP (cytochrome P450) enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a halogen atom (Cl) attached to a benzene ring could indicate potential interactions with transporters like ABCB1, which is known to be involved in the efflux of xenobiotics and drugs.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a pyrimidine ring, which is common in many ligands for receptors and enzymes. This could suggest potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 4: The molecule has a quinoline ring, which might interact with enzymes involved in phase I metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4.
Step 5: Given the overall structure and functional groups present in the molecule, it is likely to interact with multiple genes involved in drug metabolism and receptor signaling, including ABCB1, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
