Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NS(=O)(=O)c1cc(C2(O)NC(=O)c3ccccc32)ccc1Cl, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound with a nitrogen atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom (N=O), indicating it likely contains a nitrile group (-CN) or an amide group (-CONH-). This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism and detoxification, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize drugs containing these functional groups.
Step 2: The molecule also has a benzene ring system connected to a chlorine atom, which could indicate potential binding sites for certain receptors or transporters. Benzene rings are common in ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which include DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, and HTR2B, all of which are involved in neurotransmission.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH-) could suggest potential interactions with ion channels, such as KCNH2, which encodes the HERG potassium channel, important in cardiac repolarization.
Step 4: The overall complexity and functional groups present in the molecule suggest it may interact with multiple targets, but given the detailed structure, it is more likely to have a primary interaction with enzymes involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4) and receptors involved in neurotransmission (DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B).
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the most relevant genes for this molecule are: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B. These genes encode proteins that could potentially interact directly with the molecule or be involved in its metabolism and distribution within the body.
