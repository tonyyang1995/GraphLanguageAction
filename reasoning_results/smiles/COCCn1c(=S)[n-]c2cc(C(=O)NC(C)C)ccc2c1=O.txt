Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound with multiple functional groups including an amide, sulfoxide, and a nitro group. It also contains a cyclic nitrogen atom that is part of a heterocyclic ring.
Step 2: Upon analyzing the structure, it appears that this molecule could potentially interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism due to its presence of functional groups such as the amide and sulfoxide, which are common substrates for CYP (Cytochrome P450) enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These enzymes are known to metabolize various drugs, and their activity can be influenced by the chemical structure of the substrate.
Step 3: The molecule also has a quinolone-like structure, which might suggest potential interactions with receptors or transporters that are sensitive to similar chemical structures. For example, CYP3A4, which is another member of the CYP family, could have a role in metabolizing this molecule, as well as other enzymes like CYP1A2 and CYP2C9.
Step 4: Considering the presence of a nitro group and the overall complexity of the molecule, it may also interact with enzymes involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics, such as those encoded by the ABC transporter family, specifically ABCB1, which is responsible for pumping certain drugs out of cells.
Step 5: Given the detailed analysis, the related genes to this molecule are likely to be those involved in drug metabolism and transport, specifically CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP1A2, ABCB1, and possibly others depending on the exact mechanism of action of the molecule.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
