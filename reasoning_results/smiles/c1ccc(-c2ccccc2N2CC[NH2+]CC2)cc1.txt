Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: c1ccc(-c2ccccc2N2CC[NH2+]CC2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that contains aromatic rings and heteroatoms such as nitrogen and oxygen. This structural complexity suggests the molecule could potentially interact with proteins involved in signaling pathways, metabolism, or transport processes.
Step 2: Analyzing the genes listed, many are associated with receptors, enzymes, and transporters which could interact with small molecules due to their functional roles in the cell. For instance, CYP (Cytochrome P450) enzymes like CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 are known for metabolizing various drugs and xenobiotics, suggesting potential interactions with the given molecule.
Step 3: Additionally, neurotransmitter receptors such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C (serotonin receptors) could be relevant if the molecule has a pharmacological profile similar to serotonin agonists or antagonists, as it might modulate neuronal signaling.
Step 4: Considering the presence of amine groups and other functional groups, the molecule might also interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4, which are involved in adrenaline and acetylcholine signaling.
Step 5: Based on the structural and functional analysis, the molecule could be related to the following genes: CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4.
Summary of Related Genes: CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4. These genes encode proteins that could interact with or be influenced by the described molecule through various mechanisms such as drug metabolism, neurotransmission, and receptor binding.
