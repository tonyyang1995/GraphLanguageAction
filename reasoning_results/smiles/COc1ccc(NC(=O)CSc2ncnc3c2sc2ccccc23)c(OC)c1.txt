Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(NC(=O)CSc2ncnc3c2sc2ccccc23)c(OC)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with a central benzene ring (c1...c1), containing a nitrogen atom (N) and a carboxamide group (-NC(=O)-). This suggests it could be an organic compound with potential pharmacological activity.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group (-NC(=O)-) indicates that this molecule might act as an inhibitor or activator of enzymes or receptors. Carboxamides are common in drugs targeting G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other membrane proteins.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a cyclic amide (SC...c...c...c...S) and a phenolic hydroxyl group (OC), which are structural elements found in various neurotransmitter modulators and receptor ligands. These functional groups are often involved in binding to receptors such as GPCRs and ion channels.
Step 4: Considering the pattern of the molecule and its functional groups, it is likely to interact with receptors or enzymes that are part of the nervous system or involved in signal transduction pathways. Genes related to neurotransmitter systems and receptor signaling are the most probable candidates for interaction.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule may be related to several genes involved in neurotransmitter signaling and receptor function. These include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, and SIGMAR1.
