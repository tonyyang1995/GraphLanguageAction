Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)COc1cc(OCC(=O)OCC)c2c(=O)cc(-c3ccccc3)oc2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound with multiple functional groups, including an amide (CO), ester (C=O), and cyclic ether (OCC). The presence of these functional groups suggests that the molecule may have pharmacological activity, particularly affecting enzymes and receptors involved in neurotransmission and metabolism.
Step 2: Analyzing the molecular structure, it contains a benzene ring with an amide group attached, which could interact with proteins such as enzymes or receptors. The amide and ester functionalities are common in ligands for various receptors and enzymes, including those encoded by genes like CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which encode cytochrome P450 enzymes responsible for metabolizing drugs.
Step 3: Additionally, the cyclic ether motif in the molecule could potentially interact with ion channels or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C are associated with GPCRs and neurotransmitter receptors, making them relevant candidates for interaction with this molecule.
Step 4: Furthermore, the presence of a benzene ring and ester functionality might also suggest potential interactions with kinases, as seen in genes like CDK2 and LCK, which encode cyclin-dependent kinases and Lck (a tyrosine kinase), respectively.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names: CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CDK2, and LCK. These genes are likely to be involved in the pharmacological effects of the molecule due to their roles in drug metabolism, neurotransmission, and cellular signaling. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups, including amides, esters, and cyclic ethers.
Step 2: The amide and ester functionalities suggest potential interactions with enzymes, particularly cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Step 3: The cyclic ether motif may interact with ion channels or GPCRs, linking to genes encoding receptors like adrenergic and serotonin receptors.
Step 4: The benzene ring and ester functionality indicate possible interactions with kinases, such as cyclin-dependent kinases.
Step 5: Summary of related genes: CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CDK2, LCK.
