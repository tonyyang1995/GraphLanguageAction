Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NC(=[NH2+])N=c1[n-]c(CSCCC(=[NH2+])NS(N)(=O)=O)cs1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a quinolizidine ring system, which is a common structural feature found in many alkaloids. This structural motif is often associated with interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other neurotransmitter systems.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-CONH2+) and a sulfonamide group (-NS(N)(=O)) suggests that the molecule may act as a ligand for various receptors, particularly those involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways. These functional groups are known to interact with multiple receptor types, including GPCRs.
Step 3: Given the pattern of the molecule, it is likely to interact with receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), and serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6). These receptors are part of the neurotransmitter systems that the molecule's structural features could target.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's potential to modulate ion channels and signaling pathways might relate to genes like KCNH2, which encodes a potassium channel, and CYP enzymes, which are involved in drug metabolism and could be affected by the molecule's structure.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the molecule is potentially related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, and CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). These genes are involved in neurotransmission, signaling pathways, and drug metabolism.
