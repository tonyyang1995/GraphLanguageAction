Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cccc(C)c1-n1c(SCC(=O)NCc2ccco2)nc2ccccc2c1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a complex structure with multiple rings and functional groups, including an indole ring, a phenol group, and a carboxylic acid group. These structural features suggest the molecule could interact with proteins that have binding sites for aromatic compounds and acidic functionalities.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylic acid group and an amide linkage (indicated by the "SCC(=O)" part of the SMILES string) suggests the molecule might be able to form hydrogen bonds and possibly act as a ligand for receptors or enzymes that recognize such functional groups. This could include G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which often bind to molecules containing hydrophobic cores and polar groups like carboxylic acids and amines.
Step 3: Considering the potential interactions of the molecule with GPCRs, we should look for genes encoding GPCRs. From the provided list, several genes are related to GPCRs: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, and SIGMAR1. These genes encode various subtypes of adrenergic, cholinergic, and serotonin receptors, as well as the sigma receptor, all of which are known to interact with small molecules through their extracellular domains.
Step 4: The molecule also has a quinoline-like structure (indicated by "Cc1cccc(C)c1") and a sulfonamide group ("SCC(=O)N"), which are common in drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes. Therefore, it is plausible that this molecule could interact with enzymes encoded by the CYP family of genes, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis and the potential for interaction with GPCRs and CYP enzymes, the related genes from the provided list are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, SIGMAR1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6.
Summary of related genes:
- GPCRs: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, SIGMAR1
- CYP enzymes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6
These genes are likely to be involved in the biological effects of the described molecule due to its structural features and potential pharmacological interactions. Step 1: The molecule contains a complex
