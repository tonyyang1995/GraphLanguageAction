Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CS(=O)(=O)Nc1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc1Oc1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a structure that includes a carboxylic acid group (COOH), an amide group (CON), and a pyrrolidine ring. This pattern suggests the molecule could be a derivative of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) like diclofenac.
Step 2: The presence of the amide and carboxylic acid groups indicates the molecule could have inhibitory effects on enzymes involved in the metabolism of drugs, such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are known to metabolize NSAIDs.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to a nitrogen atom, which could interact with receptors such as HTR2A and HTR2B, which are serotonin receptors.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) and a benzene ring could suggest potential interactions with enzymes like CYP3A4, which metabolizes various drugs including NSAIDs.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and functional groups present, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes involved in drug metabolism and receptor signaling, including CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, HTR2A, and HTR2B.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9
