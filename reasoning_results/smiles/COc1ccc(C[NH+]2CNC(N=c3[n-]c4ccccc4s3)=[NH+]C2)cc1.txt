Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(C[NH+]2CNC(N=c3[n-]c4ccccc4s3)=[NH+]C2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule, which includes a benzene ring, an amide group, and several heterocyclic rings such as pyrrole and imidazole. These structural features suggest that the molecule may interact with proteins involved in signaling pathways or metabolic processes.
Step 2: Among the given genes, several are known to be involved in neurotransmitter transport, receptor function, and signaling cascades, which are often targeted by molecules with similar chemical structures. Genes like HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 encode for various subtypes of serotonin receptors, which are known to bind to ligands that affect mood and behavior.
Step 3: Additionally, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 are enzymes involved in the metabolism of many drugs and xenobiotics, including those that might have interactions with the described molecule due to its complex structure and potential for functional groups such as amides and amines.
Step 4: Furthermore, the presence of a nitrogen atom in the amide group could potentially allow for interactions with other nitrogen-containing compounds, which might include proteins involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which encode dopamine receptors.
Step 5: Given the diverse set of interactions possible based on the molecule's structure, the related genes would likely include those involved in neurotransmitter signaling (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), drug metabolism (CYP2D6, CYP2C19), and GPCR signaling (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4).
