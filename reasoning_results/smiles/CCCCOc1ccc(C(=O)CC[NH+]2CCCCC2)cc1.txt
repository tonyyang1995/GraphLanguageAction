Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCOc1ccc(C(=O)CC[NH+]2CCCCC2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure featuring multiple rings, a benzene ring, and a carboxamide group attached to a pyrrole ring. The presence of a carboxamide group suggests the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes involved in metabolism, such as CYP (cytochrome P450) enzymes. This is relevant to the CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 genes, which encode enzymes that metabolize various drugs.
Step 2: The molecule also contains a quinoline-like structure, which might interact with receptors or ion channels. Specifically, the quinoline ring is known to bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are encoded by genes like DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2) and HTR2A (serotonin receptor 5-HT2A). These receptors play crucial roles in neurotransmission and are involved in various physiological processes.
Step 3: The presence of a pyrrole ring in the molecule could indicate potential interactions with voltage-gated sodium channels, as pyrroles are known to modulate these channels. The KCNH2 gene encodes the hERG potassium channel, which is involved in cardiac repolarization. However, the primary focus here should be on the more likely interactions with receptors.
Step 4: Given the complex structure and the presence of functional groups like the carboxamide, it is plausible that this molecule could affect enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP enzymes. This makes CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 particularly relevant.
Step 5: Considering the possible interactions with GPCRs and the metabolic pathways, the following genes are most likely to be directly or indirectly related to the molecule: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- DRD2
- HTR2A Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure including multiple rings, a benzene ring, and a carboxamide group attached to a pyrrole ring.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, specifically CYP (cytochrome P450) enzymes.
Step 3: The quinoline-like structure in the molecule may interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are encoded by genes like DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2) and HTR2A (serotonin receptor 5-HT2A).
Step 4: The pyrrole ring in the molecule could potentially modulate voltage-gated sodium channels, although this is less likely compared to interactions with GPCRs.
Step 5: Based on the interactions with enzymes and GPCRs, the most relevant genes are CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, and HTR2A.
