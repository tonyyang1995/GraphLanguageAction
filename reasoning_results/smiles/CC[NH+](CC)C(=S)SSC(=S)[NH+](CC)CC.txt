Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC[NH+](CC)C(=S)SSC(=S)[NH+](CC)CC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a quaternary ammonium group (N+), which is often involved in forming hydrogen bonds and can interact with various biological targets, including receptors and transporters. This feature suggests potential interactions with genes encoding for receptors or transporters.
Step 2: The molecule also includes thioether groups (-S-) and sulfonyl groups (-SO2-), which are common in drugs targeting enzymes such as cytochrome P450s (CYPs). These functional groups are particularly relevant to genes coding for CYP enzymes, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a benzene ring and double bonds in the molecule indicates it could be a ligand for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Genes like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which encode dopamine receptors, might be relevant due to their role in neurotransmission.
Step 4: The molecule's overall structure and functional groups suggest it could interact with ion channels and signaling pathways. For example, HTR2A and HTR2B, which encode serotonin receptors, could be related due to the molecule's potential to modulate neurotransmitter activity.
Step 5: Considering the molecule's complexity and functional groups, it may also interact with kinases and other signaling proteins. Genes such as LCK and PTGS1, which encode for LCK kinase and prostaglandin synthase, respectively, could be relevant based on the molecule's potential to affect cellular signaling pathways.
