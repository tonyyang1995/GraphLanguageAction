Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cn1c(=S)[n-]c2c(c1=O)C(C)(C)Cc1ccccc1-2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a thioether group (-S-) which is a characteristic feature of thiols. Thiols are often involved in interactions with proteins that have cysteine residues, such as kinases and receptors.
Step 2: The molecule also has a quinoline-like structure (quinoline ring system), which is known to interact with certain enzymes like CYP2C19 and CYP2C9. These enzymes are involved in the metabolism of various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a benzene ring and a carboxylic acid group suggests potential binding to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other membrane proteins, which are involved in signaling pathways.
Step 4: The molecule's overall structure indicates it could potentially interact with several genes related to drug metabolism and receptor activity, including CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and HTR2A (serotonin receptor).
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes include CYP2C19, CYP2C9, HTR2A, and possibly others involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmission.
Summary of related genes: CYP2C19, CYP2C9, HTR2A. Step 1: The molecule contains a thioether group (-S-), indicating it might interact with proteins containing cysteine residues.
