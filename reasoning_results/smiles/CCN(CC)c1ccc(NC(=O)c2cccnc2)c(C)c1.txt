Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCN(CC)c1ccc(NC(=O)c2cccnc2)c(C)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule has a complex structure that includes a benzene ring, a nitrogen atom, and a cyclic amide group (N-C(=O)-C). This pattern suggests the molecule could be a small organic compound that might interact with proteins involved in various biological processes.
Step 2: Considering the structure, the molecule likely contains functional groups such as hydroxyl (-OH), amine (-NH2), and possibly aromatic groups, which are common in ligands that bind to receptors or enzymes. These functional groups can form hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions, and hydrophobic contacts with proteins.
Step 3: The cyclic amide group in the molecule is particularly relevant because it can act as a ligand for enzymes like cytochrome P450 (CYP) family members. CYP enzymes are involved in the metabolism of many drugs and xenobiotics, and their activity can be influenced by specific chemical structures.
Step 4: Given the potential for the molecule to interact with CYP enzymes, we should focus on genes encoding these enzymes. Among the listed genes, those related to CYP enzymes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These genes encode enzymes that play crucial roles in drug metabolism.
Step 5: Additionally, since the molecule has a nitrogen atom that could potentially participate in hydrogen bonding, it may also interact with ion channels or receptors that have similar binding sites. This could make it relevant to genes like DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2) and HTR2A (serotonin receptor 5-HT2A), which are involved in neurotransmission.
Summary of related gene names: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A. The molecule's structure suggests potential interactions with these genes, primarily through metabolic pathways and neurotransmission. The final list of related genes is CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, DRD2, and HTR2A.
