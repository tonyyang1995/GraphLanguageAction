Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1c(N)c(=O)n(-c2ccccc2)n1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that has a complex structure, including a benzene ring, amide group, and heterocycles such as pyrrole and piperidine. This structure suggests the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: Looking at the functional groups present, the amide group (-CONH-) is particularly noteworthy as it can participate in hydrogen bonding and other interactions with protein targets. Additionally, the presence of nitrogen-containing rings (pyrrole and piperidine) indicates potential for binding to proteins with basic residues.
Step 3: Considering the potential interaction sites on proteins, this molecule might interact with receptors or enzymes that have hydrophobic pockets or charged regions capable of forming hydrogen bonds. Such interactions are common for molecules targeting G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), cytochrome P450 enzymes, and ion channels.
Step 4: Among the provided genes, those encoding for GPCRs, cytochrome P450 enzymes, and ion channels would be the most likely candidates for interaction with the described molecule. Specifically, the genes DRD2, DRD3, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and KCNH2 could be directly influenced by this molecule due to their roles in neurotransmission and ion channel function.
Step 5: The remaining genes listed, such as ABL1, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and others, also encode for enzymes and receptors but are less directly related to the specific functional groups and structural features of the molecule described.
Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2
- DRD3
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- HTR6
- KCNH2
These genes encode proteins that are potential targets for the molecule based on its chemical structure and the types of interactions it may form.
