Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cccc(NC(=O)Nc2ccc(-c3csc4[n-]cnc(=N)c34)cc2)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure including aromatic rings, a nitrogen atom, and a carboxamide group (-CONH). These features suggest it could be a small molecule that interacts with receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH) indicates this molecule might act as an inhibitor or activator of enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize drugs and other xenobiotics. This suggests a potential interaction with genes encoding for these enzymes.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule's structure, particularly the nitrogen-containing heterocycles, could potentially interact with ion channels or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are often targets for drugs affecting neurotransmission. This hints at possible interactions with genes like DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, or KCNH2.
Step 4: The overall structure also does not strongly suggest direct interaction with membrane transporters or kinases, which are encoded by genes such as SLC6A2, SLC6A4, or LCK, respectively.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the most likely related genes are those involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4) and neurotransmission (DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, KCNH2).
