Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)[NH2+]CC(O)c1ccc(NS(C)(=O)=O)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains an amine group (-NH2), which suggests it could be a potential ligand for receptors that interact with amines, such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2). These receptors are involved in the regulation of heart rate, blood pressure, and other physiological processes.
Step 2: The molecule also has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) attached to a carbon atom, indicating it may have acidic properties. This feature might make it relevant to genes associated with ion channels and transporters that interact with acidic compounds, like KCNH2 (a potassium channel) and SLC6A4 (a sodium-dependent neurotransmitter transporter).
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (NS(C)(=O)=O) suggests the molecule could interact with enzymes or receptors that bind to such structures. For instance, CYP2D6, a cytochrome P450 enzyme, metabolizes drugs containing similar functional groups, making this molecule potentially relevant to its function.
Step 4: The molecule includes an ester group (-OC(=O)-), which might allow it to interact with proteins that recognize or bind esters, such as CYP2C9, another cytochrome P450 enzyme, which metabolizes various drugs and xenobiotics containing ester groups.
Step 5: Given the molecular structure, the most likely related genes are those involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), neurotransmitter signaling (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), and ion channel activity (KCNH2, SLC6A4).
Summary of related gene names:
- Drug metabolism: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4
- Neurotransmitter signaling: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4
- Ion channel activity: KCNH2, SLC6A4
Note: The molecule's exact interaction with specific genes would depend on further experimental validation, but these are the most plausible based on the molecular structure provided.
