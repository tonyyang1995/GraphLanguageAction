Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[N+](C)(C)CCOC(=O)CCC(=O)OCC[N+](C)(C)C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains multiple nitrogen atoms, indicating potential for amine or amide interactions. It also has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an ester group (C=O), which are common in ligands that interact with receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of benzene rings and a quaternary ammonium group suggests the molecule could be a ligand for receptors such as GPCRs, which often bind to aromatic residues and positively charged sites.
Step 3: The molecule's structure includes a phenylpiperidine moiety, which is similar to the structure found in many GABA receptor antagonists and may indicate interaction with GABAergic systems.
Step 4: Given the pattern of substituents and functional groups, this molecule might interact with receptors like DRD2 (Dopamine D2 receptor) and HTR2A (Serotonin 5-HT2A receptor), which are known to have binding sites for molecules with similar structures.
Step 5: The related genes include: DRD2, HTR2A.
Summary of related genes: DRD2, HTR2A. Step 1: The molecule contains multiple nitrogen atoms, indicating potential for amine or amide interactions. It also has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an ester group (C=O), which are common in ligands that interact with receptors or enzymes.
