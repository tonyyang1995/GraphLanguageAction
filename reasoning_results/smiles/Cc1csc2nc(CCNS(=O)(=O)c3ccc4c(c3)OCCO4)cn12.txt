Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1csc2nc(CCNS(=O)(=O)c3ccc4c(c3)OCCO4)cn12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule contains several functional groups such as amide (N=C=O), ester (O=C-O), and aromatic rings (c-c). These features suggest the molecule could interact with proteins that have binding sites for similar chemical functionalities.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of an ester group and aromatic rings indicates potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. These enzymes are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics, including those with similar chemical structures.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule's overall structure might allow it to bind to receptors and ion channels. For instance, the amide group could potentially interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like HTR2A, HTR2B, and DRD2, which are known to have binding sites for amine compounds and other small molecules.
Step 4: The presence of a nitro group (N=O) and the overall hydrophobic nature of the molecule might also indicate potential interactions with proteins involved in neurotransmitter transport, such as SLC6A2 and SLC6A4, which are associated with serotonin and dopamine transporters.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions with proteins, the related genes include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, DRD2, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4. These genes encode enzymes involved in drug metabolism and receptors/ion channels that may be directly or indirectly affected by the molecule.
