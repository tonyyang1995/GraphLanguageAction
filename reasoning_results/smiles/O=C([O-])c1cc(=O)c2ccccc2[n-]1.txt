Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with a ketone (O=C), an amide (N-C=O), and a nitro group (-NO2) attached to a benzene ring. The presence of a ketone and an amide suggests that the molecule could be a derivative of an ester or amide. The nitro group is known to have a significant impact on the reactivity and pharmacological properties of molecules.
Step 2: The molecule also contains a negatively charged oxygen atom (O-) and a negatively charged nitrogen atom ([n-]), indicating that it might be an ionizable compound. This property is important for understanding how the molecule interacts with biological systems, particularly with ion channels and receptors.
Step 3: Considering the structure and functional groups present in the molecule, it is likely to interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, neurotransmission, and receptor binding. This includes genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), ion channels, and enzymes that metabolize drugs and neurotransmitters.
Step 4: Specific genes that could be related to this molecule include those encoding for receptors and ion channels, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and KCNH2. Additionally, genes involved in drug metabolism like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 may also be relevant due to the presence of functional groups that can undergo metabolic reactions.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and the identified patterns, the related gene names are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. These genes encode proteins that are potential targets for the described molecule or are involved in its metabolism.
