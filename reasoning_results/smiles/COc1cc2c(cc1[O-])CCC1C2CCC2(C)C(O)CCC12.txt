Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc2c(cc1[O-])CCC1C2CCC2(C)C(O)CCC12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a complex structure with multiple rings and functional groups such as an amide (CO), a carbonyl (C=O), an alcohol (OH), and an ester (O-) group. This indicates that the molecule likely has pharmacological activity and may interact with receptors or enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) suggests that this molecule could potentially act as a ligand for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are known to have carbonyl-containing ligands. GPCRs are involved in various signaling pathways and are targets for many drugs.
Step 3: The molecule also contains an alcohol (OH) group, which could make it a substrate for enzymes like CYP2C19, known for metabolizing alcohol and other hydroxylated compounds. CYP2C19 is part of the cytochrome P450 family and plays a role in drug metabolism.
Step 4: Given the complexity and potential for interactions with multiple receptor types, the molecule might also interact with neurotransmitter receptors such as HTR1A (serotonin 1A receptor) and HTR2A (serotonin 2A receptor). These receptors are involved in various neurological functions and are targets for psychiatric medications.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis and potential pharmacological activities, the molecule is most likely related to the following genes: ABL1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KDR, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
Summary of Related Genes: ABL1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KDR, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
