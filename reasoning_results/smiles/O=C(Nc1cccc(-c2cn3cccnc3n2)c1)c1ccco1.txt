Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Nc1cccc(-c2cn3cccnc3n2)c1)c1ccco1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system and a pyridine ring fused to it, forming a heterocyclic structure. This pattern is characteristic of several drug molecules that interact with receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) and a nitro group (-NO2) suggests potential interaction with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Step 3: The aromatic nature of the molecule and its potential to form hydrogen bonds with proteins indicate possible interactions with receptors like G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are encoded by genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
Step 4: The molecule’s structure also hints at potential effects on ion channels, particularly those involved in neuronal function, such as KCNH2 (hERG potassium channel).
Step 5: Considering the above structural features, the molecule may be related to the following genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system and a pyridine ring fused to it, forming a heterocyclic structure. This pattern is characteristic of several drug molecules that interact with receptors and enzymes.
Step 5: Considering the above structural features, the molecule may be related to the following genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1,
