Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCN(CC)c1ccc(-c2nc3cnccn3c2[NH2+]C2CCCC2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom within a cyclic structure, specifically a pyrrolidine ring, which is part of a larger heterocyclic system. This structural feature is relevant to several genes involved in neurotransmitter systems and receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a primary amine (-NH2) group attached to a carbon chain suggests potential interaction with proteins that have amine-binding sites, such as certain G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The molecule also includes a cyano (-CN) group, which could indicate a potential for interaction with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19.
Step 4: The overall structure, including the amine and cyano groups, may interact with GPCRs like HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are known to bind amines and other small molecules.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C.
Summary of related genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C.
