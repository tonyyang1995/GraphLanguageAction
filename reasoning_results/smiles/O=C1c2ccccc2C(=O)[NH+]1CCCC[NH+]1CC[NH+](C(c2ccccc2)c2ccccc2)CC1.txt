Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C1c2ccccc2C(=O)[NH+]1CCCC[NH+]1CC[NH+](C(c2ccccc2)c2ccccc2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups including an amide, ester, and several aromatic rings. It also contains amine groups which can participate in hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions.
Step 2: Analyzing the structure further, the presence of a quaternary ammonium group (N+) suggests the molecule may be an agonist or inhibitor for receptors that interact with positively charged moieties. This pattern aligns with some of the provided genes, such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are dopamine receptors.
Step 3: The aromatic rings and amide/ester functionalities could indicate the molecule interacts with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4 encode for different subtypes of adrenergic and cholinergic receptors.
Step 4: Given the presence of CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) in the provided list, the molecule might also be metabolized by these enzymes, indicating it could have pharmacological activity that affects their function.
Step 5: Considering the overall structure and the potential interactions with the identified receptors and enzymes, the molecule is likely related to the genes encoding dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), adrenergic and cholinergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), and cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Summary of related genes:
- Dopamine receptors: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4
- Adrenergic and cholinergic receptors: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4
- Cytochrome P450 enzymes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4
These genes are related due to the potential interaction of the molecule with their encoded proteins, either as an agonist, antagonist, or through metabolic pathways. Step 1: The molecule contains multiple functional groups such as amides, esters, and aromatic rings, which are common in drugs that interact with various biological targets.
Step 2: The presence of quaternary ammonium groups (N+) suggests the molecule could interact with positively charged sites on protein receptors, particularly those found in neurotransmitter systems.
Step 3: The aromatic rings and amide/ester functionalities indicate the molecule may bind to and modulate the activity of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are involved in many signaling pathways.
Step 4: The molecule’s structure aligns with known ligands for receptors encoded by genes such as DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2
