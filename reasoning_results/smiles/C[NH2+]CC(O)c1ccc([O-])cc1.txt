Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH2+]CC(O)c1ccc([O-])cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a nitrogen atom with an attached positive charge (NH2+), which indicates it is an amine compound. This functional group is often involved in binding to proteins that have negatively charged residues such as serine or threonine.
Step 2: The molecule contains an amide group (-CONH2) and a carboxylate group (-COO-). These functional groups are common in drugs that interact with receptors or enzymes, as they can form hydrogen bonds or ionic interactions.
Step 3: The presence of a benzene ring with an oxygen atom attached (O-) suggests the molecule could be a phenolic compound. Phenolic compounds can act as ligands for various receptors and ion channels, particularly those involved in neurotransmission.
Step 4: Given the molecular structure, this compound might interact with receptors or enzymes associated with neurotransmitter systems, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or ion channels. Genes like DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 encode for serotonin receptors, while CNR1 encodes for the cannabinoid receptor 1, which is also involved in neurotransmission.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule’s structure may also suggest potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize a wide range of drugs.
