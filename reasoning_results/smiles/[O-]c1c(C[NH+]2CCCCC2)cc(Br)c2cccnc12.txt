Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [O-]c1c(C[NH+]2CCCCC2)cc(Br)c2cccnc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge, which is part of a larger aromatic ring system. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a bromine atom and multiple carbon chains, which could indicate possible interactions with enzymes or receptors that require hydrophobic binding sites.
Step 3: Given the presence of an aromatic nitrogen and the overall molecular complexity, the molecule might interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as those encoded by genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a cyano group (-CN) and aromatic rings might suggest potential interactions with enzymes such as CYP2C9 and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and potential interactions, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. 
Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CYP2C9, CYP2D6. Step 5: Summarized the related gene names.
