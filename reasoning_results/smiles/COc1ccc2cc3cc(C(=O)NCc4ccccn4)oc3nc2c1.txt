Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc2cc3cc(C(=O)NCc4ccccn4)oc3nc2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a tricyclic structure with a pyrrole ring fused to a benzene ring, which is common in many ligands for receptors such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature suggests potential interactions with GPCRs.
Step 2: The presence of a pyrrole ring, specifically the nitrogen atom within it, indicates that this molecule could act as an agonist or antagonist for receptors that have a preference for basic nitrogen atoms in their binding sites. This includes several of the listed genes, such as DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are all involved in GPCR signaling pathways.
Step 3: The molecule also has a carboxamide group (-CONH2), which is often found in ligands for receptors like the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1), which is encoded by the CNR1 gene. The presence of this functional group might suggest potential interaction with this receptor.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) and a cyano (-CN) group in the molecule may indicate interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 5: Based on the structural features identified, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CNR1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4.
