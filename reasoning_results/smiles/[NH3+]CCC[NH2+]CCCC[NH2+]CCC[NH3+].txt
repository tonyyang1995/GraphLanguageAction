Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [NH3+]CCC[NH2+]CCCC[NH2+]CCC[NH3+], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a structure with multiple amine groups (-NH2) and positively charged nitrogen atoms (-NH3+), indicating it is an amine compound with basic properties.
Step 2: The molecular structure contains several carbon chains, suggesting it could be involved in interactions with proteins that have hydrophobic or lipid-binding domains, such as membrane receptors or transporters.
Step 3: The presence of multiple amine groups and positively charged nitrogen atoms might allow for interaction with acidic amino acid residues (such as carboxyl groups) in protein structures, potentially affecting proteins like ion channels or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 4: Considering the structure and charge of the molecule, it may interact with membrane proteins or receptors that have binding sites for basic compounds, such as certain GPCRs, which include some of the listed genes (e.g., CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Step 5: Given the potential for the molecule to interact with membrane proteins and receptors, the following genes are likely to be related: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
Summary of related genes: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6. Step 1: The given molecule has a structure with multiple amine groups (-NH2) and positively charged nitrogen atoms (-NH3+), indicating it is an amine compound with basic properties.
Summary of related genes: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with multiple amine groups and positively charged nitrogen atoms, indicating it is a basic compound.
