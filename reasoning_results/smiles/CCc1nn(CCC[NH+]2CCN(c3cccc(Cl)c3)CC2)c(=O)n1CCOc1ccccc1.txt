Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCc1nn(CCC[NH+]2CCN(c3cccc(Cl)c3)CC2)c(=O)n1CCOc1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is common in many drug-like molecules and can interact with various receptors and enzymes. This structural feature might be relevant to genes involved in signal transduction pathways or drug metabolism.
Step 2: The molecule includes a quinoline moiety, which is known to interact with multiple receptors and transport proteins. This could suggest potential interactions with genes encoding for receptors or transporters such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B) and cholinergic receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 3: The presence of an amide group and a carboxylic acid suggests potential for acetylcholine receptor modulation. This could be relevant to genes encoding acetylcholine receptors, specifically CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 4: The molecule has a cyclic amine structure that might interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Genes such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which encode serotonin receptors, could be related due to this structural feature.
Step 5: The presence of aromatic rings and functional groups could indicate potential for interaction with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are involved in drug metabolism.
Summary of related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
