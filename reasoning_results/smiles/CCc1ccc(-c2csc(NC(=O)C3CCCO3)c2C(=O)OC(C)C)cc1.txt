Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCc1ccc(-c2csc(NC(=O)C3CCCO3)c2C(=O)OC(C)C)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex molecule that includes a tricyclic core with additional functional groups such as esters, amides, and a hydroxyl group. This structure suggests the molecule may have pharmacological activity, particularly targeting receptors or enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of an amide (-CONH-) and ester (-COO-) functionalities in the molecule indicates it could interact with proteins containing catalytic sites for acetylation, methylation, or esterification reactions. This is relevant to genes encoding enzymes involved in these processes.
Step 3: The hydroxyl group (-OH) and the overall size and shape of the molecule suggest potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Specific GPCRs are encoded by genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are known to be involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways.
Step 4: Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, this molecule might also interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs), which are encoded by CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These enzymes play a crucial role in drug metabolism and can influence the efficacy and safety of medications.
Step 5: Considering the interactions with both GPCRs and CYP enzymes, the related genes include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
