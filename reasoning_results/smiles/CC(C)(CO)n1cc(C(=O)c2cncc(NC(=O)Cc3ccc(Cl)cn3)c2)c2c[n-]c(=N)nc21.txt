Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)(CO)n1cc(C(=O)c2cncc(NC(=O)Cc3ccc(Cl)cn3)c2)c2c[n-]c(=N)nc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains several functional groups such as amides, esters, and a cyclic nitrogen-containing moiety, which are common in drug molecules that interact with receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The cyclic nitrogen-containing moiety, along with the amide and ester functionalities, suggest potential interactions with proteins involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways, which are mediated by receptors like adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), cholinergic receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), and serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of aromatic rings and heterocycles, particularly the imidazole ring in the nitrogen-containing moiety, might indicate a possible interaction with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are known to metabolize various drugs.
Step 4: The overall structure also hints at potential binding to ion channels, such as voltage-gated potassium channels (KCNH2) and calcium channels (CACNA1H), which could be relevant for genes like KCNH2.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and the potential interactions with the mentioned proteins and enzymes, the molecule may be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, KCNH2, CACNA1H. Step 1: The molecule contains several functional groups such as amides, esters, and a cyclic nitrogen-containing moiety, which are common in drug molecules that interact with receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The cyclic nitrogen-containing moiety suggests potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), cholinergic receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), and serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Step 3: The aromatic rings and heterocycles, especially the imidazole ring, indicate possible interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, including cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Step 4: The structure also points towards potential binding to ion channels, specifically voltage-gated potassium channels (KCNH2) and calcium channels (CACNA1H).
