Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Fc1ccc2c(CC[NH2+]Cc3cccc(OCC(F)(F)C(F)F)c3)c[nH]c2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a complex structure with multiple functional groups including an amine (NH2+), fluorine atoms (F), and a benzene ring system. The presence of a positively charged amine group suggests the molecule could act as an agonist or inhibitor for receptors that bind to such groups.
Step 2: The amine group (NH2+) is attached to a benzene ring, which is a common feature in many receptor ligands, particularly those targeting G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This pattern aligns well with the structures of some ligands for adrenergic and muscarinic receptors.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a pyrrolidine ring (indicated by CC[NH2+]), which is a characteristic feature of certain GPCR ligands. This structural element is known to interact with various GPCRs, including adrenergic (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4) receptors.
Step 4: Given the complexity and the presence of specific functional groups, this molecule might interact with multiple receptors and enzymes. However, based on the structural analysis, it is most likely to interact with adrenergic and muscarinic receptors due to the presence of the amine group and the pyrrolidine ring.
Step 5: Therefore, the related genes are primarily those encoding adrenergic and muscarinic receptors: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Summary of related gene names:
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- ADRB2
- CHRM1
- CHRM3
- CHRM4 Step 5: Summary of related gene names:
- CHRM4
These genes encode receptors that could potentially interact with the given molecule due to its structural features. The molecule's amine group and benzene ring system suggest it may be a ligand for adrenergic and muscarinic receptors.
