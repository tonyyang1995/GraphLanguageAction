Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Nc1ccc(C(=O)[O-])c([O-])c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a compound that includes a pyrrole ring (Nc1ccc), a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) attached to carbon, and two negatively charged oxygen atoms (-[O-]). This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in ion transport, neurotransmitter regulation, and drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of the carboxylic acid group and negatively charged oxygen atoms indicates that this molecule could act as an inhibitor or modulator of ion channels, particularly those involved in calcium and potassium ions, which are known to be influenced by acidic pH changes and negatively charged ligands.
Step 3: The pyrrole ring and carboxylic acid functional groups are characteristic of molecules that can interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are known targets for drugs affecting neurotransmitter release and signaling pathways, which are regulated by various genes such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and HRH1.
Step 4: Given the molecule's potential to influence ion channels and GPCRs, it may also impact enzymes involved in the metabolism of neurotransmitters and other signaling molecules. This could involve CYP enzymes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which play crucial roles in drug metabolism and could affect the efficacy and toxicity of the molecule.
Step 5: The molecule might also have effects on genes related to inflammation and pain modulation, such as PTGS1 (encoding cyclooxygenase-1, which is involved in prostaglandin synthesis), and OPRK1 (encoding the mu-opioid receptor, which is important in pain perception).
Summary of related gene names: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, PTGS1, OPRK1.
