Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])CCc1nc2ccccc2[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a carbonyl group (O=C) and an amide group (-CONH), which are common in ligands that interact with receptors and enzymes. These functional groups can form hydrogen bonds and other interactions with amino acid residues in protein binding sites.
Step 2: The presence of an aromatic ring (c1nc2ccccc2) suggests potential for π-π stacking interactions with aromatic residues in protein binding sites, which is a common interaction mode for many drugs and ligands.
Step 3: The negatively charged oxygen atom ([O-]) indicates the molecule has a basic character, which may allow it to bind to proteins containing acidic residues or ion channels.
Step 4: Considering the molecular structure, this compound could potentially interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to its size, shape, and charge distribution, as well as with enzymes that have active sites with similar properties.
Step 5: Based on the above structural features, the molecule is likely to be related to genes encoding for GPCRs such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, as well as enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism. 
Summary of related gene names:
- GPCRs: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4
- Enzymes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6
Note: This analysis is based on the molecular structure provided and is not exhaustive; there might be additional genes related to this molecule that were not identified through this process. Additionally, the actual biological activity would need to be experimentally validated.
