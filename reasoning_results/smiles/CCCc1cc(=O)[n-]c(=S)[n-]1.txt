Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCc1cc(=O)[n-]c(=S)[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The SMILES string CCCc1cc(=O)[n-]c(=S)[n-]1 represents a molecule that contains a benzene ring (CCC), an oxadiazole ring (c1cc(=O)), and a thiocyanate group ([n-]c(=S)[n-]1). This structure suggests the molecule may interact with proteins involved in signaling pathways.
Step 2: Analyzing the pattern of the molecule, it includes a thiocyanate group which is often found in ligands for receptors and enzymes. This indicates potential interactions with genes encoding for receptors and enzymes.
Step 3: The presence of an oxadiazole ring and thiocyanate group can suggest potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other membrane-bound proteins, which are encoded by genes such as DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes encode for dopamine receptors and serotonin receptors, respectively.
Step 4: Given the thiocyanate group, there could also be interactions with enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) due to their role in metabolizing various drugs and xenobiotics. This suggests potential relationships with CYP-related genes.
Step 5: The benzene ring in the molecule could potentially interact with other aromatic residues in protein binding sites, which might relate to genes such as ABL1, CDK2, and LCK, which encode kinases.
Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6 (for GPCRs)
- CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 (for drug metabolism)
- ABL1, CDK2, LCK (for kinases) Step 1: The molecule has a benzene ring (CCC) and a thiocyanate group ([n-]c(=S)[n-]1), indicating potential interactions with proteins involved in cellular processes.
Step 2: The thiocyanate group is commonly found in ligands for receptors, suggesting possible interactions with receptor-encoding genes.
Step 3: The oxadiazole ring (c1cc(=O)) in the molecule may indicate interactions with enzymes or receptors, particularly those involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 4: The thiocyanate group could also suggest potential interactions with enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 5: Summary of related genes: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, ABL1, CDK2, LCK.
