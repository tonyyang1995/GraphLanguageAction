Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N=c1[n-]c(=S)c2[n-]cnc2[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure that includes a nitrogen atom double-bonded to a carbon atom, which is part of a larger ring system. This pattern is characteristic of molecules that can interact with various receptors and enzymes, particularly those involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of sulfur atoms in the molecule suggests it could be involved in forming thioether bonds, which are common in ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as adrenergic and muscarinic receptors, and in some cases, may also interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19.
Step 3: The overall structure of the molecule, including its aromatic rings and heteroatoms, is similar to molecules that can act as agonists or antagonists at various GPCRs, which are encoded by genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes encode receptors that respond to neurotransmitters like adrenaline, noradrenaline, acetylcholine, and serotonin.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure could potentially interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are encoded by the corresponding genes. These enzymes play a crucial role in the biotransformation of drugs and other xenobiotics, which might influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the molecule.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to have interactions with several genes related to neurotransmission and drug metabolism. The related gene names include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. 
Summary of Related Gene Names:
- ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2
- CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4
These genes are associated with neurotransmitter receptors and drug-metabolizing enzymes, respectively.
