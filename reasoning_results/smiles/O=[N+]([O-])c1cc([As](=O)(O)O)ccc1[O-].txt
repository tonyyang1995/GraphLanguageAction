Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=[N+]([O-])c1cc([As](=O)(O)O)ccc1[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups including an amide (N=O), an ester (C=O), and an aromatic ring system. The presence of these functional groups suggests that the molecule could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction, metabolism, and receptor binding.
Step 2: Notably, the molecule contains an arylsulfonate group (-SO3-) which is a common pharmacophore found in drugs targeting G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This group is likely to be involved in interactions with membrane-bound receptors such as adrenergic and muscarinic receptors.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a pyridine ring, which is often found in ligands for various receptor types, particularly those involved in neurotransmission. This feature might indicate potential interactions with receptors like D2 dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), which are known to have pyridine-containing ligands.
Step 4: Given the presence of an amide and ester group, the molecule may also interact with enzymes such as CYP2D6, which metabolizes many drugs through oxidation reactions involving amides and esters.
Step 5: Based on the structural features identified, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2D6, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2D6, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
