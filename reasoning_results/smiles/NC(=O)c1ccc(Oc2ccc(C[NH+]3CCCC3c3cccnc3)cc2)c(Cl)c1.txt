Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NC(=O)c1ccc(Oc2ccc(C[NH+]3CCCC3c3cccnc3)cc2)c(Cl)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with a central nitrogen atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom (amide group), suggesting it is likely a drug-like compound that could interact with proteins such as enzymes or receptors. This amide group is common in molecules that are substrates for cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are encoded by genes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
Step 2: The molecule also contains an aromatic ring system (benzene rings) connected to various functional groups including an alcohol group (-OH) and a substituted benzene ring containing a chlorine atom. These features suggest the molecule might be metabolized by enzymes involved in phase I metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a benzene ring and a quaternary ammonium group (N+), as well as a cyclic structure with nitrogen atoms, indicates potential interactions with ion channels or receptors. For instance, the cyclic structure with nitrogen atoms could be indicative of a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), which is encoded by genes like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, among others.
Step 4: The molecule’s overall complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups suggest it may have diverse biological activities, potentially interacting with several different types of proteins. This broad interaction profile is characteristic of drugs that target multiple signaling pathways, which can be influenced by genes involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is most likely to be related to the genes encoding for enzymes involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and those encoding for GPCRs and other receptors involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
