Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)[NH2+]CC(O)COc1cccc2[nH]c3ccccc3c12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a nitrogen atom bearing a positive charge (NH2+), indicating potential interaction with proteins that have positively charged binding sites. This structural feature suggests possible interactions with receptors or enzymes that have similar binding preferences.
Step 2: The presence of an ester group (CC(O)) and a carboxylic acid group (CO) in the molecule could indicate potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism or signaling pathways, such as those encoded by CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a pyrrole ring system (c1cccc2[nH]c3ccccc3c12), which might interact with proteins containing aromatic amino acid residues, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This could be relevant to genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which encode for various subtypes of GPCRs.
Step 4: The molecule’s overall structure, including its hydrophobic and polar regions, may allow it to bind to proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, such as those encoded by HRH1 and PTGS1. These genes play roles in hormone receptor activity and prostaglandin synthesis, respectively.
Step 5: Given the diverse functional groups and overall structure, the molecule may interact with multiple genes involved in neurotransmitter systems, including DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which encode dopamine receptors, and ESR1, which encodes an estrogen receptor.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HRH1, PTGS1, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, ESR1.
