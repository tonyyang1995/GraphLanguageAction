Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCSc1ccc2[n-]c(=NC(=O)OC)[n-]c2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a tricyclic structure with a central benzene ring, which is common in many drugs that interact with receptors and ion channels.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the tricyclic structure suggests it could be an amine or similar functional group, which often binds to receptors such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or ion channels.
Step 3: The nitrogen atoms with negative charges indicate the molecule might have a significant electrostatic interaction capability, which is crucial for binding to negatively charged sites on receptor proteins like GPCRs.
Step 4: Given the molecular structure, this compound could potentially interact with GPCRs, specifically those involved in neurotransmission and hormone signaling, such as DRD2 (Dopamine Receptor D2), HTR1A (Serotonin Receptor 1A), and HRH1 (Histamine Receptor H1).
Step 5: The molecule may also have affinity for enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, due to its complex structure.
Related gene names:
- DRD2
- HTR1A
- HRH1
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
These genes are directly related to the potential interactions of the described molecule based on its structural characteristics. Other genes listed might not have a direct relationship unless further biochemical studies confirm their involvement.
