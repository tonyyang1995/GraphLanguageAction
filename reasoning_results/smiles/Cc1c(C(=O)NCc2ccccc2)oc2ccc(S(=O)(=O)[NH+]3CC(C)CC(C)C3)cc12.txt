Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1c(C(=O)NCc2ccccc2)oc2ccc(S(=O)(=O)[NH+]3CC(C)CC(C)C3)cc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex molecule that includes a benzene ring, a pyrrole ring, and various functional groups such as amide, sulfonate ester, and a positively charged nitrogen. This structure suggests potential interactions with receptors or enzymes involved in signal transduction and metabolism.
Step 2: Analyzing the functional groups, the amide group could interact with proteins containing amine-binding sites, while the sulfonate ester might be recognized by enzymes or receptors with specific binding pockets for this functional group. The positively charged nitrogen indicates potential interactions with negatively charged molecules like nucleic acids or anionic sites on proteins.
Step 3: Considering the genes provided, several are known to encode proteins involved in neurotransmitter signaling (e.g., DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), which often have binding sites for small molecules including amides and positively charged groups. Additionally, some genes encode enzymes involved in drug metabolism (e.g., CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Step 4: Given the molecular structure and its functional groups, the molecule is most likely to interact with genes encoding proteins involved in neurotransmitter signaling and drug metabolism. These include: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. These genes are primarily associated with neurotransmitter signaling and drug metabolism pathways.
