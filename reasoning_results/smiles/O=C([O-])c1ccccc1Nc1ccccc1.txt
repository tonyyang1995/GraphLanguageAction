Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])c1ccccc1Nc1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a central carbon atom double-bonded to a carbonyl group (O=C), which is connected to a negatively charged oxygen atom (O-). This part of the molecule suggests it could be an electrophilic or nucleophilic reagent, potentially interacting with enzymes or receptors that have specific binding sites for such functional groups.
Step 2: Adjacent to the carbonyl group is a cyclic structure (c1ccccc1) that resembles a benzene ring, which is known to interact with aromatic amino acids and other molecules through pi-pi stacking or hydrogen bonding. This feature might suggest interactions with proteins that have hydrophobic or aromatic residues in their active sites, such as certain G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The cyclic structure is also attached to a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (Nc1ccccc1), which is common in ligands that bind to various receptors, including GPCRs. This nitrogen could form hydrogen bonds or act as a basic site for protonation, indicating potential interactions with acidic residues in protein binding sites.
Step 4: Given the presence of multiple functional groups (such as the carbonyl, aromatic ring, and amine) and the overall structure resembling a small molecule inhibitor or agonist for GPCRs, this molecule could be related to several genes encoding GPCRs, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and KDR.
Step 5: Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KDR. These genes encode GPCRs that could potentially interact with the described molecule due to its structural features.
