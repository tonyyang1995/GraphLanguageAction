Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(Cl)cc1N1CC[NH+](C(=O)C2(S(=O)(=O)c3ccc(Cl)cc3)CC2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this might be important.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is characteristic of many drug molecules that interact with receptors or enzymes. This structure may suggest potential interactions with genes involved in receptor signaling or drug metabolism.
Step 2: The molecule also has a quinoline-like structure with a nitrogen atom bearing a positive charge. This feature indicates it could be an agonist or modulator of receptors, particularly G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are often regulated by such molecules.
Step 3: The presence of a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) is notable, as these functional groups are commonly found in drugs targeting enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYP enzymes). Several genes listed, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, encode enzymes that metabolize drugs.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule includes a pyrrolidine ring, which is sometimes used in ligands for receptors involved in neurotransmission, such as those targeted by HTR (serotonin receptors) and DRD (dopamine receptors).
Step 5: Based on the molecular features identified, the molecule is likely to have interactions with genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6) and receptors involved in neurotransmission (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4).
