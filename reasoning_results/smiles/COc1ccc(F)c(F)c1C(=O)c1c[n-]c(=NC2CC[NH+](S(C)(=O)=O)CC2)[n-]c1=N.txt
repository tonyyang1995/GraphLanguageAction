Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(F)c(F)c1C(=O)c1c[n-]c(=NC2CC[NH+](S(C)(=O)=O)CC2)[n-]c1=N, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule contains several functional groups and structural features that are indicative of its potential interaction with certain receptors or enzymes. Notably, it includes a phenyl ring system, a carboxamide group (-CONH2), and fluorine substituents, which are common in small molecules that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of the carboxamide group and the overall molecular structure suggest that this compound could potentially interact with GPCRs involved in neurotransmitter signaling, such as those that modulate dopamine and serotonin pathways. This is supported by the fluorine-substituted aromatic rings, which are often used to enhance binding affinity to receptor sites.
Step 3: Given the detailed structure, particularly the amide group and the nitrogen-containing heterocycles, this molecule might also interact with enzymes like CYP2D6, known for metabolizing various drugs including those affecting neurotransmission. Additionally, the presence of an imidazole ring (in the [n-]c1=N part) suggests possible interactions with enzymes containing histidine residues in their active sites.
Step 4: The molecule's structure aligns well with known ligands for receptors involved in GABAergic and dopaminergic signaling, such as DRD2, DRD3, and HTR2A, which regulate mood, reward, and movement. The fluorine atoms and the overall size and shape of the molecule could fit into the binding pockets of these receptors.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related genes include: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2D6, and possibly others involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmission pathways.
