Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C1NC(=O)c2cc(Nc3ccc(F)cc3)c(Nc3ccc(F)cc3)cc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this relationship might be clinically significant.
Step 1: The molecule has a central carbon atom double-bonded to a carbonyl oxygen, with a nitroimidazole ring attached to it. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of multiple fluorine atoms (-F) on the molecule indicates that it may have specific binding sites for certain receptors or transporters, such as those found in G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The molecule contains a benzene ring, which is a common feature in many drugs and can interact with various proteins, including those encoded by the CYP family of genes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: The presence of amide groups and amines in the molecule could suggest interactions with neurotransmitter receptors, such as those encoded by the HTR and DRD families of genes.
Step 5: Given the structural features mentioned, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmission, including CYP2D6, CYP2C19, HTR1A, HTR2A, and DRD2.
