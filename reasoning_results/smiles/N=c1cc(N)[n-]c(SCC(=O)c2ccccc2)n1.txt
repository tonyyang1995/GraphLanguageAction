Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N=c1cc(N)[n-]c(SCC(=O)c2ccccc2)n1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound that includes a nitrogen atom double-bonded to a carbon (N=c), a pyridine ring, an amide group (-SCC(=O)-), and multiple nitrogen-containing heterocycles. This structure suggests potential interactions with receptors or enzymes that have similar chemical functionalities.
Step 2: The presence of a pyridine ring and amide group indicates that this molecule could potentially interact with proteins such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes like cytochrome P450 (CYP) family members, which are known to metabolize drugs and other xenobiotics.
Step 3: Among the listed genes, those involved in GPCR signaling pathways, drug metabolism, and neurotransmitter systems are most likely to be affected by this molecule. These include ADRB2 (beta-adrenergic receptor 2), DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), HTR2A (serotonin receptor 5-HT2A), CYP2D6 (cytochrome P450 2D6), and CYP3A4 (cytochrome P450 3A4).
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of amide groups and nitrogen heterocycles might also suggest interactions with ion channels, such as KCNH2 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2), which is not directly listed but could be relevant if the molecule affects potassium currents.
Step 5: Therefore, the related genes to this molecule are ADRB2, DRD2, HTR2A, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and KCNH2.
