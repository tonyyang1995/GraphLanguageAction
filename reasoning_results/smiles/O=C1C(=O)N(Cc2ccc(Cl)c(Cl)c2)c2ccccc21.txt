Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C1C(=O)N(Cc2ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c2)c2ccccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this is relevant.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with multiple substituents, including a chlorine atom, a methyl group, and a cyano group. This structural pattern suggests the molecule may interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways or ion channels.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) is characteristic of molecules that can act as inhibitors or modulators of various enzymes and receptors, particularly those involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways. This indicates potential interaction with genes encoding GPCRs.
Step 3: The molecule's structure includes a quinoline-like moiety, which is often found in compounds that inhibit CYP enzymes, specifically CYP2D6 and CYP2C9. These enzymes are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: The molecule also has a benzothiazole ring, which is known to interact with receptors and enzymes such as those encoded by DRD2, HTR1A, and HTR2A, which are involved in neurotransmission.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to genes encoding GPCRs (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), and neurotransmitter receptors (DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A).
Related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with multiple substituents, including a chlorine atom, a methyl group, and a cyano group. This structural pattern suggests the molecule may interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways or ion channels.
