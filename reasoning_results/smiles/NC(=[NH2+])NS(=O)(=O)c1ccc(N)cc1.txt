Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NC(=[NH2+])NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a molecule that contains a nitroso group (-N=N-), an amide group (-CONH2), and a benzene ring system. The presence of these functional groups suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in neurotransmission, signal transduction, and drug metabolism.
Step 2: The nitroso group and amide group are typical moieties for compounds that interact with receptors and transporters. For example, they can form hydrogen bonds or interact with hydrophobic pockets of proteins, which may be relevant to genes encoding receptors or transporters.
Step 3: Given the presence of a benzene ring, this molecule could potentially interact with proteins containing aromatic residues in their binding sites. This feature might be particularly relevant to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as those encoded by genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
Step 4: The molecule also has a quaternary ammonium salt functionality (N+), which can form ion channels or interact with enzymes involved in metabolism. This may relate to genes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, which encode enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is most likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. These genes are associated with neurotransmitter receptors and drug-metabolizing enzymes, respectively. 
Summary of Related Genes:
- ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4
These genes are involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism, which aligns with the molecule's structural features. Other genes listed do not have a direct structural relationship with the molecule based on the given information.
