Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCc1ccc(NC=[NH+]O)c(C)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The SMILES string provided (CCCCc1ccc(NC=[NH+]O)c(C)c1) represents a chemical compound that includes a benzene ring with a substituted nitrogen atom bearing an amide group and a positively charged amine group. This molecular structure suggests potential interactions with receptors or enzymes that are known to bind to or be influenced by similar functional groups.
Step 2: Considering the pattern of the molecule, it contains a nitrogen atom with a positively charged amine group (N[+]) and an amide group (-CO-NH-), which are characteristic of ligands that can interact with various receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and metabolism. These functional groups are key in binding to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Step 3: GPCRs such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) are known to bind small molecules with similar functional groups. The positively charged amine and amide groups could potentially interact with the hydrophobic and hydrophilic pockets of these receptors, modulating their activity.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure might also influence the activity of enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are involved in drug metabolism. The presence of a nitrogen atom and a positively charged amine could alter the substrate specificity and activity of these enzymes.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes would include those involved in neurotransmission (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) and drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Summary of related gene names:
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- ADRB2
- DRD2
- DRD3
- DRD4
- CYP1A2
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
These genes are directly or indirectly related to the molecule due to their roles in receptor binding and enzyme function.
