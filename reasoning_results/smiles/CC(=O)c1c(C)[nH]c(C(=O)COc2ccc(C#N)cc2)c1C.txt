Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(=O)c1c(C)[nH]c(C(=O)COc2ccc(C#N)cc2)c1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other type of explanation.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with an amide group and a cyano group. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule indicates possible interactions with receptors, particularly those involved in neurotransmission. This is relevant to genes like DRD2, HTR2A, and HTR2B, which encode dopamine and serotonin receptors.
Step 3: The molecule has a pyrimidine ring, which could interact with DNA-binding proteins or transcription factors. This is pertinent to genes such as ESR1, which encodes an estrogen receptor.
Step 4: The presence of a phenyl ring and an acetyl group may indicate potential binding to ion channels, making genes like KCNH2, which encodes a potassium channel, relevant.
Step 5: The overall structure does not strongly suggest direct interaction with kinases, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), or nuclear receptors beyond the previously mentioned ones.
