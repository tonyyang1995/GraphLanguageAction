Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+](Cc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1N)C1CCCCC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with a central nitrogen atom (N) that is positively charged ([NH+]), indicating it could be an amine or amide derivative. This feature suggests potential interactions with receptors that bind to such functional groups, particularly those containing amino acids.
Step 2: The molecule also contains several aromatic rings, including benzene rings (indicated by the 'c' notation), which are common in drugs targeting enzymes involved in drug metabolism. For example, cytochrome P450 enzymes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 have active sites that interact with aromatic substrates.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule has a tricyclic structure with multiple substituents, including bromine atoms. Such structures can mimic neurotransmitters or act as ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are involved in signaling pathways and are targeted by drugs such as those listed under DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 4: The presence of a cyclic structure with multiple substituents also indicates potential binding to ion channels, like KCNH2, which is a member of the potassium channel subfamily H. This could influence the ion flux through these channels, affecting their function.
Step 5: Considering the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2. These genes encode proteins involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmission, which are directly influenced by the molecule's structure. 
Summary of Related Genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2.
