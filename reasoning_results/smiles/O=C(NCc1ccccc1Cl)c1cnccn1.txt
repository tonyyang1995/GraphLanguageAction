Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(NCc1ccccc1Cl)c1cnccn1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with a central part consisting of a benzene ring (c1ccccc1) connected to a nitrogen atom (N), which in turn is linked to a chloroethylamine group (-Cl-c). This structure suggests the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors that interact with aromatic compounds or have a nitrogen-containing functional group.
Step 2: Analyzing the structure further, the presence of a nitro group (N=) and a chloroethylamine moiety could indicate potential interactions with enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize drugs containing these functional groups. These enzymes are involved in phase I metabolism and could be directly affected by the molecule's structure.
Step 3: The benzene ring and its substituents might also suggest potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like DRD2, DRD3, or DRD4, which are known to bind to various ligands including aromatic molecules. The chloroethylamine group could enhance binding affinity to these receptors due to its lipophilic nature.
Step 4: Given the complexity and specific functional groups present in the molecule, it is plausible that this compound could influence the expression or activity of multiple genes involved in neurotransmitter signaling pathways, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode for serotonin receptors. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that interacts with several aromatic compounds, and the molecule’s structure aligns well with the binding preferences of these receptors.
Step 5: Additionally, the presence of a nitro group and the overall chemical profile of the molecule may also suggest potential interactions with kinases like LCK, which are involved in signal transduction pathways, or with other enzymes such as CYP3A4, which plays a role in drug metabolism and could be inhibited by the molecule.
