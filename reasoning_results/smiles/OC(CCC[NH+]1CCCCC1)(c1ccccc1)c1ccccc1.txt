Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: OC(CCC[NH+]1CCCCC1)(c1ccccc1)c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring and several substituents such as alkyl chains, a pyridine ring, and an amide group. The presence of these functional groups suggests that the molecule could interact with receptors or enzymes that have similar chemical properties.
Step 2: Analyzing the chemical structure, it includes an amide group (-CONH-), which is known to be involved in binding to proteins, particularly those that are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or enzymes. This indicates potential interactions with genes encoding for receptors or enzymes that contain amine or amide binding sites.
Step 3: The molecule also contains aromatic rings, which can form hydrogen bonds and π-π stacking interactions with other molecules. These interactions are significant for binding to proteins like receptors and ion channels, which often have hydrophobic pockets and aromatic residues.
Step 4: Considering the specific genes provided, the molecule's structure aligns well with potential interactions with genes encoding for GPCRs and enzymes, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which all encode for receptors that can bind small molecules through their amine or amide groups.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule might interact with CYP enzymes like CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, given the presence of substituents that could serve as substrates for these cytochrome P450 enzymes. This interaction would be mediated through the catalytic site of the enzyme.
