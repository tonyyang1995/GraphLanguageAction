Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)(C)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(NC(=O)c2cc(-c3ccccc3)nc3ccccc23)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure including a benzene ring, an amide group (-CONH-), and a nitroso group (NS(=O)). These functional groups suggest the molecule could be involved in interactions with receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of the benzene ring, which is often found in ligands that bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), indicates potential interaction with receptors like adrenergic and cholinergic receptors. This is supported by the amide group, which is common in ligands for these types of receptors.
Step 3: The nitroso group (NS(=O)) is typically associated with molecules that can interact with enzymes such as CYP enzymes, which are known to metabolize drugs and other xenobiotics.
Step 4: Given the structural features, the molecule may interact with genes encoding for receptors and enzymes mentioned above, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. It might also interact with genes encoding for enzymes like PTGS1, which is involved in prostaglandin synthesis.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule might have an impact on genes involved in neurotransmitter systems, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, due to its potential to act as a ligand for these receptors.
