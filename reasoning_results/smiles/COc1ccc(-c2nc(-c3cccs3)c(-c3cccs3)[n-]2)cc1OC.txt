Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(-c2nc(-c3cccs3)c(-c3cccs3)[n-]2)cc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with multiple functional groups including a benzene ring, a pyridine ring, and a carboxylic acid group. These structural elements suggest that the molecule could interact with proteins involved in neurotransmission or signaling pathways due to its potential to bind to receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: Analyzing the pattern of the molecule, it contains aromatic rings and heteroatoms (such as nitrogen and oxygen), which are common in ligands that can bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other membrane-bound proteins. This structural feature indicates a possible interaction with receptors that have similar binding sites.
Step 3: Considering the specific genes listed, several are known to encode receptors or enzymes that could potentially interact with a molecule like the one described. For instance, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 are serotonin receptors, while DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4 are dopamine receptors. These receptors often have binding sites for ligands containing aromatic rings and heteroatoms.
Step 4: Additionally, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 are enzymes involved in drug metabolism, and their active sites typically include hydrophobic and polar regions that can accommodate molecules with similar structural characteristics as the one described.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and the gene features, the related genes include: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2D6, and CYP2C19.
