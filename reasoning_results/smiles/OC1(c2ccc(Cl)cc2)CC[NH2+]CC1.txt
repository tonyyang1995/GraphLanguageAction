Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: OC1(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)CC[NH2+]CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a benzene ring system with a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to it. This structure is common in many drugs that interact with receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The molecule also contains a pyrrolidine ring, which is known to be involved in binding to various types of receptors, particularly G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This ring structure could potentially interact with GPCRs encoded by genes such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
Step 3: The presence of an amide group (-NHCO-) suggests that the molecule might have affinity for proteins containing amino acid sequences that form hydrogen bonds or other interactions with amides, such as enzymes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: The molecule's overall structure, including the benzene rings and amide group, could indicate potential interaction with ion channels or transporters, possibly affecting genes like KCNH2, which encodes a potassium channel.
Step 5: Given the pattern of the molecule and its functional groups, it is most likely to interact with genes encoding receptors and enzymes, specifically those involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism. The related genes include: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, KCNH2. Step 5: Summary of Related Genes: The molecule is most likely to be related to the following genes: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and KCNH2. These genes are involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism, which aligns with the structural features of the molecule.
