Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=S(=O)(c1ccccc1)c1cnc2c(N3CC[NH2+]CC3)cccc2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) and a benzene ring, which are common features in many drugs that interact with receptors and enzymes. The presence of these functional groups suggests that the molecule could potentially interact with proteins involved in signal transduction or enzymatic activity.
Step 2: Looking at the gene list provided, several genes encode for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), enzymes, and drug targets such as CYP enzymes. The sulfonyl group is particularly relevant to the function of some CYP enzymes, specifically CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are known to metabolize various drugs containing this functional group.
Step 3: The benzene ring in the molecule may also be significant. Benzene rings are often found in ligands that bind to receptor proteins like adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B) and dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4). These receptors play crucial roles in neurotransmission and are involved in various physiological processes.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a nitro group (N3) in the molecule could indicate potential interactions with enzymes such as cytochrome P450 (CYP3A4), which can metabolize compounds with this functional group. This further supports the molecule's possible interaction with CYP enzymes.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is most likely to be related to the following genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
