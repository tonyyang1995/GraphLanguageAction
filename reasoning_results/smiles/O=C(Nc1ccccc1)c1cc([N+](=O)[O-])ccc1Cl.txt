Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Nc1ccccc1)c1cc([N+](=O)[O-])ccc1Cl, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a structure that includes a pyrrole ring fused to a benzene ring, and contains an amide group (-CONH) attached to a nitrogen atom within the benzene ring. This structure is characteristic of molecules that interact with certain receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmission or metabolism.
Step 2: Considering the structure and functional groups present, the molecule may interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are known to have binding sites for ligands containing aromatic rings and amide functionalities. The presence of a chlorine atom (-Cl) also suggests potential interaction with enzymes involved in phase I metabolism such as cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Step 3: The presence of a benzene ring and amide group could indicate potential interactions with receptors like adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) or dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), which often have similar binding motifs.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure could suggest potential interactions with enzymes like CYP2D6, which metabolizes many drugs including those affecting neurotransmitter systems.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and potential interactions, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2D6.
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2D6.
