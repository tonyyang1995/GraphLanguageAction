Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1onc(-c2ccccc2Cl)c1C(=O)NCc1ccco1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule containing multiple functional groups such as amide (-CO-N), aromatic ring systems (cyclohexane-like structures), and a chloroalkyl group (-Cl). This structure suggests the molecule could have diverse biological activities, including interactions with various receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: Analyzing the pattern of the molecule, it includes an amide group (-CO-N) which is often found in ligands that bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other protein targets. Additionally, the presence of aromatic rings might indicate potential binding to enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYPs) involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: Considering the potential for interaction with GPCRs, the molecule may relate to genes encoding for receptors such as DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), HTR1A (Serotonin receptor 1A), HTR2A (Serotonin receptor 2A), HTR2B (Serotonin receptor 2B), HTR2C (Serotonin receptor 2C), CHRM1 (Cholinergic receptor muscarinic M1), CHRM3 (Cholinergic receptor muscarinic M3), and CHRM4 (Cholinergic receptor muscarinic M4).
Step 4: Given the presence of a chloroalkyl group and considering metabolic pathways, the molecule might also interact with genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6. These genes are associated with neurotransmitter signaling and drug metabolism.
