Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a carboxamide group attached, which suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism and signaling pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a fluorinated phenol group indicates that the molecule may have specific binding affinity for receptors or enzymes that recognize aromatic compounds with fluorine substitutions.
Step 3: The structure includes a cyclic amide and a pyrrolidine ring, which are common in ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly those involved in neurotransmission and hormone signaling.
Step 4: The molecule’s overall structure hints at possible interactions with enzymes such as CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize drugs and other small molecules containing similar functional groups.
Step 5: Based on the structural features, the molecule may be related to several genes involved in neurotransmission and metabolism, including DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.
