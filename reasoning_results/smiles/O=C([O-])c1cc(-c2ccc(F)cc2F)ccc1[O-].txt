Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])c1cc(-c2ccc(F)cc2F)ccc1[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that contains a carboxylic acid group (O=C([O-])) and multiple fluorine atoms (-F). This structure suggests the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors involved in signal transduction or ion transport.
Step 2: The presence of the carboxylic acid group (O=C([O-])) indicates potential interaction with proton pumps or other ion channels. Among the listed genes, HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A), HTR2B (serotonin receptor 2B), and HTR2C (serotonin receptor 2C) are G-protein coupled receptors that interact with serotonin, which could be influenced by a molecule with a carboxylic acid group.
Step 3: The fluorine atoms (-F) in the molecule may indicate the molecule interacts with proteins containing fluorine-binding sites or contributes to the molecule's lipophilicity, which could affect its binding to membrane proteins such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) or muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 4: The overall structure does not directly suggest interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) based on the provided SMILES string, as there are no aromatic rings or other typical substrates for these enzymes present.
Step 5: Given the structure and properties described, the most likely related genes are those involved in neurotransmitter signaling (HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C) and adrenergic signaling (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) due to the presence of a carboxylic acid group and fluorine atoms.
Summary of related gene names:
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- ADRB2
These genes are involved in serotonin and adrenergic signaling pathways, which align with the molecule's potential to interact with receptors and ion channels.
