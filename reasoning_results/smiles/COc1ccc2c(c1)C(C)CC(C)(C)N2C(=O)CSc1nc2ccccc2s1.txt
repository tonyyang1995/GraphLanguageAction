Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc2c(c1)C(C)CC(C)(C)N2C(=O)CSc1nc2ccccc2s1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound, containing multiple functional groups such as a carboxylic acid (-COOH), amide (C(=O)N), benzene rings, and a sulfonamide group (NS). These structural features suggest the molecule could interact with proteins that have binding sites for these functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and a carboxylic acid suggests this molecule might be a ligand or substrate for enzymes or receptors involved in signaling pathways, which often have specific binding pockets for aromatic compounds and acidic groups.
Step 3: The sulfonamide group indicates potential interactions with enzymes that metabolize such compounds, like cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are known to metabolize sulfonamides and other drugs.
Step 4: Given the presence of amide bonds and the overall complexity of the molecule, it could potentially interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or ion channels, which are often targets for drugs due to their role in signal transduction and ion transport. This would include genes like DRD2, HTR2A, HRH1, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and CNR1.
Step 5: Considering the pharmacophore-like structure of the molecule, it may also interact with kinases, particularly those involved in cell signaling and proliferation, such as LCK, CDK2, and PTGS1 (COX-2).
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- DRD2
- HTR2A
- HRH1
- CHRM1
- CHRM3
- CHRM4

Note: The genes listed are based on the chemical structure and potential interactions, but actual biological relevance would require further experimental validation. Other genes were not directly related to the molecular structure described.
