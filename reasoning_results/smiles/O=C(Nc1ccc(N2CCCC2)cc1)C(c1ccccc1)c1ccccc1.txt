Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Nc1ccc(N2CCCC2)cc1)C(c1ccccc1)c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule provided has a complex structure that includes multiple rings and functional groups such as carbonyls (C=O), nitrogens (N), and aromatic rings. Notably, the molecule contains a pyrrole ring, which is part of the nitrogen-containing heterocyclic structure.
Step 2: One key feature of this molecule is the presence of a quinolone-like structure, which is commonly found in drugs that interact with DNA topoisomerases. This type of structure is often associated with drugs targeting genes involved in cancer therapy and cell cycle regulation.
Step 3: Given the presence of a quinolone-like moiety and considering the list of genes provided, the most relevant genes would be those involved in cancer and cell cycle regulation. Specifically, the genes CDK2 (cell division control protein kinase 2) and MCL1 (myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1) are likely candidates due to their roles in cell proliferation and survival.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure might also suggest potential interactions with genes involved in neurotransmitter systems, given the presence of nitrogen atoms and possible amine functionalities. However, without more detailed analysis, it is less certain how directly these features relate to the listed genes.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names based on the structure and potential biological activities of the molecule, the most relevant genes are: CDK2 and MCL1. 
List of related genes: 
- CDK2
- MCL1 Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names based on the structure and potential biological activities of the molecule, the most relevant genes are: CDK2 and MCL1. 
List of related genes:
- MCL1
