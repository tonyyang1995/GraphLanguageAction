Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CNC(=O)c1cc(Oc2ccc(NC(=O)c3cccc(C(F)(F)F)c3)cc2)ccn1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that includes functional groups such as amides (N=C=O), phenyl rings (c1cc...c1), and substituted aromatic systems (Oc2ccc(NC(=O)...). This structure suggests potential interactions with receptors or enzymes involved in signal transduction or metabolism.
Step 2: Analyzing the molecule for pharmacophoric features, it contains amine and carboxamide functionalities which are common in ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels. The presence of fluorinated groups (F) could indicate modulation of protein-protein interactions or enzyme activities through steric or electronic effects.
Step 3: Considering the genes listed, those primarily involved in GPCR signaling pathways include DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes encode dopamine and serotonin receptors, respectively, which often interact with molecules containing amine and carboxamide groups.
Step 4: The molecule’s ability to potentially modulate ion channels (e.g., KCNH2) or receptors (e.g., ADRB2) aligns with the involvement of CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) in metabolizing these types of molecules, suggesting possible metabolic interactions.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis and the biological context, the related genes are: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, ADRB2, and CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. These genes are involved in neurotransmitter signaling and drug metabolism, which could be influenced by the molecule's structure. 
Summary of related genes: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, ADRB2, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
