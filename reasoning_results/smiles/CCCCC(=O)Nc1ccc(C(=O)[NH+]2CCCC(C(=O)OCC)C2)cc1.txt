Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCC(=O)Nc1ccc(C(=O)[NH+]2CCCC(C(=O)OCC)C2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple functional groups such as an amide (C=O), a nitro group (-NO2), and several carbon chains. These features suggest that the molecule could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction, metabolism, or ion channel regulation.
Step 2: Notably, the molecule includes a benzene ring system, which is often found in ligands for receptors and transporters. This structural feature could potentially bind to or modulate the activity of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other membrane proteins.
Step 3: Among the listed genes, those encoding GPCRs are particularly relevant due to their role in neurotransmission and hormone signaling. The molecule's ability to interact with membrane proteins makes it plausible that it could affect the function of GPCRs like DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), HTR2A (Serotonin receptor 2A), and HTR2B (Serotonin receptor 2B).
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of an amide group suggests potential interactions with enzymes or transporters that have catalytic or binding sites for similar functional groups. Genes such as CYP2D6 (Cytochrome P450 2D6), which plays a role in drug metabolism, could be influenced by this molecule.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the molecule may be related to the following genes: DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, CYP2D6.
Related Gene Names:
- DRD2
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- CYP2D6 Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple functional groups such as an amide (C=O), a nitro group (-NO2), and several carbon chains. These features suggest that the molecule could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction, metabolism, or ion channel regulation.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring system indicates potential binding to or modulation of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are known to play crucial roles in neurotransmission and hormone signaling.
Step 3: Considering the functional groups and the structural complexity, the molecule might interact with enzymes or transporters that have catalytic or binding sites for similar functional groups. For example, cytochrome P450 enzymes (like CYP2D6) could be affected by this molecule due to its amide group.
Step 4: Given the potential interactions with GPCRs and enzymes, the following genes are likely to be related: DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), HTR2A (Serotonin receptor 2A), HTR2B (Serotonin receptor 2B), and CYP2D6 (Cytochrome P450 2D6).
Step 5: Summary of Related Gene Names:
