Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(-n2c(=S)[n-]c3cc(C(=O)NCCC[NH+]4CCCC4=O)ccc3c2=O)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with several functional groups including a thioether (-S), an amide (N-C=O), a carboxylic acid (O=C-OH), and aromatic rings. These structural features suggest that the molecule could potentially interact with proteins involved in various biological processes such as signal transduction, enzyme activity modulation, and receptor binding.
Step 2: Analyzing the genes listed, we can identify potential relationships based on their known functions and targets. For instance, CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) are known to metabolize xenobiotics and drugs, which might be influenced by the presence of the thioether and amide groups in the molecule. Additionally, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like DRD2 (Dopamine D2 receptor), HTR1A (Serotonin 1A receptor), and HRH1 (Histamine H1 receptor) could be targeted due to the presence of amine functionalities.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a carboxylic acid group, which could interact with ion channels or other proteins that bind acidic compounds. This feature might relate to genes encoding for ion channels or transporters, such as KCNH2 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2) or SLC6A2 (solute carrier family 6 member 2).
Step 4: Furthermore, the presence of aromatic rings suggests potential interactions with DNA-binding proteins or transcription factors, which could link to genes involved in regulation and signaling pathways, such as ESR1 (Estrogen receptor alpha) or PTGS1 (Cyclooxygenase 1).
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis and the known functions of the listed genes, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes including CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR1A, HRH1, KCNH2, ESR1, and PTGS1. These genes are involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmission, hormone signaling, and inflammatory responses, making them plausible targets for the described molecule.
