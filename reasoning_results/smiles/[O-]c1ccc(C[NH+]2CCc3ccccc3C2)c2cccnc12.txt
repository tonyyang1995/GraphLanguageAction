Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [O-]c1ccc(C[NH+]2CCc3ccccc3C2)c2cccnc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains an amine group (-NH2) which is a common functional group for many bioactive molecules. This suggests that the molecule may interact with proteins containing amine binding sites, such as receptors.
Step 2: The molecule also has a quinolone-like structure (quinoline ring system) which is known to be involved in drug metabolism and signaling pathways. This indicates potential interactions with enzymes and transporters that metabolize or transport similar compounds.
Step 3: Notably, the presence of a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (+) in the molecule could indicate it as a partial agonist or antagonist of certain receptors, such as adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors. This suggests possible interactions with genes encoding these receptors.
Step 4: Given the quinoline ring and amine functionalities, the molecule might have affinity for cytochrome P450 enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 5: The molecule's structure also hints at potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to its aromatic and amine functionalities, which could relate to genes like HTR2A, HTR2B, and DRD2.
