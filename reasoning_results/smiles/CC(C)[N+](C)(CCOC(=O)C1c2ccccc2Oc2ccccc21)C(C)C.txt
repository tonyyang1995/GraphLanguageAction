Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)[N+](C)(CCOC(=O)C1c2ccccc2Oc2ccccc21)C(C)C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple functional groups such as a benzene ring, an amine group, a carboxylic acid group, and ester bonds. These functional groups are indicative of molecules that can interact with receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring with attached functional groups suggests potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are often involved in signal transduction pathways and are encoded by genes such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4. Additionally, the presence of a carboxylic acid group and ester bonds might indicate the molecule could be an inhibitor or activator of enzymes like CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a cyclic structure (c2ccccc2Oc2ccccc21), which may suggest it could bind to ion channels or other proteins involved in calcium signaling, potentially related to CACNA1H. Furthermore, the presence of an alcohol group (CCOC(=O)C1) could indicate a potential interaction with proteins involved in calcium signaling or neurotransmission, such as HRH1.
Step 4: Given the complexity and the presence of both receptor-like and enzyme-like structures, the molecule may have multiple targets across various genes. However, the primary focus seems to be on receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission, hormone signaling, and drug metabolism.
Step 5: Based on the detailed analysis, the molecule appears to be most closely related to the following genes: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, CACNA1H, and HRH1. These genes are involved in neurotransmission, hormone signaling, and drug metabolism, which aligns with the functional groups present in the molecule.
