Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCS(=O)(=O)Nc1ccc(C2=N[NH+](C(=O)c3ccco3)C(c3ccc(C)cc3)C2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that is an inhibitor of CYP enzymes, specifically CYP2D6 and CYP2C19. This is indicated by the presence of a quinolone-like structure, which is known to be a common pharmacophore for CYP enzyme inhibitors.
Step 2: The molecule also contains a nitrile group (-CN), which is characteristic of drugs that inhibit the enzyme ABL1, a tyrosine kinase involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth and survival.
Step 3: The overall structure of the molecule suggests it may interact with receptors and ion channels. The presence of a benzene ring and a carboxylic acid group could indicate potential interactions with adrenergic (ADRA1D, ADRA2B) and adrenergic (ADRB2) receptors, as well as voltage-gated calcium channels (CACNA1H).
Step 4: The molecule's structure also hints at its ability to modulate G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). The presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocycle and a phenyl ring could suggest interaction with serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 5: Given the above structural features, the molecule is likely to have a significant relationship with the following genes: CYP2D6, CYP2C19, ABL1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CACNA1H, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
