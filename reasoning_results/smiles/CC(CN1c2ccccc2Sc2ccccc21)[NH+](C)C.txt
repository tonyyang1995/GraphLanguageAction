Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(CN1c2ccccc2Sc2ccccc21)[NH+](C)C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure including a benzene ring (represented by CN1c2ccccc2S), a nitro group (-NO2), and an amine group (-NH2). These functional groups suggest potential interactions with enzymes or receptors involved in signal transduction and metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a nitro group could indicate a molecule that might act as a ligand for receptors such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) or dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), which often have nitrogen-containing binding sites. The amine group (-NH2) further supports this hypothesis as it can form hydrogen bonds with receptor proteins.
Step 3: The benzene ring and the sulfur atom (S) attached to it could also suggest interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics through oxidation reactions involving aromatic rings and sulfuration.
Step 4: The overall structure does not directly suggest strong interactions with kinases (such as LCK, HRH1, KDR, MCL1), G-protein coupled receptors (like CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, SIGMAR1, PTGS1), or other genes listed, but could potentially influence their activity indirectly through metabolic pathways.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule is most likely related to genes involved in neurotransmitter signaling (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, SIGMAR1) and drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
