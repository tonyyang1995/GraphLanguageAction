Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule with a central sulfur atom (S) double-bonded to an oxygen atom (O), indicating it is likely a sulfonamide compound. This structure is common in drugs that interact with receptors and transport proteins.
Step 2: The molecule also contains a nitrile group (-C#N), which suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism such as CYP enzymes.
Step 3: The presence of multiple aromatic rings, particularly the benzene rings, indicates the molecule could interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), as these often have extended hydrophobic regions for ligand binding.
Step 4: Given the structure's features, it might interact with genes involved in neurotransmitter systems and signal transduction pathways, such as those encoding GPCRs like DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HRH1.
Step 5: Additionally, due to its potential to affect drug metabolism, it may also interact with genes coding for enzymes involved in phase I and II metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4.
