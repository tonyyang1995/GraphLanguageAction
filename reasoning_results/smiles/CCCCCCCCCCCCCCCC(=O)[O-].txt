Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)[O-] corresponds to a linear chain of 14 carbon atoms with a carboxylate group (-COO-) attached at one end. This structure indicates that the molecule is an organic compound, specifically a fatty acid derivative with a carboxylate functionality.
Step 2: The carboxylate group (-COO-) is common in molecules that interact with ion channels and receptors, which are proteins involved in signal transduction pathways. These interactions often modulate the activity of these proteins, affecting cellular processes such as neurotransmission and ion transport.
Step 3: Considering the presence of the carboxylate group, this molecule could potentially interact with ion channels and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), given their ability to bind negatively charged ligands. Specifically, it might interact with members of the adrenergic receptor family (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 4: Additionally, the carboxylate group might influence the binding affinity of the molecule to other receptors, such as serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), which are known to have diverse binding sites for various ligands including acidic molecules.
Step 5: Based on the structure and potential interactions, the related genes are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
Summary of related genes:
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- ADRB2
- CHRM1
- CHRM3
- CHRM4
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- HTR6
These genes encode receptors that could be targeted by the described molecule due to its carboxylate group and linear structure.
