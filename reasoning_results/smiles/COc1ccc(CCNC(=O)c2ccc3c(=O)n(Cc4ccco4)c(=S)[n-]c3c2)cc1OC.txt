Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(CCNC(=O)c2ccc3c(=O)n(Cc4ccco4)c(=S)[n-]c3c2)cc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains several functional groups including a benzene ring, an amide group (-CONH-), a thioether (-S-), and an ester group (-COO-). These structural elements suggest that the molecule could interact with proteins involved in various biological processes such as signal transduction, enzyme activity, and receptor binding.
Step 2: Notably, the presence of an amide and a thioether group indicates that this molecule might have affinity for enzymes or receptors that contain amino acid residues or cysteine residues. This could be relevant to genes encoding enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism via oxidation reactions, or receptors such as DRD2 (Dopamine Receptor D2), HTR2A (Serotonin Receptor 5-HT2A), and HTR2B (Serotonin Receptor 5-HT2B).
Step 3: The benzene ring and the ester group may also indicate potential interactions with proteins that include aromatic residues or that are involved in ligand binding, which could be pertinent to genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and HRH1.
Step 4: Furthermore, the presence of a thioether group could imply a possible interaction with proteins containing cysteine residues, which might be relevant to genes such as PTGS1 (Cyclooxygenase 1) and SIGMAR1 (Sigma Receptor 1).
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes are: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, PTGS1, and SIGMAR1. These genes are involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmission, and signal transduction pathways. 
Summary of Related Genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, PTGS1, SIGMAR1.
