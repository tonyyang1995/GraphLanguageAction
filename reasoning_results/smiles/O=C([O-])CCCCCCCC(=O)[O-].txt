Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])CCCCCCCC(=O)[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a structure that includes an oxygen double-bonded to a carbon atom (O=C), which is part of a benzene ring system. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4.
Step 2: Additionally, the molecule contains a carboxylate group (-COO-) and a negatively charged oxygen atom ([O-]), indicating it may be a polar compound. Such compounds often interact with ion channels and receptors, including those encoded by CACNA1H and HRH1.
Step 3: The presence of multiple aromatic rings and hydrophobic groups suggests the molecule could interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 are all involved in the regulation of GPCRs and could potentially interact with this molecule.
Step 4: The molecule also includes a benzene ring, which is a common feature in many ligands for nuclear receptors. Genes like NR1H2 (which encodes liver X receptor alpha) and SIGMAR1 might be involved in interactions with this molecule due to their role in signal transduction pathways.
Step 5: Given the above structural features, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes involved in drug metabolism, ion channel regulation, GPCR signaling, and nuclear receptor function. These include: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, CACNA1H, HRH1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, NR1H2, and SIGMAR1.
