Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCCCc1nc2ccccc2c(=O)n1NC(=O)c1c([O-])c2c(n(CC(C)C)c1=O)CCCC2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule, which includes multiple functional groups such as amides, esters, and a carboxylate group. This molecule has a benzene ring structure with several substituents, indicating it could potentially interact with receptors or enzymes involved in signaling pathways.
Step 2: Upon closer inspection, the presence of amide and carboxylate functionalities suggests that this molecule might be an inhibitor or activator of enzymes involved in drug metabolism or neurotransmission. For instance, molecules with similar functional groups often target cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP family), which are key in metabolizing many drugs and endogenous substances.
Step 3: The molecule's structure also indicates potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). The presence of a carboxylate group and amides, along with the overall size and shape of the molecule, suggest it could bind to receptors such as adrenergic (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and dopaminergic (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) receptors, which are known for their roles in neurotransmission and signal transduction.
Step 4: Given the presence of ester and amide linkages, the molecule might also interact with enzymes like CYP2D6, which plays a crucial role in the metabolism of various drugs and xenobiotics. Additionally, the presence of a carboxylate group suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism or transport, such as CYP1A2 and PTGS1.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the most likely related genes to this molecule are those involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmission, specifically: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, and PTGS1.
Summary of related genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, PTGS1.
