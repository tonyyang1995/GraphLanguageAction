Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+]1CCCC1c1cccnc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure, featuring an amide group (NH+) attached to a benzene ring, which is part of a larger aromatic system. This pattern suggests that the molecule could interact with proteins involved in signaling pathways, as many such proteins have binding sites for ligands with similar aromatic and amide features.
Step 2: The presence of multiple benzene rings and nitrogen atoms implies the molecule might be capable of forming hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions, which are important for binding to receptor proteins like G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels. These types of interactions are crucial for the function of genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, all of which encode for GPCRs and their associated signaling pathways.
Step 3: Given the presence of a benzene ring system, the molecule may also interact with enzymes such as those encoded by CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize drugs and xenobiotics through oxidation reactions. These genes play a role in drug metabolism and response, indicating potential interactions with the described molecular structure.
Step 4: The molecule’s structure, with its aromatic and amide groups, might also be relevant to genes encoding ion channels and transporters, such as KCNH2, LCK, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4. These genes are involved in the regulation of ion fluxes and neurotransmitter transport, which are essential for neuronal function and communication.
Step 5: Based on the molecule’s structural characteristics, it is likely to have significant interactions with the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, KCNH2, LCK, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4. These genes are primarily involved in neurotransmission, hormone signaling, and drug metabolism.
