Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1c([O-])c(=O)ccn1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has the SMILES string "Cc1c([O-])c(=O)ccn1C", which represents an organic compound containing a benzene ring, a carboxyl group (-COOH), and an amide group (-CONH). The presence of a carboxyl group suggests that this molecule could be an acid or a derivative of an acid.
Step 2: Analyzing the structure further, the molecule contains a negatively charged oxygen atom (O-) attached to the benzene ring, indicating it might be a salt form of an acid. The amide group (-CONH) suggests potential interactions with proteins or enzymes that have amine groups, such as receptors or transporters.
Step 3: Considering the functional groups present in the molecule, it is likely to interact with proteins involved in signaling pathways, neurotransmitter transport, or metabolic processes. This is because carboxylic acids and their derivatives often act as ligands for various receptors and enzymes.
Step 4: Among the provided genes, several are known to be involved in signal transduction, neurotransmitter regulation, and drug metabolism. For instance, genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (such as CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HRH1) and transporters (like SLC6A2, SLC6A4) are relevant due to the presence of functional groups that can interact with these types of proteins.
Step 5: Additionally, genes involved in drug metabolism, such as those coding for cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), are also potentially related because the molecule's acidic nature might influence its metabolism in the body.
Summary of related gene names:
- CHRM1
- CHRM3
- CHRM4
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- HRH1
- SLC6A2
- SLC6A4
- CYP1A2
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
These genes are likely to have some form of interaction with the described molecule based on its chemical structure and the roles of the encoded proteins. However, without experimental evidence, it cannot be conclusively stated that the molecule directly interacts with all of these genes. Further research would be needed to confirm these interactions.
