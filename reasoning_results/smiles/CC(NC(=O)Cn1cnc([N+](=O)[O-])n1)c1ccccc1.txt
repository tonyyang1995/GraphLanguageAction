Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(NC(=O)Cn1cnc([N+](=O)[O-])n1)c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule, which appears to be a derivative of the indole ring system. This structural feature suggests that the molecule could interact with proteins that have binding sites for similar chemical structures.
Step 2: Indole derivatives are known to interact with various receptors and enzymes, including those encoded by genes such as CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4. These cytochrome P450 enzymes are involved in the metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics, and their interactions with the molecule might influence its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a quinoline-like structure (as indicated by the "N" and "=O" elements) could potentially lead to interactions with adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors, such as ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, and DRD4. These receptors are involved in neurotransmission and are targets for various psychiatric and neurological disorders.
Step 4: Furthermore, the molecule's structure may also engage in interactions with estrogen receptors like ESR1, which are implicated in hormone-dependent cancers and other conditions.
Step 5: Given the above considerations, the related genes to this molecule include: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD4, and ESR1.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2D6
- CYP2C9
- CYP3A4
- ADRA2B
- ADRB2
- DRD2
- DRD4
- ESR1 Step 5: Summary of related gene names:
- ESR1
These genes encode proteins that are likely to interact with the described molecule due to its structural features.
