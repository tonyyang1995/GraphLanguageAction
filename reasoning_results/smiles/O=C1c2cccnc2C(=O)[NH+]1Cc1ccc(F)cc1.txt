Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C1c2cccnc2C(=O)[NH+]1Cc1ccc(F)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple functional groups such as an amide (N-C=O), a nitrile (-CN), and a phenyl ring system. These features suggest the molecule could interact with proteins involved in signaling pathways, transport, and metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrile group and a phenyl ring system indicates potential for interaction with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes. This is relevant to CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize various drugs including those that might contain similar functional groups.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a quaternary ammonium group, which is positively charged. This could be important for interactions with receptors that have binding sites for positively charged molecules, such as adrenergic and cholinergic receptors. This suggests possible interactions with ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 4: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (COOH) could indicate the molecule has acidic properties and may act as a ligand for certain ion channels or receptors, such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are G-protein coupled receptors involved in neurotransmission.
Step 5: Given the molecule's structure and potential interactions with metabolic enzymes and receptor proteins, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C. 
Summary of related genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C.
