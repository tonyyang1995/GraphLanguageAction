Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc2ccc(=O)oc2c([O-])c1[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a structure that includes a benzene ring, an oxetane ring, and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The benzene ring is part of a tricyclic structure, which is characteristic of many drugs targeting receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmission or metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylic acid group suggests the molecule could be an inhibitor or substrate for enzymes like CYP2D6, which metabolizes carboxylic acids and other drugs, or for ion channels like KCNH2 (hERG), which are often targeted by drugs affecting cardiac function.
Step 3: The oxetane ring, along with the overall structure, indicates potential interactions with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are known to bind small molecules and have various roles in neurotransmission.
Step 4: Given the structural complexity and the presence of functional groups that could interact with enzymes and receptors, the molecule is likely to be related to multiple genes involved in drug metabolism and receptor signaling, including CYP2D6, KCNH2, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
Step 5: Based on the detailed analysis of the molecule's structure and its potential interactions, the related genes include CYP2D6, KCNH2, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2D6
- KCNH2
- DRD2
- DRD3
- DRD4 Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring, which is common in many drugs that interact with proteins or receptors.
Step 2: It also has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), suggesting it might be a substrate or inhibitor for enzymes like CYP2D6, which metabolizes carboxylic acids.
Step 3: The oxetane ring and overall structure indicate potential interactions with GPCRs, particularly those involved in neurotransmission.
Step 4: Given the structure, the molecule could interact with dopamine receptors, such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
Step 5: Therefore, the related genes include CYP2D6, KCNH2, and DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
- DRD4 Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring, which is common in many pharmaceuticals and can interact with various proteins.
Step 2: It has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), indicating potential interaction with enzymes like CYP2D6, which metabolize carboxylic acids.
Step 3: The oxetane ring and overall structure suggest possible binding to GPCRs, particularly dopamine receptors.
Step 4: The structure implies interactions with receptors like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are involved in neurotransmission.
