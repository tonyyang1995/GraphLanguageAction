Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1nc(N2CC[NH+](C(=O)c3cccs3)CC2)c2c3c(sc2n1)CCCC3, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a quinoline ring system, which is characteristic of several drugs that interact with receptors and enzymes. This structural feature suggests potential interactions with genes encoding receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of amide and ester functionalities indicates the molecule could act as an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
Step 3: The molecule's overall size and hydrophobicity suggest it may bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as DRD2, HTR2A, and HTR2B, which are known to have similar binding profiles.
Step 4: The nitrogen-containing heterocycles and amine groups in the molecule indicate possible interaction with ion channels or neurotransmitter systems, potentially involving genes like KCNH2 and SLC6A4.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure, it is most likely to be related to the following genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, KCNH2, SLC6A4. Step 5: Summary of Related Genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, KCNH2, SLC6A4.
