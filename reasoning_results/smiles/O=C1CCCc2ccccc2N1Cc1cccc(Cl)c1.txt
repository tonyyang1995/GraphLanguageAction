Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples or additional text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a cyano group (-CN) attached, which is characteristic of many drugs that interact with nuclear receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and pain modulation.
Step 2: The presence of a pyridine ring and a quinoline ring suggests potential interactions with enzymes such as CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a tricyclic structure, which is often associated with compounds that modulate G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as DRD2, HTR1A, and HTR2A.
Step 4: The aromatic amine group could potentially interact with proteins involved in ion channels, like KCNH2, which is a potassium channel subunit.
Step 5: The overall structure hints at possible interactions with genes involved in neurotransmitter systems and pain pathways, including DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C.
