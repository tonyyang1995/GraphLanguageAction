Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc2c(C)cc(N3CCOCC3)nc2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule, represented by the SMILES string COc1ccc2c(C)cc(N3CCOCC3)nc2c1, contains several functional groups including a phenyl ring (c1ccc2), a nitrile group (N3CCO), and an amide group (CO). These structural features suggest potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for aromatic rings, nitriles, or amides.
Step 2: The presence of a phenyl ring in the molecule suggests it could interact with proteins containing aromatic binding pockets, such as certain G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are known to be involved in signal transduction pathways and are often targeted by drugs due to their role in various physiological processes.
Step 3: Among the listed genes, several are associated with GPCRs. For instance, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 all encode for different subtypes of GPCRs. The molecule’s aromatic ring might facilitate its binding to these receptors, potentially modulating their activity.
Step 4: Additionally, the nitrile group (-CN) in the molecule could also interact with enzymes that recognize or utilize such functional groups, like certain cytochrome P450 enzymes (e.g., CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). These enzymes play crucial roles in drug metabolism, and the molecule’s nitrile group might influence their activity, affecting the pharmacokinetics of the molecule.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the molecule appears to be most likely related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. These genes are primarily involved in receptor signaling and drug metabolism, respectively. 
Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4.
