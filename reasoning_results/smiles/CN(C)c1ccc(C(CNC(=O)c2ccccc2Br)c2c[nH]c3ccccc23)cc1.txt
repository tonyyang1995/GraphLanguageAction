Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CN(C)c1ccc(C(CNC(=O)c2ccccc2Br)c2c[nH]c3ccccc23)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples or extra instructions.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with multiple substituents including a pyridine ring, a bromo-phenyl group, and a cyano group. This complex aromatic structure suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in signal transduction and receptor binding.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) is characteristic of molecules that can act as ligands for receptors such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This feature indicates a possible interaction with genes encoding GPCRs.
Step 3: The bromo-phenyl group (-BrPh) can serve as an electrophilic moiety, which may interact with nucleophilic sites on proteins, including those involved in signal transduction pathways. This suggests potential interactions with genes encoding enzymes or signaling proteins.
Step 4: The molecule’s overall structure, particularly the presence of aromatic rings and functional groups like -CN and -BrPh, may facilitate binding to membrane-bound receptors or ion channels, which are often encoded by genes listed here.
Step 5: Based on the structural features identified, the molecule could be related to genes encoding GPCRs (such as CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HRH1), ion channels (like KCNH2), and enzymes (such as CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
