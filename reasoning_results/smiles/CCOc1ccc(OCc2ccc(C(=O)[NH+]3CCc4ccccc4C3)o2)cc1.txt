Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOc1ccc(OCc2ccc(C(=O)[NH+]3CCc4ccccc4C3)o2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is a common structural feature in many ligands that interact with receptors such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This suggests potential interactions with genes encoding GPCRs.
Step 2: The molecule also includes an amide group (-CONH) and an ester group (-COOR), which are functional groups often involved in binding to enzymes and receptors. This indicates possible interactions with genes encoding enzymes or receptors that recognize these functional groups.
Step 3: The presence of a quinolone-like structure and a pyrrolidine ring might suggest interactions with genes encoding enzymes like CYP2D6, which metabolizes drugs containing these structures.
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule, including its hydrophobic and polar regions, could potentially allow it to bind to and modulate the activity of GPCRs, particularly those that have a high affinity for molecules with similar properties.
Step 5: Based on the molecular features and potential interactions, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2D6, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, and CYP3A4.
Summary of Related Genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2D6, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP3A4.
