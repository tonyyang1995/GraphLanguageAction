Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(CNS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(Br)s1)[NH+]1CCC2(CC1)OCCO2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a cyano group (-CN), an amide group (-CONH2), and a bromine atom (Br). These functional groups are characteristic of compounds that may interact with certain receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group and amide can suggest potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which often have hydrophobic binding pockets for small molecules containing these functional groups. This is relevant to genes encoding GPCRs such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and HRH1.
Step 3: The bromine atom is a halogen that can participate in various types of chemical reactions, including those that could modulate enzyme activity. This suggests possible interactions with enzymes encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 4: The molecule also has a quinoline-like structure, which can be recognized by certain receptor sites. This could imply a relationship with HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which encode serotonin receptors.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C. These genes encode receptors and enzymes that might interact with the described molecular structure.
