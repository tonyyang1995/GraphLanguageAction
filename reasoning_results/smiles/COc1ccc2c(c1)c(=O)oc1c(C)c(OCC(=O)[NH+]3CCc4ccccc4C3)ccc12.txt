Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc2c(c1)c(=O)oc1c(C)c(OCC(=O)[NH+]3CCc4ccccc4C3)ccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system and a pyrrole ring fused to it, forming a quinolone-like structure. This pattern is often found in molecules that interact with receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) and an amide group (-CONH2) suggests that the molecule may be capable of interacting with proteins such as ion channels, receptors, and kinases through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions.
Step 3: The molecule also has a pyridine ring attached to the quinolone core via an amide bond, which could potentially form hydrogen bonds with proteins containing polar amino acid residues.
Step 4: Given the structural features, the molecule might have affinity for receptors and enzymes such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), ion channels, and kinases, which are associated with several of the listed genes including DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, KCNH2, LCK, PTGS1, and SLC6A2.
Step 5: Summary of related genes: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, KCNH2, LCK, PTGS1, SLC6A2. These genes encode proteins that are involved in various physiological processes, including neurotransmission and inflammatory responses. The molecule's structure suggests potential interactions with these proteins, which could influence their functions.
