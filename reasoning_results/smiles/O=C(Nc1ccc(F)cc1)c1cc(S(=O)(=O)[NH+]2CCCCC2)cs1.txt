Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Nc1ccc(F)cc1)c1cc(S(=O)(=O)[NH+]2CCCCC2)cs1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a cyano group (-CN) and a nitro group (-NO2), which are known to interact with certain enzymes involved in drug metabolism. These functional groups may be relevant to the CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Step 2: The molecule also includes a sulfonamide moiety (-SO2NH2), which can form hydrogen bonds and may interact with receptors such as HTR2A and HTR2B (serotonin receptors). 
Step 3: The presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) suggests potential interactions with enzymes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which metabolize compounds with similar functional groups.
Step 4: The molecule has a quinoline-like structure, which might interact with ATP-binding cassette transporters such as ABCB1, which is involved in efflux of drugs from cells.
Step 5: Given the above structural features, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ABCB1, HTR2A, HTR2B, CYP2C9.
Summary of related genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ABCB1, HTR2A, HTR2B, CYP2C9.
