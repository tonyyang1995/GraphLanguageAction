Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(NCC[NH+]1CCOCC1)c1ccc(Cl)cc1[N+](=O)[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other type of explanation.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring, which is part of the N-substituted imidazolidinone moiety. This structure is often found in ligands for various receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a quaternary ammonium group (N+), an amide (C=N), and a carboxylate (COO-) suggests the molecule could interact with ion channels, receptors, or transporters.
Step 3: The molecule includes a benzene ring substituted with chlorine atoms, which might indicate a pharmacophore for certain receptor interactions or enzyme inhibition.
Step 4: Considering the structure, the molecule is likely to interact with receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure, the related genes are likely to be involved in neurotransmission and signaling, including DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Summary of related genes: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
