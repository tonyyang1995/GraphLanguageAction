Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N#CCSc1nc2scc(-c3cccs3)c2c(=O)n1CCc1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex molecule that includes multiple rings and functional groups such as amide (-CO-N), alkene (C=C), and aromatic (N#C) functionalities. This structure suggests the molecule may interact with proteins that have binding sites for similar chemical moieties.
Step 2: Analyzing the chemical structure further, we observe that the molecule contains an amide group (-CO-N), which is a common feature in ligands that can bind to receptors such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other protein targets. The presence of aromatic rings and possibly a cationic nitrogen (N#C) could indicate interactions with ion channels or other charged protein surfaces.
Step 3: Considering the presence of an amide and the overall complexity of the molecule, it is likely to interact with enzymes that metabolize drugs or chemicals, such as those encoded by CYP (cytochrome P450) genes, particularly CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These enzymes are involved in the metabolism of various pharmaceuticals and xenobiotics, and their activity can be influenced by structural analogs like the one described.
Step 4: Given the potential for interaction with CYP enzymes, there is also a possibility that the molecule could affect neurotransmitter receptors, such as those encoded by HTR (serotonin receptor) genes (e.g., HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C). Serotonin receptors are known to be modulated by various ligands, and the presence of an amide and aromatic rings might provide a suitable binding pocket for this molecule.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule appears to be related to several genes involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6) and neurotransmission (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C).
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule appears to be related to several genes involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6) and neurotransmission (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C). 
- HTR2C
These genes play crucial roles in the metabolism of the molecule and its effects on neurotransmission, making them key targets for understanding the molecule's biological activity.
