Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+]=C(NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(Cl)cc1)N1CC(c2ccccc2)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)=N1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a nitrogen atom that is part of an amide group (NH+) and is double-bonded to a carbon atom, which is further double-bonded to another carbon atom. This structure suggests the presence of a substituted amide moiety. Such functional groups are often involved in interactions with receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a thiophene ring system (NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(Cl)cc1), which is known to interact with various protein targets, including receptors and transporters. Thiophenes can be recognized by proteins due to their aromatic nature and ability to form hydrogen bonds.
Step 3: Given the presence of the thiophene ring and the amide moiety, this molecule might interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are known to have binding sites for molecules containing aromatic rings and amides. Examples of such genes include DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), DRD3 (Dopamine receptor D3), DRD4 (Dopamine receptor D4), HTR1A (Serotonin receptor 1A), HTR2A (Serotonin receptor 2A), HTR2B (Serotonin receptor 2B), HTR2C (Serotonin receptor 2C), and HTR6 (Serotonin receptor 5-HT6).
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure could potentially interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP enzymes) due to its complexity and the presence of substituents like chlorine atoms. CYP enzymes are responsible for metabolizing drugs and other xenobiotics, and their activity can be influenced by structural features of the substrate. Genes related to CYP enzymes include CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
Step 5: The molecule's overall structure, with its amide and thiophene components, may also interact with ion channels and transporters. For example, SLC6A2 (Noradrenaline transporter) and SLC6A4 (Serotonin transporter) are known to bind small molecules with similar functional groups. Furthermore, the molecule might interact with HRH1 (Histamine H1 receptor), which has been shown to bind molecules containing aromatic rings and amides.
Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2, DRD3, DRD4
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6
- SLC6A2, SLC6A4
- HRH1
These genes are likely to be influenced by the molecule due to the presence of functional groups that can interact with them. However, the exact mechanism and extent of interaction would require further experimental validation.
