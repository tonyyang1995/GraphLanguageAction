Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)c1sc(-c2ccc(OC)cc2)cc1NC(C)=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule, likely a drug-like compound. It contains several functional groups including an amide (C=O), a carboxylic acid (COOH), and a benzene ring system, which are common in pharmaceuticals targeting various receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The molecular structure includes a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) and a benzene ring, suggesting potential for interaction with receptors that have hydrophobic binding pockets and may be involved in signal transduction pathways. This could be relevant to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels, which are often targeted by drugs.
Step 3: The presence of an amide and carboxylic acid group suggests the molecule might act as an inhibitor or activator of enzymes, such as those involved in metabolism. CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 are enzymes known to metabolize many drugs, making them relevant targets.
Step 4: Given the presence of a benzene ring and other aromatic structures, this molecule could interact with nuclear receptors like PPARγ (PPARG), which regulate gene expression in response to ligands.
Step 5: The overall structure does not directly suggest interactions with kinases, growth factors, or tyrosine kinases, so the related genes such as LCK, FLT1, and HRH1 are less likely to be directly affected by this molecule.
Summary of Related Gene Names:
- CYP1A2
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- PPARγ (PPARG)
- OPRK1
- SLC6A2
- SLC6A4
These genes are more likely to be involved in the pharmacological effects of the molecule due to its structural features.
