Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(=O)c1ccc2c(c1)N(CCC[NH+]1CCC(CCO)CC1)c1ccccc1S2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring fused to a benzene ring, which is characteristic of many drugs that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature suggests potential interaction with genes encoding GPCRs.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) and a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) indicates the molecule could act as an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors, which may be relevant to genes involved in signaling pathways.
Step 3: The aromatic amine group and the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups suggest the molecule might have antioxidant properties or interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, potentially related to CYP genes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4.
Step 4: The overall structure includes a quinoline-like moiety, which could indicate interactions with receptors like adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B), dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 5: Given the diverse functional groups and structural complexity, the molecule could also interact with genes involved in inflammatory responses, such as PTGS1, and neurotransmitter systems, including HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
