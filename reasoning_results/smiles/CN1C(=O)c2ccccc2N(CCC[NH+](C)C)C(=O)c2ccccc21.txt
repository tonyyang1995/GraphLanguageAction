Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CN1C(=O)c2ccccc2N(CCC[NH+](C)C)C(=O)c2ccccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule is a complex organic compound with multiple functional groups including an amide (C(=O)N), a cyclic amine (N(CCC[NH+](C)C)), and aromatic rings (c2cccc2). The presence of these features suggests that the molecule could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction or metabolism.
Step 2: The cyclic amine group N(CCC[NH+](C)C) indicates the presence of a positively charged nitrogen, which can form hydrogen bonds or cation-π interactions. Such interactions are common in the binding sites of receptors like G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels, which are often targeted by drugs.
Step 3: The amide group C(=O)N is a common site for acetylation and can participate in hydrogen bonding. This functionality is often found in molecules that interact with enzymes such as kinases or transporters, which are encoded by genes like CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and SLC6A4.
Step 4: The aromatic rings suggest the molecule might have potential for interacting with membrane-bound receptors or ion channels, as these structures often have hydrophobic regions that can bind to lipophilic ligands. This is relevant to genes encoding receptors like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 5: Given the complexity and the presence of functional groups that can interact with various types of proteins, the molecule could be related to several genes involved in signaling pathways and drug metabolism. Specifically, it may interact with genes encoding GPCRs, ion channels, and metabolic enzymes.
Summary of related gene names:
- GPCRs: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4
- Ion channels: KCNH2, HRH1
- Metabolic enzymes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, SLC6A4
Note: Not all listed genes are directly related based on the provided information, but they are included as examples of genes that could potentially interact with a molecule with similar structural features. The actual interaction would depend on further experimental validation.
