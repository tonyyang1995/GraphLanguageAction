Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(=NC(=O)c2sc3ccccc3c2Cl)[n-]c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex molecule with multiple functional groups including a nitrile (-CN), an amide (-CONH-), and halogen substituents (Cl). This structure suggests that the molecule could interact with proteins involved in transport, metabolism, or signaling pathways.
Step 2: Considering the presence of a nitrile group and an amide, this molecule likely has the potential to act as a substrate for enzymes involved in metabolic processes such as those encoded by CYP2C19 and CYP2D6. These enzymes are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics, indicating a possible interaction between the molecule and these genes.
Step 3: The halogen substituent (Cl) might influence the molecule’s ability to interact with membrane proteins or receptors. This could suggest a connection to genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are known to be sensitive to halogenated compounds.
Step 4: Given the complexity of the molecule, it may also affect ion channels or voltage-gated calcium channels, as indicated by the presence of a conjugated double bond system. Genes like KCNH2 and CACNA1H, which encode potassium and calcium channels respectively, could be relevant targets.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule could potentially interact with several genes including: CYP2C19, CYP2D6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, KCNH2, and CACNA1H.
