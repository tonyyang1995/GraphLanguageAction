Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)CC(N=c1nc(N2CCOCC2)[n-]c(N2CCOCC2)n1)c1ccccc1Cl, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound, specifically a benzodiazepine derivative. It contains several functional groups such as amide (N=C=O), carboxylic acid (COOH), and ester (O=C-O). These functional groups are often found in molecules that interact with receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-CONH-) suggests potential interactions with proteins containing amino acid residues that can form hydrogen bonds, such as those found in G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This is relevant to genes encoding GPCRs, including adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 3: The carboxylic acid and ester functionalities might indicate the molecule could be an inhibitor or substrate for enzymes involved in metabolism or signaling pathways. CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) are known to metabolize many drugs and xenobiotics, and thus, this molecule could potentially interact with them.
Step 4: The molecule's overall structure and functional groups suggest it could also interact with ion channels, particularly those involved in calcium and potassium ions, which are crucial for neuronal excitability. KCNH2 (a voltage-gated potassium channel subunit) could be a target.
Step 5: Given the interaction potential with GPCRs and ion channels, and considering the involvement of these pathways in neurotransmission, the following genes are likely to be related: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2.
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2.
