Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC1=[NH+]S(=O)(=O)c2cc(Cl)ccc2N1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple functional groups such as an amide (N-H), a carbonyl (C=O), a sulfonyl (S=O), a phenyl ring, and halogen (Cl). These structural features suggest potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for similar functional groups or motifs.
Step 2: Among the provided genes, several are involved in encoding receptors or enzymes that could interact with molecules possessing these functional groups. For instance, CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) are known to metabolize various xenobiotics, including drugs, which often contain aromatic rings and functional groups like those present in the molecule.
Step 3: Additionally, some genes encode neurotransmitter receptors or transporters that might interact with the molecule due to its chemical nature. Genes like HTR2A, HTR2B, and SLC6A4 are examples where the molecule's amine group and overall structure could potentially fit into the binding sites of these receptors or transporters.
Step 4: Furthermore, the presence of a sulfonyl group in the molecule may indicate a possible interaction with kinases or other protein targets, such as LCK (Lck), which is a tyrosine kinase involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis and potential interactions, the genes related to this molecule include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, LCK, SLC6A4.
