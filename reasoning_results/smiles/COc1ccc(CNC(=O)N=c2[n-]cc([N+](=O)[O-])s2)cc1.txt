Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(CNC(=O)N=c2[n-]cc([N+](=O)[O-])s2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound that includes a benzene ring system, a pyrrolidine ring, and a number of functional groups such as an amide (N-C=O), a nitrile (-CN), and a sulfonamide group (N-SO2-N). These structural features suggest the molecule could have various biological activities, including interactions with receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: Analyzing the pattern of the molecule, it contains a quaternary nitrogen atom in the sulfonamide group which is known to be involved in binding to proteins, particularly those containing positively charged amino acid residues. This could potentially interact with ion channels, receptors, or transporters.
Step 3: Considering the presence of the amide group, the molecule may also be capable of forming hydrogen bonds, which are crucial for the binding to many enzymes and receptors, especially those that have amino acid side chains with polar functional groups.
Step 4: Given the complexity and specific functional groups of the molecule, it could be related to several genes encoding proteins that are involved in neurotransmission, signal transduction, and drug metabolism. For instance, it might interact with receptors like HTR2A (serotonin receptor), HTR2B (serotonin receptor), or DRD2 (dopamine receptor).
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential to interact with neurotransmitter receptors and enzymes, the related genes include: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
