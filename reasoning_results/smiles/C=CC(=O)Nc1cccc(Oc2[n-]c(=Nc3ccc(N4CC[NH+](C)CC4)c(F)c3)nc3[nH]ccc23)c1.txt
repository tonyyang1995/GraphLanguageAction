Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C=CC(=O)Nc1cccc(Oc2[n-]c(=Nc3ccc(N4CC[NH+](C)CC4)c(F)c3)nc3[nH]ccc23)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with a benzene ring system, a carbonyl group, and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle. This suggests it could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors that interact with similar functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and a nitrogen atom (N) in the molecule indicates it might be involved in interactions with proteins containing catalytic sites or binding pockets that include these functional groups. This hints at potential interactions with enzymes or receptors.
Step 3: The nitrogen-containing heterocycle and the overall structure suggest the molecule could be a ligand for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) or muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4). These receptors are known to bind small molecules with similar functional groups.
Step 4: Given the structural similarity to known inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), the molecule may also interact with these enzymes, potentially affecting their activity.
Step 5: Considering the presence of a benzene ring and a nitro group, the molecule might also interact with enzymes or receptors involved in neurotransmitter signaling, such as dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) and serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
Summary of related gene names:
- ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2
- CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4
- CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4
- DRD2, DRD3, DRD4
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
The molecule is likely to be related to these genes due to its structural features and the functional groups present, which can interact with various types of enzymes and receptors. The relationships are based on the ability of the molecule to fit into or bind with the active sites or binding pockets of these proteins.
