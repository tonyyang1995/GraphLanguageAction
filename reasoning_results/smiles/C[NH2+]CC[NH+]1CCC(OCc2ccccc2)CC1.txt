Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH2+]CC[NH+]1CCC(OCc2ccccc2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (N+), which suggests it may be an amine derivative. This structural feature is relevant to several receptors and enzymes that interact with amine compounds.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a benzene ring with a hydroxyl group (-OH) and an ether linkage (O-C), which are characteristic of certain ligands for receptors such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structure could potentially interact with receptors like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are dopamine receptors.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of multiple carbon chains and rings indicates a complex organic structure, which might influence the binding affinity and specificity for certain enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2D6 and CYP3A4.
Step 4: The overall complexity and the presence of functional groups suggest that this molecule could interact with a variety of proteins, but the most likely interactions would be with those involved in neurotransmitter signaling and drug metabolism.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes are primarily involved in neurotransmitter signaling and drug metabolism pathways. The related gene names include: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.
