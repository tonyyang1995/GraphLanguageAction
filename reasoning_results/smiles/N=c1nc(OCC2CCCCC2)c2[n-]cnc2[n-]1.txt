Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N=c1nc(OCC2CCCCC2)c2[n-]cnc2[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a structure that includes an imidazole ring, a pyrrolidine ring, and several aromatic rings, which are characteristic features of many drugs targeting G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of multiple nitrogen atoms, particularly in the imidazole and pyrrolidine rings, suggests that this molecule could potentially interact with proteins containing histidine residues, such as GPCRs, which often have histidine-containing intracellular loops that serve as allosteric sites for drug binding.
Step 3: The aromatic rings and potential for hydrogen bonding due to the oxygen atom in the pyrrolidine ring suggest that this molecule may be capable of interacting with enzymes involved in phase I and II metabolic pathways, such as CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize a wide range of drugs.
Step 4: Given the structural features, the molecule might be designed to target GPCRs involved in neurotransmission, such as HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, and DRD3, which are known to play roles in serotonin and dopamine signaling pathways.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the related genes include: CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, and DRD3. Summary: CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3. Step 5: Summary: The related genes include CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, and DRD3. These genes are associated with drug metabolism and neurotransmission. 
Note: The gene list provided is based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions with known drug targets. Other genes not listed here might also be relevant depending on additional context or experimental evidence. However, based on the provided information, the focus is on those genes directly related to the molecule's likely pharmacological profile.
