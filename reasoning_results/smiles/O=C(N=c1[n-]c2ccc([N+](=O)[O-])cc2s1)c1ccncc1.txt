Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(N=c1[n-]c2ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc2s1)c1ccncc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex molecule with a central nitrogen atom that forms part of an aromatic ring system and is connected to a pyrrole ring, a pyridine ring, and a substituted benzene ring. The presence of a nitrile group (-CN) and amide groups (-CONH-) indicates potential pharmacological activity. This suggests the molecule could interact with proteins involved in signal transduction or enzyme function.
Step 2: Analyzing the genes listed, those involved in neurotransmitter systems and receptor binding are particularly relevant. For example, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C encode serotonin receptors, which often interact with molecules containing amide groups and aromatic rings. Additionally, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4 encode dopamine receptors, which might also be targeted by the molecule due to its structural features.
Step 3: The molecule's ability to form hydrogen bonds and its overall hydrophobicity suggest it could interact with membrane-bound proteins like G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). The presence of a nitrile group and amide groups could facilitate such interactions, making the molecule potentially relevant to genes encoding GPCRs.
Step 4: Given the molecule's structure, it may also interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These enzymes are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics, and the molecule's chemical structure aligns with substrates for these enzymes.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions with proteins, the related genes include: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These genes are involved in neurotransmission, hormone signaling, and drug metabolism.
