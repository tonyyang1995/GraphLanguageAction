Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(N=c1[n-]nc(-c2ccncc2)s1)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring with multiple substituents, including a cyano group (-CN), a nitroso group (N=CN), and a sulfoxide group (S=O). These structural features suggest that the molecule could potentially interact with proteins involved in drug metabolism and signaling pathways.
Step 2: Among the given genes, several are known to be involved in drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics. Specifically, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 encode enzymes that are part of the cytochrome P450 family, which plays a crucial role in the metabolism of many drugs. The presence of functional groups such as the cyano and sulfoxide groups in the molecule might influence its interaction with these enzymes, potentially affecting its metabolic stability and bioavailability.
Step 3: Additionally, some of the genes listed are associated with neurotransmitter receptors or signaling pathways that could be modulated by this molecule. For instance, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C encode serotonin receptors, which are known to be influenced by various psychoactive compounds. The pattern of substituents in the molecule, particularly the nitrogen-containing groups, could allow it to interact with these receptors, altering their function.
Step 4: Furthermore, the molecule's structure might also interact with other G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) mentioned in the list, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, and ADRB2, which are involved in the regulation of physiological processes like blood pressure and heart rate. The presence of a cyano group and the overall topology of the molecule could enable it to bind to these receptors, potentially affecting their activity.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names based on the described interactions, the following genes are likely to be related to the molecule: CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, and ADRB2. These genes encode proteins that are either directly involved in drug metabolism or have receptor functions that could be modulated by the molecule's structure.
