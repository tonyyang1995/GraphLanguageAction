Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(OCc2cc(C(=O)[NH+](C)Cc3cnn(-c4ccccc4C)c3)no2)cn1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure containing several functional groups such as an aromatic ring (indicated by 'c' in the SMILES string), a carbonyl group (indicated by 'C(=O)', and amine groups ('[NH+]'). The presence of these groups suggests the molecule could be involved in interactions with proteins that have binding sites for aromatic compounds, carbonyls, or amines.
Step 2: Considering the gene features, the molecule's structure aligns well with the binding preferences of receptors like DRD2 (Dopamine D2 receptor) which has a high affinity for aromatic compounds and amine groups. Additionally, the carbonyl group might interact with enzymes like CYP2D6, known for metabolizing compounds with this functional group.
Step 3: The molecule also has a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring (indicated by 'N' in the SMILES string), which is characteristic of ligands for receptors such as HTR2A (Serotonin 5-HT2A receptor) and HTR2B, which bind to aminergic compounds.
Step 4: The presence of a benzene ring and other aromatic functionalities could suggest potential interactions with proteins encoded by genes like ABCB1 (Multidrug resistance protein 1), which are known to transport substrates with aromatic rings.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its likely interactions with various proteins, the most closely related genes include: DRD2, CYP2D6, HTR2A, HTR2B, ABCB1.
Summary of Related Genes:
- DRD2
- CYP2D6
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- ABCB1 Step 5: Summary of Related Genes:
- ABCB1
These genes are most likely to be directly or indirectly influenced by the molecule due to their protein products' ability to interact with its functional groups.
