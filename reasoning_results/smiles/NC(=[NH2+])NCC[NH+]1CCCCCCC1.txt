Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: NC(=[NH2+])NCC[NH+]1CCCCCCC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring system, specifically a pyrrolidine ring with a positive charge on the nitrogen atom. This structural feature suggests potential interactions with proteins that have binding sites for similar nitrogen-containing moieties or positively charged regions.
Step 2: The presence of multiple aromatic rings, particularly the benzene rings, indicates that the molecule may interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism such as those encoded by CYP (cytochrome P450) genes. For example, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are known to metabolize various drugs through oxidative reactions involving aromatic rings.
Step 3: The molecule has a quaternary amine structure, which could potentially bind to ion channels or receptors with similar functional groups. Genes encoding ion channels or receptors like HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A) and KCNH2 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2) might be influenced by this feature.
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule, including its size and shape, might facilitate binding to large protein complexes such as those involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways. Genes encoding GPCRs like DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), HTR2B (serotonin receptor 2B), and HRH1 (histamine receptor H1) could be relevant due to their involvement in neurotransmission.
Step 5: Considering the molecular features and potential interactions, the related genes include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A, DRD2, HTR2B, HRH1, KCNH2.
