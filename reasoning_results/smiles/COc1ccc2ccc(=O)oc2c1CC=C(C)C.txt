Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc2ccc(=O)oc2c1CC=C(C)C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a molecule that contains a benzene ring system and an oxazole ring, connected via a methylene group. This structural pattern is characteristic of several drugs and small molecules involved in pharmacological interactions with receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: Analyzing the molecule's functional groups, it includes an amide (–CONH–) and a carboxylic acid (–COOH) group. These functional groups are common in ligands that interact with receptors such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are encoded by genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a benzene ring, which is also seen in the molecule, suggests potential interaction with cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which metabolize many drugs.
Step 4: Considering the overall structure and the presence of a carboxylic acid, the molecule could also be a substrate for enzymes like CYP3A4, which is involved in the metabolism of various drugs.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule may have significant interactions with the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. These genes encode proteins involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism.
