Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOC(=O)Cn1nc(Cc2ccccc2)c2ccccc2c1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples or additional text.
Step 1: The molecule has a core structure consisting of a benzene ring attached to an oxetane ring, which is further linked to a phenyl ring through an amide bond. This structure is characteristic of many drugs that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as adrenergic and cholinergic receptors.
Step 2: The presence of multiple aromatic rings suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, specifically CYP enzymes like CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, which are known to metabolize a wide range of drugs including those affecting neurotransmitter systems.
Step 3: The molecule's ability to bind to and modulate receptor activity, particularly due to its structural similarity to neurotransmitters and other signaling molecules, indicates it could have effects on genes encoding GPCRs, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 4: Additionally, given the molecule's potential to influence neurotransmission, it may also affect genes involved in the modulation of neuronal function and response to neurotransmitters, including DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
Step 5: Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4. Step 5: Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
