Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(CSc1nnc(CNc2ccc(F)cc2)o1)OC1CCCCC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing multiple functional groups such as an amide (C=O), aromatic rings (Phenyl, F), and a heterocyclic ring (Pyridine). It also has hydrophobic and polar regions, indicating its potential for interactions with membrane proteins and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a pyridine ring and a phenolic group (OH) suggests that this molecule could interact with receptors that have similar chemical moieties, particularly those involved in neurotransmission and hormone signaling. This aligns with the presence of several G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels among the listed genes.
Step 3: The molecule’s structure includes a benzene ring with a substituted nitrogen, which is characteristic of ligands that can bind to receptors like adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a quinolone-like structure (quinoline ring system) in the molecule might be relevant to the CYP2C9 gene, which encodes an enzyme that metabolizes drugs containing quinoline derivatives.
Step 5: Considering the diverse functional groups and the potential for interaction with various targets, the most likely related genes are those involved in neurotransmission, hormone signaling, and drug metabolism. These include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19.
