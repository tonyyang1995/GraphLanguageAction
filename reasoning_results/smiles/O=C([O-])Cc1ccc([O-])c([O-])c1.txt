Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])Cc1ccc([O-])c([O-])c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a structure that includes an oxygen double bond (O=C) and two negatively charged oxygen atoms (-O-), which are part of a cyclic structure. This suggests the molecule could be involved in interactions with receptors or enzymes that recognize and bind to specific chemical structures.
Step 2: The cyclic structure with negatively charged oxygens (-O-) indicates potential interactions with ion channels or receptors that have binding sites for negatively charged molecules or ions. For instance, this pattern might suggest interactions with voltage-gated calcium channels, which often have binding sites for negatively charged ligands.
Step 3: Given the presence of the cyclic structure and the negatively charged oxygens, the molecule could interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are known to bind to various ligands, including negatively charged molecules, and are involved in numerous physiological processes, such as neurotransmission and hormone signaling.
Step 4: Considering the interaction possibilities with GPCRs, the molecule may be related to several genes that encode GPCRs, such as HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A), HTR2B (serotonin receptor 2B), and HTR2C (serotonin receptor 2C). These receptors play key roles in the central nervous system and are involved in mood regulation, anxiety, and other neurological functions.
Step 5: The molecule also shows structural features that could potentially interact with enzymes like CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs and xenobiotics. However, the primary focus based on the described structure is more aligned with receptor interactions rather than enzymatic activity.
