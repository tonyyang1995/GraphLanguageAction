Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])c1cc(-c2ccco2)nc2ccccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule provided is a complex organic compound, likely a drug or a small molecule inhibitor, based on its structure which includes a benzene ring, a carbonyl group, and a negatively charged oxygen atom. The presence of a benzene ring and a carbonyl group suggests it could interact with proteins that have binding sites for such functional groups.
Step 2: Considering the molecular structure, it is plausible that this molecule could interact with receptors or enzymes that contain similar functional groups. For example, it might bind to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are known to have binding sites for ligands with hydrophobic cores and polar headgroups, which aligns with the benzene ring and the negatively charged oxygen.
Step 3: Given the presence of a benzene ring and a carbonyl group, the molecule might also interact with enzymes involved in metabolism or signaling pathways, such as those encoded by CYP (cytochrome P450) genes, which are known to metabolize drugs and other xenobiotics.
Step 4: Furthermore, the molecule's structure suggests potential interactions with ion channels, particularly those encoded by genes like KCNH2, which codes for the hERG potassium channel, due to the presence of charged functional groups that could affect ion permeability.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule could be related to several genes, including those encoding GPCRs (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) and those involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
Summary of related gene names:
- GPCRs: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- Drug Metabolism: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4
Note: Other genes listed do not seem directly related to the molecular structure described. Therefore, they are not included in the summary.
