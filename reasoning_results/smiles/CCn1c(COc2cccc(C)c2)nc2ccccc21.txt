Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCn1c(COc2cccc(C)c2)nc2ccccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string (CCn1c(COc2cccc(C)c2)nc2ccccc21) represents a molecule that contains a tricyclic core structure, specifically a benzene ring fused with two additional rings. This type of molecular structure often interacts with proteins involved in neurotransmission and receptor binding.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and a substituted amine group (indicated by 'n' and 'CO') suggest potential interactions with receptors that have similar chemical features. Benzene rings are common in ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are encoded by several of the listed genes.
Step 3: Given the substituents and the overall topology of the molecule, it could interact with GPCRs such as DRD2 (Dopamine Receptor D2), HTR2A (Serotonin Receptor 5-HT1A), and HTR2B (Serotonin Receptor 5-HT2B). These receptors play key roles in neurotransmission and are known to be modulated by various drugs.
Step 4: The molecule's structure also aligns well with known ligands for CYP enzymes, particularly CYP2D6, which is involved in the metabolism of many drugs and endogenous substances.
Step 5: Considering the above points, the related genes are likely to be those encoding receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism, including but not limited to: DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, CYP2D6.
