Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(OC)c2[n-]c(=O)c(CCNC(=O)C3CCCCC3)cc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex molecule that includes a benzene ring system, a pyrrole ring, an amide group, and a heterocyclic nitrogen atom. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes and receptors that have specific binding sites for similar chemical motifs.
Step 2: Notably, the molecule contains a quinolone-like structure (quinoline derivative) and an indole ring, which are common in drugs that interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These enzymes are involved in the metabolism of many pharmaceuticals and xenobiotics.
Step 3: The presence of an amide and a heterocyclic nitrogen could also indicate potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are known to bind to various ligands including amides and heterocycles.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure might be relevant to genes involved in neurotransmitter signaling pathways, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which encode serotonin receptors. Serotonin receptors often have affinity for amides and heterocycles in their ligands.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C. 
Summary of related gene names: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C.
