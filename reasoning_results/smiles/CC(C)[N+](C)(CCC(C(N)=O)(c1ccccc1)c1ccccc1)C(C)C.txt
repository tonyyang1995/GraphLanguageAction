Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)[N+](C)(CCC(C(N)=O)(c1ccccc1)c1ccccc1)C(C)C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a quinolone-like structure with a nitrogen atom that carries a positive charge, which is typical for many drugs targeting G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This pattern suggests the molecule may interact with receptors involved in neurotransmission.
Step 2: The presence of multiple aromatic rings, particularly the benzene rings, indicates potential binding sites for enzymes involved in drug metabolism such as cytochrome P450s (CYPs), specifically CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These enzymes are responsible for metabolizing many drugs.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which is often found in compounds that act as agonists or antagonists for GPCRs, such as adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors. This feature points towards possible interactions with genes encoding these receptors like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule’s structure might facilitate its interaction with ion channels, given the presence of charged groups and hydrophobic regions. This could potentially affect genes associated with ion channel function, such as KCNH2, which encodes the hERG potassium channel.
Step 5: Considering the above structural features, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes involved in neurotransmission and drug metabolism, including but not limited to: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, KCNH2.
