Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(C(=O)[O-])cc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule, represented by the SMILES string COc1ccc(C(=O)[O-])cc1OC, has a chemical structure that includes a benzene ring (c1cc1), an amide group (C(=O)[O-]), and an alcohol group (OC). This structure suggests that the molecule could be a derivative of a benzodiazepine or a similar compound.
Step 2: The presence of the amide and alcohol groups indicates that this molecule likely interacts with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, neurotransmitter systems, or enzymatic reactions. These functional groups are common in molecules that modulate the activity of receptors, transporters, or enzymes.
Step 3: Considering the molecular structure, it is plausible that this compound might interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or enzymes such as cytochrome P450s (CYP enzymes). GPCRs are known to have binding sites for ligands with amide and hydroxyl functionalities, while CYP enzymes require substrates with aromatic rings and polar functional groups.
Step 4: Given the interaction possibilities with GPCRs and CYP enzymes, we can infer that this molecule may be related to genes encoding for these types of proteins. Specifically, it could be associated with genes involved in neurotransmission, signal transduction, and drug metabolism.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the related genes include those encoding G-protein coupled receptors (e.g., CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HRH1), enzymes from the cytochrome P450 family (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), and other genes involved in neurotransmission and receptor signaling (e.g., DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CNR1, PTGS1).
Summary of related gene names:
- CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HRH1
- CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4
- DRD2, DRD3, DRD4
- CNR1, PTGS1
Note: The remaining genes listed do not seem directly related to the molecule's structure based on the provided information. They may be involved in other biological processes not directly linked to the described molecule. Step 1: The given molecule, represented by the SMILES string COc1ccc(C(=O)[O-])cc1OC, has a chemical structure that includes a benzene ring (c1cc1), an amide group (C(=O)[O-]), and an alcohol group (OC). This structure suggests that the molecule could be a derivative of a benzodiazepine or a similar compound.
Step 2: The presence of the amide and alcohol groups indicates potential interactions with proteins involved in neurotransmitter systems, particularly G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: Considering the molecular structure, the amide group might interact with receptors like dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DR
