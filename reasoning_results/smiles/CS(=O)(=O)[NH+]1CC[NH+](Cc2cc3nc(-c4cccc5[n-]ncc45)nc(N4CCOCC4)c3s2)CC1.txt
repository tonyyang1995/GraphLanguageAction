Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CS(=O)(=O)[NH+]1CC[NH+](Cc2cc3nc(-c4cccc5[n-]ncc45)nc(N4CCOCC4)c3s2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a molecule that is likely an inhibitor of CYP (Cytochrome P450) enzymes, specifically CYP2D6 and CYP2C19. This is evident from the presence of a quinolone-like core structure, which is a common feature of CYP inhibitors.
Step 2: The molecule also contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), which is characteristic of drugs that inhibit CYP enzymes, particularly CYP2C19. The presence of this functional group suggests that the molecule may have a significant interaction with CYP2C19, affecting its activity.
Step 3: Given the structure and the known interactions of similar compounds, it is reasonable to infer that the molecule could modulate the expression or function of genes involved in drug metabolism and transport, such as those encoding CYP enzymes and their regulators. Therefore, we should consider genes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are directly involved in drug metabolism via CYP enzymes.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure might indirectly influence genes involved in neurotransmitter systems, given that CYP enzymes play a role in the metabolism of neurotransmitters. Genes such as DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), HTR1A (Serotonin receptor 1A), and SLC6A4 (Solute carrier family 6 member 4, which includes the serotonin transporter) could be affected due to changes in neurotransmitter levels.
Step 5: Based on the analysis, the genes most likely to be related to this molecule are: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR1A, and SLC6A4. These genes are directly or indirectly influenced by the molecule's structure and potential pharmacological effects.
