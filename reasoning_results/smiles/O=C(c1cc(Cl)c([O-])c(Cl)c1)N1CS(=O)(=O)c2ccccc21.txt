Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(c1cc(Cl)c([O-])c(Cl)c1)N1CS(=O)(=O)c2ccccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring fused to a benzene ring, which is characteristic of many ligands that interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature suggests potential interactions with genes encoding for GPCRs.
Step 2: The molecule also has a carboxamide group (-CONH2) and a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), which are common functional groups in drugs targeting enzymes such as CYP enzymes involved in drug metabolism. This indicates possible interactions with genes like CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
Step 3: The presence of a nitrile group (-CN) and an ester group (-COOR) in the molecule could suggest involvement in signaling pathways modulated by receptors and ion channels, possibly interacting with genes such as HTR2A and KCNH2.
Step 4: The overall structure and functional groups of the molecule hint at its potential to inhibit or activate enzymes and receptors, which could be related to genes involved in signal transduction and neurotransmission.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and functional groups identified, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, HTR2A, HTR2B, KCNH2, LCK, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
Summary of related gene names: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, HTR2A, HTR2B, KCNH2, LCK, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
