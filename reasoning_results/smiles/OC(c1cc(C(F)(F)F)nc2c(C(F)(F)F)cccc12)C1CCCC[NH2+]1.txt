Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: OC(c1cc(C(F)(F)F)nc2c(C(F)(F)F)cccc12)C1CCCC[NH2+]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is common in many drug-like molecules due to its aromatic stability and ability to form hydrogen bonds. This structural feature is relevant to several genes involved in drug metabolism and transport, such as CYP (Cytochrome P450) enzymes and transporters like ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein).
Step 2: The presence of fluorine atoms (F) attached to the benzene rings indicates potential for high lipophilicity and enhanced membrane permeability, which are important for drug delivery and absorption. This property is particularly relevant to genes like ABCB1, which encodes a protein that transports drugs across cell membranes.
Step 3: The molecule includes a pyrrolidine ring, which can form hydrogen bonds and participate in various biological interactions. This structural element is relevant to receptors and ion channels, such as those encoded by HTR2A (serotonin receptor) and KCNH2 (potassium channel), respectively.
Step 4: The presence of a quinoline ring in the molecule suggests potential interaction with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9 and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize numerous drugs.
Step 5: Given the complex structure and multiple functional groups, this molecule likely interacts with multiple targets, including those encoded by CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and other CYP enzymes, which play crucial roles in drug metabolism.
