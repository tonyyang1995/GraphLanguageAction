Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc2[n-]cnc(=Nc3cccc([O-])c3)c2cc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex molecule containing a heterocyclic ring system with multiple functional groups such as amine (-NH2), nitroso (N-), carbonyl (C=O), and hydroxyl (OH) functionalities. This structure suggests potential interactions with receptors or enzymes that recognize similar chemical motifs.
Step 2: The molecule includes an amine group (-NH2) and a nitroso group (N-), which are often recognized by various G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). These receptors include adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2), muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), and dopaminergic receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4). The presence of these functional groups suggests the molecule may interact with these receptors.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a carboxylic acid group (COOH) and an alcohol group (OH), which could interact with enzymes involved in metabolism such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. These cytochrome P450 enzymes are responsible for the oxidation of many drugs and xenobiotics, and their interaction could influence drug efficacy and toxicity.
Step 4: The presence of a nitroso group (N-) indicates potential redox-active properties, which could be relevant to enzymes like KCNH2 (a potassium channel protein) and PTGS1 (cyclooxygenase), both of which are involved in redox signaling and inflammation.
Step 5: Considering the above structural features, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, KCNH2, PTGS1. 
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, KCNH2, PTGS1.
