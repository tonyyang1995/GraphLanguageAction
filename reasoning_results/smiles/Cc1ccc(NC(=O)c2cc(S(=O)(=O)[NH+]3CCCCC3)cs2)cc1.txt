Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(NC(=O)c2cc(S(=O)(=O)[NH+]3CCCCC3)cs2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a nitrogen atom attached through a carboxamide group (N-C(=O)), which is a common pharmacophore for drugs that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature suggests potential interaction with receptors such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are dopamine receptors.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)) attached to another nitrogen atom, which is known to interact with ion channels and transporters. This could be relevant to genes encoding ion channels like KCNH2 or transporters like SLC6A2 and SLC6A4.
Step 3: The presence of a phenyl ring system and a quinoline-like structure may indicate interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4, which are cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Step 4: The overall structure with multiple functional groups (amides, sulfonamides, and aromatic rings) and its potential to modulate receptor activity and enzyme function suggest it could have broader effects on various signaling pathways, including those involving HRH1, HTR1A, and ESR1.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, KCNH2, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, HRH1, HTR1A, and ESR1. Step 1: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4
Step 2: KCNH2, SLC6A2, SLC6A4
Step 3: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4
Step 4: HRH1, HTR1A
Step 5: ESR1
