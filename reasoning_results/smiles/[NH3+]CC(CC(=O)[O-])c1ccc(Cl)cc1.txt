Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [NH3+]CC(CC(=O)[O-])c1ccc(Cl)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule, represented by the SMILES string [NH3+]CC(CC(=O)[O-])c1ccc(Cl)cc1, contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (N+), a benzene ring, an amide group (-COO-), and a chlorine atom. The presence of a positively charged nitrogen and a benzene ring suggests that this molecule could be a potential ligand for receptors or enzymes that interact with such structural features.
Step 2: The positively charged nitrogen in the molecule could potentially interact with negatively charged residues in receptor proteins, such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This interaction could modulate the activity of these receptors, which are often involved in various physiological processes and are targets for many drugs.
Step 3: The amide group in the molecule might also interact with certain enzymes, particularly those involved in metabolism and drug-drug interactions. For instance, enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 are known to metabolize drugs containing amide groups, and the presence of such a functional group in our molecule could indicate its potential role in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.
Step 4: Given the presence of a benzene ring and the overall structure of the molecule, it is plausible that it could bind to ion channels, particularly those that have hydrophobic binding sites. For example, the CACNA1H gene encodes a calcium channel subunit, and other genes like KCNH2, which codes for a potassium channel, might also be relevant due to their hydrophobic regions.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule may be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, PTGS1, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4. These genes encode receptors, enzymes, and ion channels that could interact with the molecule through specific binding sites.
Summary of Related Genes:
- ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1
- CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4
- DRD2, DRD3, DRD4
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- KCNH2, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1
- PTGS1, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4
These genes are associated with receptors, enzymes, and ion channels that might interact with the given molecule based on its structure. Further experimental validation would be necessary to confirm these interactions.
