Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(N=c2nc3c(c[n-]2)CN(c2cc(NC(=O)c4cccc(C(F)(F)F)c4)ccc2C)C(=O)N3C)cn1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings, including aromatic rings and a heterocyclic nitrogen-containing ring. It also contains functional groups such as amides, esters, and amine functionalities, which are common in drug molecules.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (C(=O)N) suggests potential interactions with enzymes that metabolize drugs, such as those encoded by CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4. These enzymes are involved in the metabolism of various drugs, including antidepressants and painkillers.
Step 3: The amine group (N) and the ester functionality (C(=O)O) indicate that the molecule could interact with receptors or transport proteins. For instance, the amine group might bind to adrenergic receptors like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, and CHRM1-4, which are involved in neurotransmission. The ester group might interact with cholinergic receptors like CHRM1-4.
Step 4: The molecule's overall structure, particularly the presence of amide and ester groups, could also suggest potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This is relevant to genes such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode serotonin receptors, and HRH1, which encodes a hormone receptor.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and functional groups identified, the related genes include: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and HRH1.
