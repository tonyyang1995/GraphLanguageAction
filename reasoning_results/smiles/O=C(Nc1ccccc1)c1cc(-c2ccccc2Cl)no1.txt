Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Nc1ccccc1)c1cc(-c2ccccc2Cl)no1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a quinoline-like structure, which includes a benzene ring fused to a pyridine ring. This structural feature suggests that the molecule may interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a cyano group (-CN) and chlorine substituents in the molecule indicates potential interactions with enzymes involved in phase I and phase II metabolic pathways, such as those encoded by CYP (cytochrome P450) and SLC (solute carrier) families.
Step 3: Given the molecular structure, it is plausible that the molecule could influence the activity of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are associated with several of the listed genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4. These receptors are known to be modulated by various drugs and chemicals due to their role in neurotransmission and hormone signaling.
Step 4: Considering the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and the overall chemical nature of the molecule, it might also affect enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways, such as kinases, which are represented by genes like LCK, PTGS1, and HRH1.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule could be related to the following genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, PTGS1, LCK, HRH1.
