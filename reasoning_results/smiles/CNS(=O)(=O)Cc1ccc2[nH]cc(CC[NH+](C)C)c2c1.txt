Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CNS(=O)(=O)Cc1ccc2[nH]cc(CC[NH+](C)C)c2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a structure that includes a central nitrogen atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom (CON), a carboxylic acid group (COOH), and a pyrrolidine ring with a nitrogen atom carrying a positive charge (N+). This structure suggests it could be an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor or a related compound, given its functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of the positively charged nitrogen and the carboxylic acid group in the molecule indicates potential interactions with ion channels, receptors, and enzymes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism. Specifically, this pattern is characteristic of molecules that interact with cholinergic systems.
Step 3: The cholinergic system involves several genes related to acetylcholine receptors and transporters. These include CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, which encode muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, and SLC6A4, which encodes the vesicular acetylcholine transporter.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure might also interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like HTR2A and HTR2B, which are involved in serotonin signaling, though less directly related to the primary cholinergic function.
Step 5: Given the molecule's potential to interact with cholinergic pathways and serotonin pathways, the related genes are CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, SLC6A4, HTR2A, and HTR2B.
Summary of Related Genes: CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, SLC6A4, HTR2A, HTR2B.
