Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cn1cnnc1SCC(=O)n1c2ccccc2c2ccccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with a pyrrole fused to it, and a sulfonamide group attached to the nitrogen of the pyrrole. This structure is characteristic of many inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2D6.
Step 2: CYP2D6 is involved in the metabolism of various drugs, including those that modulate neurotransmitter systems such as dopamine and serotonin. The molecule's structure suggests it may interact with CYP2D6.
Step 3: The presence of a benzene ring and amine group also indicates potential interactions with receptors like DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2) and HTR2A (serotonin receptor 5-HT2A), which are known targets for drugs affecting neurotransmission.
Step 4: Given the molecular structure and its potential interactions with CYP2D6 and neurotransmitter receptors, the related genes include CYP2D6, DRD2, and HTR2A.
Step 5: Summary of related genes: CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with a pyrrole fused to it, and a sulfonamide group attached to the nitrogen of the pyrrole.
