Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Nc1cccc2cccnc12)c1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other type of explanation.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring fused to a benzene ring, which is characteristic of certain ligands for the cannabinoid receptor (CB1). This structure is similar to molecules that interact with the cannabinoid receptor, such as anandamide and THC.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH2) and a quaternary ammonium salt group ([N+](=O)[O-]) suggests the molecule could act as a modulator of ion channels, specifically the voltage-gated calcium channel (CACNA1H).
Step 3: The molecule also has a nitrile group (-CN) and a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH), which are common in compounds that can act as substrates or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2C9 and CYP2C19.
Step 4: Given the overall structure, the molecule may also interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), specifically D2-like dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) due to its potential to bind to the extracellular domain of these receptors.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and interactions described, the related genes are: CNR1, CACNA1H, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4. 
Summary: CNR1, CACNA1H, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4. Step 5: Summary: CNR1, CACNA1H, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
