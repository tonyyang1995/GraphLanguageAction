Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CN(C)c1ccccc1C[NH+]1CCC[NH+](Cc2ccccc2N(C)C)C1c1ccncc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains multiple aromatic rings and heteroatoms such as nitrogen and oxygen, which are common features in ligands that interact with receptors or enzymes. The presence of a pyrrole ring (indicated by 'N' in the SMILES string) and a quinoline-like structure (indicated by 'c1cccc1' pattern) suggests potential interactions with receptors that have similar functional groups.
Step 2: The molecule also includes amine functionalities, specifically amidinium groups ('[NH+]'), which are known to form hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions with proteins. These interactions can be crucial for binding to receptors like G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which often have binding sites for small molecules containing basic moieties.
Step 3: Considering the pattern of the molecule and its functional groups, it could potentially interact with receptors involved in neurotransmitter signaling, such as adrenergic and cholinergic receptors, as well as other GPCRs. For example, the presence of amine groups and aromatic rings could suggest interactions with receptors like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are known to bind small molecules through similar mechanisms.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule’s structure might also be relevant to enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, due to the presence of functional groups that could be substrates for these cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule may be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
