Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(CSc2nc(=O)c3c([n-]2)CCC3)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is common in many drug molecules and can interact with various receptors and transporters.
Step 2: The presence of a thiazole ring (CSc2nc(=O)c3c([n-]2)) suggests potential interactions with enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs.
Step 3: The molecule has a phenylalanine-like substituent (CSc2nc(=O)c3c([n-]2)CCC3), which could potentially interact with receptors such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are dopamine receptors.
Step 4: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) indicates possible interaction with genes involved in metabolic pathways, such as PTGS1, which encodes for COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes.
Step 5: The overall structure may also interact with transporters like SLC6A2 and SLC6A4, which are involved in the reuptake of neurotransmitters.
Summary of related gene names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
