Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCOc1cc(CC2CNC(=O)N2)ccc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure including multiple rings and functional groups such as ester, amide, and alcohol functionalities. Notably, it contains an aromatic ring system with a benzene ring and a substituted phenol group, which are common in many drug molecules that interact with various receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and the amide group suggests this molecule could potentially act as a ligand for proteins involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways. This is because many drugs targeting GPCRs contain similar structural elements to facilitate binding to the receptor's active site.
Step 3: The amide functionality in the molecule also indicates it may be a substrate for enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2D6 and CYP2C9, which are known to metabolize amide-containing compounds. These enzymes are part of the cytochrome P450 superfamily and play crucial roles in detoxifying xenobiotics and metabolizing drugs.
Step 4: Given the presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group, this molecule might interact with proteins that have metal ion binding sites or are involved in calcium signaling, such as KCNH2 (a voltage-gated potassium channel) and HRH1 (histamine H1 receptor). These interactions could modulate the activity of these proteins, leading to potential pharmacological effects.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes include those involved in GPCR signaling (e.g., DRD2, DRD3, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C), drug metabolism (e.g., CYP2D6, CYP2C9), and ion channels (e.g., KCNH2). Other genes like EGFR and PTGS1, while not directly related to the molecule's structure, could still be affected due to their roles in cellular signaling and inflammation, respectively.
