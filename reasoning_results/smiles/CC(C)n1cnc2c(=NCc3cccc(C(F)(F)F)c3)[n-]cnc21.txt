Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)n1cnc2c(=NCc3cccc(C(F)(F)F)c3)[n-]cnc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule, which appears to contain aromatic rings, heteroatoms (nitrogens), and fluorine atoms. This suggests the molecule could interact with proteins that bind to or metabolize similar functional groups.
Step 2: Analyzing the molecular structure for potential pharmacophores, we see the presence of amide, nitrile, and aromatic functionalities. These functional groups are often involved in binding to enzymes and receptors, particularly those that catalyze drug metabolism or are targets for psychoactive substances.
Step 3: Considering the CYP (Cytochrome P450) family of enzymes, which includes CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, these enzymes are known to metabolize a wide range of drugs through oxidation reactions involving oxygen, which could be relevant given the presence of aromatic rings and heteroatoms in the molecule.
Step 4: The molecule also contains nitrogen atoms and potentially could form hydrogen bonds, which might interact with receptors like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4 (Dopamine Receptors) or HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 (Serotonin Receptors), as these receptors often have binding sites for nitrogen-containing ligands.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6) and the dopamine and serotonin receptor families (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).
