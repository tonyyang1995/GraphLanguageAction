Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COCC[NH2+]Cc1ccc(-c2cc3nccc(Oc4ccc(NC(=S)NC(=O)Cc5ccc(F)cc5)cc4F)c3s2)nc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with multiple functional groups including an amine group (-NH2), a carboxylate group (-COO-), and aromatic rings. This structure suggests potential interactions with receptors or enzymes that have binding sites for similar functional groups.
Step 2: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (+), which indicates it could be a cationic compound. Cationic compounds often interact with anionic sites on cell membranes or within cells, which might relate to ion channels or transporters.
Step 3: The presence of a benzene ring (c1ccc(-c2cc3nccc(Oc4ccc(NC(=S)NC(=O)Cc5ccc(F)cc5)cc4F)c3s2)nc1) and a cyano group (CN) suggest potential interaction with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP (cytochrome P450) genes, which are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 4: The molecule also includes a sulfonamide group (NC(=S)N) and a carboxylic acid group (COO-), both of which are common in drugs that act as ligands for various receptors and ion channels. This structure might be relevant to genes encoding receptors or ion channels like G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which include DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 5: Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, this molecule is likely to interact with several genes involved in neurotransmitter signaling, drug metabolism, and receptor binding. Specifically, the related genes are: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and possibly others depending on the exact mechanism of action.
Summary of Related Genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
