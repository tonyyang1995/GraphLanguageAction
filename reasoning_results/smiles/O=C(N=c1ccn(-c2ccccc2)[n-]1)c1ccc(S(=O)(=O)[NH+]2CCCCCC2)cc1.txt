Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(N=c1ccn(-c2ccccc2)[n-]1)c1ccc(S(=O)(=O)[NH+]2CCCCCC2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrole ring, which is part of the core structure of the drug molecules that interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This suggests potential interactions with GPCRs.
Step 2: The molecule also has a quinone moiety (-S(=O)(=O)-), which is known to be involved in various cellular processes including signal transduction pathways and enzyme inhibition. It may interact with enzymes like CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule includes a nitrile group (-CN), which can participate in hydrogen bonding and can interact with proteins such as ion channels or receptors. This feature might relate to the genes encoding for ion channels and receptors, such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are involved in neurotransmission.
Step 4: The presence of a benzene ring and the overall structure of the molecule could indicate potential interactions with kinases, particularly those encoded by genes like LCK, CDK2, and KDR, which are involved in cell signaling and proliferation.
Step 5: Given the above structural features, the molecule could potentially interact with the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, LCK, MCL1, OPRL1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4.
