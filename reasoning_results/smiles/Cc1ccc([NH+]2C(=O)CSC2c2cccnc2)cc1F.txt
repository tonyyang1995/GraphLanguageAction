Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc([NH+]2C(=O)CSC2c2cccnc2)cc1F, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a quaternary ammonium group attached, which suggests potential interaction with receptors that have amine binding sites. This pattern is relevant to genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
Step 2: The presence of a thiophene ring and a sulfonyl group indicates the molecule could interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism. Specifically, this structure is pertinent to CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Step 3: The molecule includes a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group, which might indicate the ability to modulate ion channels. This feature is relevant to KCNH2, which encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel.
Step 4: The molecule’s overall structure, particularly the presence of a benzene ring and a sulfonamide group, may suggest potential interactions with nuclear receptors like NR1H2 (encoded by SIGMAR1) and others, though more specific details would be needed for a precise match.
Step 5: The molecule’s aromatic structure and potential for hydrogen bonding could also suggest interactions with kinases, such as LCK and PTGS1, although this is less direct than the interactions with the previously mentioned genes.
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, KCNH2, SIGMAR1, LCK, PTGS1.
