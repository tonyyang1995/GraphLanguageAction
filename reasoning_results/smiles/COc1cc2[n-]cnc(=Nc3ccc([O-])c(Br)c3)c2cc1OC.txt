Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc2[n-]cnc(=Nc3ccc([O-])c(Br)c3)c2cc1OC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule has several functional groups such as an amide (CON), a carboxylate (OC), a nitrile (NC), and halogenated aromatic rings (cnc(Br)c). Notably, it contains a quaternary nitrogen in a heterocyclic ring, which is common in ligands that interact with ion channels and receptors.
Step 2: The presence of a quaternary nitrogen suggests the molecule could act as a ligand for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) like adrenergic and muscarinic receptors, which are known to be regulated by CYP enzymes and other metabolic pathways.
Step 3: The nitrile group (-CN) and the halogenated aromatic ring (cnc(Br)c) indicate potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, specifically CYP enzymes such as CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which metabolize numerous drugs including those that target GPCRs.
Step 4: Given the presence of a carboxylic acid group (OC), the molecule might also interact with enzymes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism or transport, such as SLC6A2 and SLC6A4, which are involved in the reuptake of various neurotransmitters.
Step 5: Considering the above structural features, the molecule is likely to be related to genes encoding GPCRs (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4) and enzymes involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6).
Summary of related gene names:
- GPCRs: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4
- Drug Metabolism Enzymes: CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6
