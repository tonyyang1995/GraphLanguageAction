Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc2c(=Nc3ccc(Br)cc3F)[n-]cnc2cc1OCCn1ccnn1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a complex structure including aromatic rings, heteroatoms (such as nitrogen and bromine), and a hydroxyl group (-OH). These structural elements suggest that the molecule may interact with proteins involved in signal transduction, neurotransmission, and receptor binding due to their ability to form hydrogen bonds and other non-covalent interactions.
Step 2: The presence of a pyridine ring and a quinoline-like moiety in the molecule indicates potential interaction with enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs through oxidation reactions. This suggests that the molecule might be metabolized by these enzymes.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which could indicate a possible interaction with ion channels or receptors. Specifically, it may interact with KCNH2, a potassium channel subunit, given its similar chemical structure.
Step 4: The nitrogen-containing heterocycles in the molecule, particularly the imidazole ring in the amidine group, are characteristic of molecules that can bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Therefore, this structure could potentially interact with GPCRs like HTR2A and HTR2B, which are known to have such binding sites.
Step 5: Given the complexity of the molecule and its potential interactions with various biological targets, it is likely to influence the expression or function of multiple genes, including those involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways. Thus, the related genes include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, and KCNH2.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP3A4
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- KCNH2
