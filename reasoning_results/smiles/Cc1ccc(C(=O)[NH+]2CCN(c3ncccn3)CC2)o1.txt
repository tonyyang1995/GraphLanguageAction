Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(C(=O)[NH+]2CCN(c3ncccn3)CC2)o1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string contains a quinoline ring system, which is characteristic of many drugs that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). The presence of this ring system suggests potential interaction with receptors such as adrenergic and cholinergic receptors, which are known to be involved in various physiological processes and are encoded by genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a pyridine ring and an amide group, which are common in ligands for enzymes and transporters. This structural feature might indicate interactions with enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism. It could also suggest interactions with transporters such as SLC6A2 and SLC6A4, which play roles in neurotransmitter reuptake.
Step 3: Additionally, the presence of a carbonyl group and a nitrogen atom in the molecule could point towards interactions with receptors that bind to ligands with similar functional groups, such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are serotonin receptors involved in mood regulation and neurotransmission.
Step 4: The molecule's overall structure does not directly suggest strong binding to nuclear receptors like PPARγ (encoded by PPARG), which are involved in lipid metabolism and inflammation, or to kinases like LCK, which are involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interaction sites, the most likely related genes from the provided list include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4.
