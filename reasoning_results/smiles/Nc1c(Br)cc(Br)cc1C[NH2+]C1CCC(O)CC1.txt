Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Nc1c(Br)cc(Br)cc1C[NH2+]C1CCC(O)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this relationship might be significant.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom (N) that is part of a heterocyclic ring structure. This ring is likely to be involved in forming hydrogen bonds, which are important for interactions with receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The molecule also includes bromine (Br) atoms, which are polarizable and can participate in various types of non-covalent interactions such as dipole-dipole interactions and van der Waals forces. These interactions are crucial for binding to proteins like GPCRs (G protein-coupled receptors).
Step 3: The presence of a pyrrolidine ring (Nc1c(Br)cc(Br)cc1) suggests potential for interaction with ion channels or receptors that have similar functional groups. This is relevant to genes coding for ion channel proteins, such as KCNH2, which encodes the hERG potassium channel.
Step 4: The molecule has a substituted amide group (-NH2+) and an ester group (O), which could interact with enzymes or receptors through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. This is particularly relevant to genes involved in metabolic pathways, such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which encode cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Step 5: The molecule's overall structure, including its size and functional groups, may allow it to interact with multiple targets, including some GPCRs and ion channels. Genes related to these targets include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, and HRH1.
