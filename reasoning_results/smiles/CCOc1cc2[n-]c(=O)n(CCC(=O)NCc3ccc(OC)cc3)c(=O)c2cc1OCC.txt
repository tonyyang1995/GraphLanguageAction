Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCOc1cc2[n-]c(=O)n(CCC(=O)NCc3ccc(OC)cc3)c(=O)c2cc1OCC, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains multiple functional groups such as amine (-NH2), carbonyl (C=O), ester (C(=O)O), and hydroxyl (-OH). These functional groups are common in ligands that interact with receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (C(=O)N) suggests potential interactions with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or other proteins that bind amide-containing molecules. Specific GPCRs like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are involved in neurotransmitter signaling, could be targets due to the amide group.
Step 3: The ester linkage (C(=O)O) indicates the molecule might be a prodrug or an inhibitor targeting enzymes that metabolize esters, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in drug metabolism pathways.
Step 4: The presence of aromatic rings and heteroatoms (such as nitrogen in the amide and amidinium groups) suggests potential for binding to ion channels, transporters, or enzymes. For example, CNR1 (cannabinoid receptor 1) could be targeted due to the aromatic rings and nitrogen atoms.
Step 5: Given the complex structure with various functional groups, it is likely that the molecule interacts with multiple targets. However, based on the identified patterns, the most probable genes related to this molecule are DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CNR1.
