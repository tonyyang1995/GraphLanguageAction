Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+](C)CCCOc1nn(Cc2ccccc2)c2ccccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups including an amine group (-NH2), a carboxyl group (-COOH), and several aromatic rings. The presence of these groups suggests that the molecule could be involved in interactions with proteins that have similar functional groups or binding sites.
Step 2: Looking at the gene list provided, several genes are associated with receptors and enzymes that might interact with such a molecule due to their role in neurotransmission and metabolism. For example, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C are serotonin receptors which bind to various ligands and neurotransmitters. Similarly, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are enzymes involved in drug metabolism, which could interact with the molecule if it were a substrate or inhibitor.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a pyrrolidine ring, which could potentially interact with certain protein targets like the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4). These receptors are known to bind to molecules containing similar functional groups.
Step 4: Given the presence of a benzene ring and other aromatic functionalities, the molecule could also interact with enzymes like CYP3A4, which is involved in the metabolism of many drugs and xenobiotics. This interaction would likely involve the aromatic ring system of the molecule.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule appears to be most closely related to the following genes: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These genes encode proteins that either directly interact with the molecule or play a significant role in its metabolism and function within the body.
Summary of related genes: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6.
