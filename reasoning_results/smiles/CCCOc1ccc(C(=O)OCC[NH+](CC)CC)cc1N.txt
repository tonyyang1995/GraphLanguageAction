Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCOc1ccc(C(=O)OCC[NH+](CC)CC)cc1N, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule containing several functional groups such as hydroxyl (-OH), amide (C(=O)O), and aromatic rings (c1ccc(...)). These structural features suggest that the molecule could be involved in interactions with proteins that recognize or bind to similar functional groups.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (C(=O)O) indicates potential interaction with enzymes or receptors that have amine binding sites, such as those found in neurotransmitter systems. This suggests possible relevance to genes encoding for proteins involved in neurotransmission.
Step 3: The aromatic ring system and the overall molecular shape may allow for interactions with proteins involved in cell signaling pathways, particularly those with G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) activity. This points towards genes encoding GPCRs.
Step 4: Considering the presence of an amine group in the molecule and its potential for protonation (as indicated by [NH+]), it might interact with proteins that have acidic residues or positively charged binding sites. This narrows down the potential genes to those involved in ion channels or neurotransmitter transporters.
Step 5: Based on the above structural features and their implications, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes:
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6 (serotonin receptors)
- CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4 (cholinergic receptors)
- OPRK1 (opioid receptor)
- KCNH2 (potassium channel)
Summary of related gene names: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, OPRK1, KCNH2.
