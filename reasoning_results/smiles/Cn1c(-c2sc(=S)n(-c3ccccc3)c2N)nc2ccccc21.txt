Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cn1c(-c2sc(=S)n(-c3ccccc3)c2N)nc2ccccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound, identified by its SMILES string, which represents a thiosemicarbazone derivative. This structure contains a thiazole ring system and a nitrogen atom that forms a thiosemicarbazone moiety, suggesting potential for binding to proteins with nucleophilic sites.
Step 2: Analyzing the molecule's structure, it has a central nitrogen atom that is part of both the thiazole ring and the thiosemicarbazone group, which could potentially interact with amino acid residues in protein binding sites, particularly those containing sulfur-containing amino acids like cysteine, which are often involved in protein-ligand interactions.
Step 3: Considering the functional groups present, such as the amide and thioether groups, these could participate in hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions, respectively, which are common mechanisms for ligand-protein binding. The presence of these functional groups suggests the molecule might have affinity for proteins that contain regions capable of forming such interactions.
Step 4: Given the potential for interaction with proteins through these functional groups, we can infer that this molecule might be related to genes encoding proteins with similar functional domains. Specifically, this includes G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), enzymes, and ion channels, all of which can bind small molecules and modulate their activity based on the interaction.
Step 5: Based on the inferred interactions, the related genes would likely include those encoding GPCRs, such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6; enzymes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4; and ion channels like KCNH2, LCK, and SIGMAR1. These genes encode proteins that could interact directly or indirectly with the described molecule.
Summary of Related Genes:
- GPCRs: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- Enzymes: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4
- Ion Channels: KCNH2, LCK, SIGMAR1
These genes encode proteins that could potentially interact with the described molecule due to their functional groups and structural features. Further experimental validation would be required to confirm specific interactions.
