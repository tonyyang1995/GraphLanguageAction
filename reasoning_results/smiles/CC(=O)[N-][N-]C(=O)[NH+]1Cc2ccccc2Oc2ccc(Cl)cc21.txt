Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(=O)[N-][N-]C(=O)[NH+]1Cc2ccccc2Oc2ccc(Cl)cc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this relationship matters.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a carboxyl group (-COOH), a nitrogen atom with a negative charge (-N-), and a cyclic amide (CONH) group. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in neurotransmission and receptor binding.
Step 2: The presence of a negatively charged nitrogen and a cyclic amide indicates that the molecule could interact with ion channels, receptors, or enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways. This is relevant to genes encoding ion channels and receptors such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and KCNH2.
Step 3: The molecule also has a benzene ring and a phenolic hydroxyl group (O-H), which are common in molecules that can act as ligands for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This feature is particularly relevant to genes encoding GPCRs like HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and PTGS1.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring and a chlorine atom, which may contribute to its pharmacological activity by modulating enzyme activity or receptor binding affinity. This is relevant to genes involved in metabolism and drug metabolism such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule appears to be related to the following genes: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, KCNH2, PTGS1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a carboxyl group (-COOH), a nitrogen atom with a negative charge (-N-), and a cyclic amide (CONH) group. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in neurotransmission and receptor binding.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule
