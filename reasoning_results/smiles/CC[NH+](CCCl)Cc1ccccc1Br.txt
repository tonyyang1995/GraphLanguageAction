Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC[NH+](CCCl)Cc1ccccc1Br, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule represented by the SMILES string CC[NH+](CCCl)Cc1ccccc1Br consists of a benzene ring system with a positively charged nitrogen atom (N+) and attached substituents such as chlorine (Cl) and bromine (Br). The presence of a positively charged nitrogen suggests that this molecule could act as an ion channel blocker or modulator.
Step 2: The positively charged nitrogen within the molecule could interact with anionic sites in transmembrane proteins like ion channels. This interaction might affect the function of ion channels encoded by certain genes.
Step 3: Among the provided genes, those involved in encoding ion channels are ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CACNA1H, KCNH2, and LCK. These genes encode for alpha-adrenergic receptors, voltage-gated calcium channels, and LCK kinase respectively, which could be influenced by the molecule's ability to interact with anionic sites.
Step 4: The molecule's structure does not directly suggest interactions with the other genes listed, which are primarily involved in signaling pathways, drug metabolism, and receptor functions unrelated to ion channels.
Step 5: Therefore, the related genes to this molecule are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CACNA1H, KCNH2, and LCK. 
Summary of Related Gene Names:
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- ADRB2
- CACNA1H
- KCNH2
- LCK Step 5: Summary of Related Gene Names:
- LCK
These genes are primarily associated with ion channel function and may be affected by the molecule's structure and potential to modulate ion channels. Other genes listed do not have a direct structural or functional relationship with the given molecule.
