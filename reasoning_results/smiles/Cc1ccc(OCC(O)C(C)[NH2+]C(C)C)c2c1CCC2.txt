Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ccc(OCC(O)C(C)[NH2+]C(C)C)c2c1CCC2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other type of content.
Step 1: The molecule contains an aromatic ring system with multiple heteroatoms (oxygen and nitrogen), which suggests potential interactions with receptors or enzymes that have similar structural motifs. This complexity could be relevant to several genes involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction.
Step 2: The presence of a pyrrolidine ring and amine groups indicates possible interaction with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Genes such as DRD2, HTR1A, and HTR2A encode for dopamine receptors and serotonin receptors, respectively, which are known to interact with compounds containing amine functionalities.
Step 3: The molecule also has a phenolic group (-OH) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) moiety, which might indicate potential interactions with enzymes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, known for metabolizing drugs with similar functional groups. 
Step 4: The structure includes a quinolone-like motif, which could suggest interactions with genes involved in receptor modulation or signaling pathways. For instance, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, and CYP3A4 might be relevant due to their roles in receptor activation or drug metabolism.
Step 5: Given the overall structure and functional groups, the molecule is likely to interact with multiple genes involved in neurotransmitter systems, receptor signaling, and metabolic pathways. The related gene names include: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4.
Summary of related genes: DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4.
