Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cn1c(=O)cc(SCC(=O)NCC[NH+]2CCN(c3ccccc3F)CC2)c2cc(Cl)ccc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure containing multiple functional groups such as amide (C(=O)), thioether (SC), and aromatic rings (naphthalene-like). These structural features suggest that the molecule could potentially interact with proteins involved in drug metabolism or receptor binding.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (C(=O)) indicates that the molecule might be a prodrug or an inhibitor of enzymes like CYP2D6, which metabolizes many drugs through hydroxylation reactions. This suggests a potential relationship with CYP2D6.
Step 3: The aromatic rings and thioether group could indicate a potential interaction with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly those involved in neurotransmitter signaling. For instance, the molecule might bind to receptors like HTR2A (serotonin 5-HT2A receptor) due to its aromatic nature, which is common for ligands targeting these receptors.
Step 4: Given the presence of a naphthalene-like structure and the ability to form hydrogen bonds due to the amide and possibly other functional groups, the molecule could also interact with ion channels or transporters. This hints at possible interactions with genes like KCNH2 (potassium channel subfamily H member 2) or SLC6A4 (solute carrier family 6 member 4).
Step 5: Based on the above structural analysis, the molecule is likely to have a relationship with several genes involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmission, and ion channel function, including CYP2D6, HTR2A, KCNH2, and SLC6A4.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2D6
- HTR2A
- KCNH2
- SLC6A4 Step 5: Based on the structural analysis and potential interactions identified, the molecule is likely to have relationships with several genes involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmission, and ion channel function. These include CYP2D6, HTR2A, KCNH2, and SLC6A4. This summary highlights the key genes that may be relevant to the molecule's biological activity.
