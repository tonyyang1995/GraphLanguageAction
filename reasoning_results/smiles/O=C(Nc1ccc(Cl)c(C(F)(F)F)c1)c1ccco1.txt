Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Nc1ccc(Cl)c(C(F)(F)F)c1)c1ccco1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex molecule with a core structure that includes a benzene ring attached to a nitrile group (C#N), an amide group (-CONH), and multiple substituents such as fluorine (F) atoms, chlorine (Cl) atom, and a cyclohexane ring with an oxygen atom attached. This molecular structure suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways and neurotransmitter systems.
Step 2: Considering the presence of a nitrile group and amide functionality, this molecule could potentially interact with enzymes that metabolize drugs or endogenous substances. For example, it might inhibit or activate certain cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are encoded by genes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. These enzymes play crucial roles in the metabolism of various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: The presence of aromatic rings and heteroatoms (such as nitrogen and oxygen) in the molecule may also suggest potential binding to receptors or ion channels. For instance, the molecule could interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as HTR2A (serotonin 5-HT2A receptor), HTR2B (serotonin 5-HT2B receptor), and DRD2 (dopamine D2 receptor). These receptors are involved in various physiological processes including mood regulation, pain perception, and cognition.
Step 4: Given the structural complexity and functional groups present in the molecule, it might also bind to ion channels or transporters. For example, it could interact with voltage-gated potassium channels like KCNH2 or calcium channels like CACNA1H, which are encoded by the KCNH2 and CACNA1H genes, respectively. These channels are essential for maintaining cellular excitability and can be targets for therapeutic interventions.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions with enzymes and receptors, the related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, KCNH2, and CACNA1H.
