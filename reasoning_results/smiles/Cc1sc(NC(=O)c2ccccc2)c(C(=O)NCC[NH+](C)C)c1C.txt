Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1sc(NC(=O)c2ccccc2)c(C(=O)NCC[NH+](C)C)c1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule, likely a drug or a bioactive compound. It contains functional groups such as amides (N-C(=O)-), carboxylic acids (C(=O)-O-), and aromatic rings (c-c double bonds). These features suggest that the molecule could interact with receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-N-C(=O)-) indicates potential binding to receptors that have amine functionalities, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels. This could be relevant for genes encoding these types of receptors.
Step 3: The carboxylic acid group (C(=O)-O-) might interact with acidic residues in proteins, which could be important for binding to enzymes or other protein targets.
Step 4: Given the complexity and specific functional groups, this molecule could interact with multiple targets, but it is more likely to interact with genes encoding receptors and enzymes due to its chemical structure.
Step 5: Based on the analysis, the genes related to this molecule are those involved in receptor function and metabolism. Specifically, the related genes include ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and SLC6A4.
Summary of Related Genes:
- ADRA1D, ADRA2B
- ABL1
- CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C
- SLC6A4
These genes encode receptors, kinases, and enzymes that may interact with the described molecule. Further experiments would be needed to confirm the specific interactions.
