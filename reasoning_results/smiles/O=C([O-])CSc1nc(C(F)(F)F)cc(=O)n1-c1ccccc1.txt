Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])CSc1nc(C(F)(F)F)cc(=O)n1-c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure containing multiple functional groups such as an amide, an ester, and a cyano group. It also includes fluorine atoms, which are often associated with drug-like properties due to their lipophilicity and ability to modulate protein-protein interactions.
Step 2: One key feature of this molecule is its aromatic rings, particularly the benzene ring with substituents like fluorine atoms. This type of structure is commonly found in ligands for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are a large family of membrane proteins involved in various signaling pathways and are targets for many drugs.
Step 3: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) suggests that the molecule could potentially interact with ion channels or be metabolized by enzymes involved in drug metabolism. For instance, it might inhibit or activate certain ion channels or be metabolized by CYP enzymes.
Step 4: Given the complexity and potential pharmacophoric features of the molecule, it could have interactions with several genes encoding GPCRs, ion channels, and enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways. Specifically, it may target receptors such as HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A), HTR2B (serotonin receptor 2B), HTR2C (serotonin receptor 2C), and DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2).
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule’s structure could influence its metabolism through enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize various drugs.
