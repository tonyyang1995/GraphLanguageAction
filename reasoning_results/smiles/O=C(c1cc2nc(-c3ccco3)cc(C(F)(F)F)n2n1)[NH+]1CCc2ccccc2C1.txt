Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(c1cc2nc(-c3ccco3)cc(C(F)(F)F)n2n1)[NH+]1CCc2ccccc2C1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring with multiple substituents such as fluorine atoms, amide groups, and heterocyclic rings. This structure indicates that the molecule could potentially interact with proteins involved in various biological processes, including signal transduction and neurotransmission.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group and a benzene ring suggests the molecule might have affinity for receptors that bind to ligands with similar functional groups. Among the given genes, several are known to encode receptors or enzymes that interact with ligands: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HRH1.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a quinolone-like structure (quinoline ring), which could indicate potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 4: The presence of a nitrophenyl group and other polar substituents suggests the molecule may be able to form hydrogen bonds and other non-covalent interactions with proteins, potentially affecting their function. Genes encoding ion channels and transporters, such as KCNH2 and SLC6A2, could be influenced by this feature.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule appears to have potential interactions with several genes involved in neurotransmission and receptor binding (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HRH1) and drug metabolism (CYP2C19, CYP2D6).
