Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COC(=O)N=c1[n-]c2ccc(C(=O)c3cccs3)cc2[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a carboxamide group and a nitroimidazole ring. These structural features are often associated with drugs that interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels.
Step 2: The presence of a nitroimidazole ring suggests potential interaction with GPCRs, particularly those involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways.
Step 3: The benzene ring with a carboxamide group may indicate a compound that could interact with enzymes such as CYP2D6, which metabolizes many drugs including those targeting neurotransmitter systems.
Step 4: Given the structure, the molecule might also interact with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, such as those encoded by genes like PTGS1, which codes for COX-1/COX-2 enzymes.
Step 5: Considering the potential interactions with neurotransmitter systems and signaling pathways, the related genes include DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and SIGMAR1.
