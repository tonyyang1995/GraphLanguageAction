Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [O-]c1ccc(C2C[NH2+]CCc3c2cc([O-])c([O-])c3Cl)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound with a negatively charged oxygen atom and a nitrogen atom bearing a positive charge. It contains a benzene ring with multiple substituents, including a chlorine atom and several oxygen-containing functional groups.
Step 2: Analyzing the structure further, the molecule includes a tricyclic core with a central benzene ring and two additional rings attached, suggesting potential interactions with receptors or enzymes that have similar structural requirements for binding.
Step 3: Considering the genes listed, those involved in receptor activity, particularly G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), are likely to be relevant due to the presence of functional groups that could interact with such receptors. For instance, the tricyclic structure and the presence of nitrogen and oxygen atoms suggest possible interactions with adrenergic and cholinergic receptors.
Step 4: Specific genes that could be related to this molecule include those encoding for adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and cholinergic receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4). Additionally, the molecule's structure might interact with GABA receptors (GABRA1, GABRB1, GABRG1) or dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) given the presence of amine functionalities.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the genes associated with the molecule are: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4. These genes encode receptors that may interact with the molecule due to their specific binding sites and the structural features of the molecule.
