Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCn1cc(C(=O)[O-])c(=O)c2cnc(N3CCCC3)nc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that includes a tricyclic structure, which is characteristic of certain types of ligands for receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and signal transduction pathways. This tricyclic pattern suggests the molecule might interact with receptors or enzymes that play roles in these pathways.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-CO-NH-) and a carboxylate group (-COOH) in the molecule indicates it could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes such as those in the cytochrome P450 family (CYP), which are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics. This structural feature points towards potential interactions with genes encoding CYP enzymes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a nitrile group (-CN), which is often found in compounds that can act as inhibitors of enzymes such as histone deacetylases (HDACs). However, no HDAC-related genes are listed in the provided gene set, so this feature does not directly relate to any of the listed genes.
Step 4: Given the presence of aromatic rings and functional groups that can participate in hydrogen bonding, the molecule may have affinity for receptors involved in neurotransmission. Among the listed genes, several are associated with neurotransmitter receptors, including DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), HTR2A (serotonin receptor 5-HT2A), and CHRM1 (cholinergic receptor muscarinic M1).
Step 5: The overall structure of the molecule, particularly its tricyclic nature and presence of functional groups that can form hydrogen bonds, suggests potential interactions with receptors and enzymes that are involved in signaling pathways. Therefore, the related genes include CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A, and CHRM1.
Summary of Related Genes:
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- DRD2
- HTR2A
- CHRM1 Step 5: The related genes include CYP2C19, CYP2D6, DRD2, HTR2A, and CHRM1. These genes encode enzymes and receptors that are involved in drug metabolism and neurotransmission. The molecule's structure and functional groups suggest it could interact with these proteins, potentially affecting their activity or binding.
