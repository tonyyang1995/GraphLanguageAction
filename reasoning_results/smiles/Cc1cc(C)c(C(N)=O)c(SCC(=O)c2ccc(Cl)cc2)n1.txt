Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc(C)c(C(N)=O)c(SCC(=O)c2ccc(Cl)cc2)n1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a nitro group (-NO2), an amide group (-CONH-), and a thioether group (-S-). These functional groups suggest the molecule has potential for interactions with enzymes involved in metabolism and transport.
Step 2: The presence of a thioether group indicates the molecule could interact with proteins containing cysteine residues, which are common in many receptors and transporters. This is relevant to genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and transporters.
Step 3: The amide group is characteristic of substrates for cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2D6, which is known to metabolize drugs with amide functionalities. This suggests a possible interaction with CYP2D6.
Step 4: The nitro group (-NO2) can also be metabolized by CYP enzymes, specifically CYP1A2 and CYP2E1, indicating another potential interaction with CYP enzymes.
Step 5: Given the structural features of the molecule, it is likely to interact with genes involved in neurotransmitter systems, such as HTR2A, HTR2B, and DRD2, due to their role in serotonin and dopamine signaling pathways.
