Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCS(=O)(=O)c1ccc2c(c1)N(S(C)(=O)=O)CC(C(=O)NCCOC)O2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that contains a benzene ring system, an oxazole ring, and a sulfonamide group. These structural elements suggest that the molecule could interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, particularly those that handle substrates containing these functional groups.
Step 2: Among the listed genes, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are known to be involved in the metabolism of various drugs through the oxidation of aromatic rings and the introduction of oxygen into molecules. The presence of a benzene ring and an oxazole ring in the molecule indicates potential interaction with these cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a sulfonamide group, which is recognized by the enzyme SLC6A2 (solute carrier family 6 member 2), a sodium-dependent neurotransmitter transporter that includes GABA and norepinephrine. This suggests that the molecule might interact with SLC6A2, affecting neurotransmitter reuptake.
Step 4: Given the presence of multiple functional groups and the potential for interaction with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, the molecule may also influence receptors and signaling pathways associated with neurotransmission and hormone regulation. Genes such as HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A) and ESR1 (estrogen receptor alpha) could be affected due to their roles in neurotransmitter and hormone signaling.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, SLC6A2, HTR2A, and ESR1.
