Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(-c2csc(=NC(=O)Cn3nc(C)cc3C)[n-]2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule with multiple functional groups including an amide group (-CONH), a thiophene ring (c2csc), a pyridine ring (c1ccc(-c2csc), and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This structure suggests the molecule could be a drug-like compound with potential biological activity.
Step 2: Analyzing the pattern of the molecule, it includes functional groups that are known to interact with various receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission and metabolism. For instance, the presence of a carboxylic acid and amide group might indicate this molecule could act as a ligand for G-protein coupled receptors or ion channels.
Step 3: Given the potential for interaction with receptors and enzymes, we can hypothesize that this molecule might have an effect on genes involved in neurotransmitter signaling and metabolism pathways. Genes such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C encode for serotonin receptors, which are known to be modulated by various drugs.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule’s structure hints at possible interactions with enzymes like CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which are involved in drug metabolism. These enzymes are encoded by the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 genes respectively.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related genes to this molecule include those involved in neurotransmitter signaling (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C) and drug metabolism (CYP2D6, CYP3A4).
