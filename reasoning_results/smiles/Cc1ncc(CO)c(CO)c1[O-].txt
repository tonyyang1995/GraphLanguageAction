Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1ncc(CO)c(CO)c1[O-], and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings, including a benzene ring and a furan ring, along with various functional groups such as amide (CO), ester (CO), and a nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins that have similar chemical features.
Step 2: The presence of a furan ring and the amide group could indicate the molecule might interact with enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP (cytochrome P450) genes, which are known to metabolize drugs and xenobiotics. Specifically, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are relevant here due to their role in metabolizing compounds with aromatic and amide functionalities.
Step 3: The molecule also contains an ester group (CO) and a carboxylate group ([O-]), which could suggest possible interactions with receptors or transporters that bind to acidic or fatty acid-like molecules. Genes like SLC6A2 (solute carrier family 6 member 2) and SLC6A4 (solute carrier family 6 member 4), which encode neurotransmitter transporters, could be relevant.
Step 4: The nitrogen atom in the heterocyclic ring could potentially form hydrogen bonds or other interactions with proteins that contain histidine residues, such as kinases. For example, LCK (Lck tyrosine kinase) and MCL1 (myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1) may have binding sites for molecules containing basic functionalities.
Step 5: Considering the above structural features, the most likely related genes are those involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6), neurotransmitter transport (SLC6A2, SLC6A4), and kinase activity (LCK, MCL1).
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- SLC6A2
- SLC6A4
- LCK
- MCL1 Step 5: Summary of related gene names:
- MCL1
These genes are likely to be involved in the molecular interactions of the given molecule based on its structural features.
