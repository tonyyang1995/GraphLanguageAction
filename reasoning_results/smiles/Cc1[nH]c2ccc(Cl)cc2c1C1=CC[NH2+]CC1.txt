Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1[nH]c2ccc(Cl)cc2c1C1=CC[NH2+]CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains several functional groups such as a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (N+), an aromatic ring system, and a chlorine atom. The presence of these functional groups suggests that the molecule may interact with proteins involved in signaling pathways or transport mechanisms.
Step 2: The nitrogen atom with a positive charge (N+) indicates that the molecule could be an agonist or modulator for receptors that recognize positively charged amino acids, such as some G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are known to be regulated by various neurotransmitters and hormones.
Step 3: The aromatic ring system in the molecule might contribute to its ability to form hydrogen bonds or π-π stacking interactions with proteins, which are common modes of binding for many small molecules. This structural feature could potentially interact with enzymes or receptors that have similar binding sites.
Step 4: Considering the potential interactions with GPCRs and enzymes, the molecule may be related to genes encoding these types of proteins. Specifically, it could be relevant to genes associated with neurotransmitter receptors and signaling pathways.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, HRH1, LCK, MCL1, OPKR1, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4. These genes encode proteins involved in neurotransmitter receptor function, enzyme activity, and signaling pathways.
