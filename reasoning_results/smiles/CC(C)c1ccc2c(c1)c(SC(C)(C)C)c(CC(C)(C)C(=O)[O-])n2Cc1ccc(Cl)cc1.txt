Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC(C)c1ccc2c(c1)c(SC(C)(C)C)c(CC(C)(C)C(=O)[O-])n2Cc1ccc(Cl)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a complex structure including benzene rings, heteroatoms like sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen, and a carboxyl group (-COOH). This structure suggests it could be a drug-like molecule with potential pharmacological activity.
Step 2: Considering the presence of a carboxyl group and other functional groups, this molecule could potentially interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. These cytochrome P450 enzymes are responsible for metabolizing many drugs.
Step 3: The molecule also has a quaternary ammonium salt (N+), which may make it an agonist or antagonist for certain receptors. For example, it might bind to adrenergic receptors like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, and ADRB2, or to dopaminergic receptors like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
Step 4: Additionally, the presence of a benzene ring and heteroatoms could contribute to interactions with ion channels or transporters. For instance, it might affect KCNH2 (hERG potassium channel) or SLC6A4 (norepinephrine transporter).
Step 5: Based on the above structural analysis, the related genes for this molecule include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, KCNH2, and SLC6A4.
