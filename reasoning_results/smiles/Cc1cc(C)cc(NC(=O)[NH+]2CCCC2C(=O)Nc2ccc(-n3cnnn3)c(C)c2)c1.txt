Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc(C)cc(NC(=O)[NH+]2CCCC2C(=O)Nc2ccc(-n3cnnn3)c(C)c2)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any other information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a carboxamide group (-CONH2) and an amide group (-CO-NH-), which are characteristic of many drugs that interact with receptors and enzymes.
Step 2: The presence of multiple aromatic rings and heteroatoms (such as nitrogen and oxygen) suggests the molecule could act as a ligand for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or ion channels.
Step 3: The molecule's structure includes a pyrrolidine ring, which is often found in molecules that interact with dopamine receptors, such as D2-like receptors.
Step 4: The presence of an acetyl group (-COCH3) and a quinoline moiety may indicate potential interactions with enzymes like CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 5: Given the structural features, the molecule may be related to several genes including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are associated with receptor and enzyme activities.
