Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Nc1cccc(C(=O)[NH+]2CCOCC2)c1)c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any other text.
Step 1: The molecule contains a pyrrolidine ring and a pyridine ring connected through a carbonyl group, which is characteristic of many ligands for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural pattern suggests potential interactions with receptors that have similar binding sites.
Step 2: The presence of an amide group (-CONH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) indicates the molecule could act as a ligand for various GPCRs, particularly those involved in neurotransmission and hormone signaling.
Step 3: Notable GPCRs that may be influenced by this molecule include HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, all of which are involved in serotonin receptor signaling and play roles in mood regulation and neurotransmission.
Step 4: The molecule also has potential to interact with CYP enzymes due to its functional groups, specifically CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are involved in the metabolism of various drugs.
Step 5: Based on the structural features and functional groups present, the related genes are: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Step 5: Summary of related genes: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CYP2C9, CYP2C19.
