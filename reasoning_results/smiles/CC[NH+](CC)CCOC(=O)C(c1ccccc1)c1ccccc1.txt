Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC[NH+](CC)CCOC(=O)C(c1ccccc1)c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups, including an amine group (-NH+) that is positively charged, a phenyl ring (Ph), and an ester group (-COOR). This structure suggests it could be a small molecule ligand that interacts with receptors or enzymes.
Step 2: The positively charged amine group (-NH+) indicates potential interactions with anionic sites on proteins, which might include ion channels, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), or transporters. This feature is particularly relevant for genes encoding such proteins.
Step 3: The presence of a phenyl ring (Ph) and an ester group suggests the molecule could have affinity for enzymes involved in metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP (cytochrome P450) genes, which are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 4: The overall structure also hints at possible interactions with receptors or ion channels, given the presence of aromatic rings and hydrophobic regions, which could align with the structures of GPCRs, ion channels, and other membrane-bound proteins.
Step 5: Based on the molecular features described, the molecule may interact with several genes, including CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, and SLC6A4. These genes encode enzymes involved in drug metabolism and transporters that could mediate the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the molecule.
Related Gene Names:
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- SLC6A4 Step 5: Summary of Related Genes:
The molecule is likely to be related to the genes CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR2A, HTR2B, and SLC6A4. These genes encode enzymes involved in drug metabolism and transporters that could play a role in the molecule's pharmacological activity. Specifically, CYP enzymes are responsible for metabolizing the molecule, while HTR2A and HTR2B encode serotonin receptors that might be targeted by the molecule, and SLC6A4 encodes a transporter that could affect the molecule's absorption or reuptake. Other genes like CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 are also involved in drug metabolism, making them relevant for understanding how this molecule might interact with the body.
