Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc2c3c(c1OC)C1(C=CC(=O)C=C1)CC3[NH+](C(=O)c1ccccc1)CC2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this relationship might be clinically relevant.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is common in many drugs that interact with receptors or enzymes. This structure is present in the molecule and could potentially interact with proteins that have similar structural motifs.
Step 2: The presence of a pyrrolidine ring, specifically in the part of the molecule labeled [NH+], suggests potential interactions with ion channels or receptors that have binding sites for basic amino groups. This pattern is particularly relevant to genes encoding ion channels or receptors such as HRH1 (Histamine H1 receptor), which has a binding site for basic amino groups.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a quinoline ring, which is known to interact with certain enzymes and receptors. This structural feature may indicate potential interactions with genes like CYP2D6, an enzyme involved in drug metabolism, or HTR2A (Serotonin 2A receptor), which binds ligands that contain a quinoline-like structure.
Step 4: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH-) in the molecule suggests it could act as an inhibitor or activator of enzymes or receptors that bind to such functional groups. This feature is particularly relevant to genes like CYP2C19, which metabolizes drugs containing carboxamide groups, and HTR2C, which has binding sites for ligands containing carboxamide moieties.
Step 5: Given the complexity of the molecule and its various functional groups, it is likely to interact with multiple targets. However, based on the identified structural features, the most probable related genes are HRH1, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and HTR2C.
