Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: N=c1[n-]c(=S)[n-]c2c1C1(CCCC1)Cc1ccccc1-2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples.
Step 1: The molecule contains a nitrogen atom with a negative charge, which is part of a nitrile group (-N=C-) and a sulfide group (-S-). These functional groups suggest the molecule may interact with proteins that have binding sites for negatively charged moieties or specific functional groups like nitriles and sulfides.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring (indicated by the C1(CCCC1) part of the SMILES string) and multiple aromatic rings could indicate potential interactions with proteins involved in signaling pathways or metabolic processes, such as those encoded by genes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The long alkyl chain connected to the benzene ring suggests hydrophobic interactions, which might be relevant to proteins involved in lipid transport or signaling, such as those encoded by genes like ABCB1, which encodes a multidrug resistance protein.
Step 4: The cyclic structure (indicated by the [n-]c2c1 parts) and the presence of multiple nitrogen atoms could potentially interact with receptors or ion channels, suggesting possible relationships with genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule may be related to several genes, including ABCB1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6.
Summary of related gene names: ABCB1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
