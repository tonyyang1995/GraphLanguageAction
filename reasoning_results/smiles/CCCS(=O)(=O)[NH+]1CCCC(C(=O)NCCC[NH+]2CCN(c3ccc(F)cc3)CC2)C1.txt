Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCS(=O)(=O)[NH+]1CCCC(C(=O)NCCC[NH+]2CCN(c3ccc(F)cc3)CC2)C1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring, a carbonyl group (C=O), a sulfoxide group (S(=O)(=O)), and an amine group (-NH+). These structural features suggest that the molecule could interact with proteins involved in signaling pathways, transport processes, or enzymatic activities.
Step 2: The presence of a sulfoxide group and a carbonyl group suggests that this molecule might be metabolized by enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are known to catalyze the oxidation of similar functional groups. These cytochrome P450 enzymes are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The amine group (-NH+) indicates that the molecule could act as a ligand for receptors or ion channels. For instance, it might bind to G protein-coupled receptors like DRD2, DRD3, or DRD4, which are associated with neurotransmission, or to ion channels such as KCNH2, which is involved in cardiac electrical activity.
Step 4: Given the presence of aromatic rings and potential hydrogen bonding donors (amine group), the molecule could also interact with membrane proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, such as EGFR, which plays a role in cell growth and differentiation.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the most likely related genes are those involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6), neurotransmission and receptor binding (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, KCNH2), and signal transduction (EGFR).
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- DRD2
- DRD3
- DRD4
- EGFR
- KCNH2
These genes are directly or indirectly related to the molecule's potential biological activities based on its chemical structure.
