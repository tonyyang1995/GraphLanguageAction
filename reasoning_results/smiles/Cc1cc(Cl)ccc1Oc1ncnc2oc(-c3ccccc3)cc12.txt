Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc1ncnc2oc(-c3ccccc3)cc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that includes several functional groups such as aromatic rings, a chloroalkyl group, an oxygen atom, and a cyclic amine. This structure suggests the molecule could be involved in interactions with proteins that bind to or are influenced by these chemical features.
Step 2: Among the provided genes, those encoding for receptors and enzymes that interact with ligands or metabolize drugs are more likely to have a direct relationship with this molecule. For instance, genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are known to bind various ligands including small molecules, are potential candidates.
Step 3: Specific genes like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4 encode for adrenergic and cholinergic receptors, respectively. These receptors typically bind to catecholamines and acetylcholine, which are structurally similar to some small molecules that might interact with the aromatic and chloroalkyl groups present in the molecule.
Step 4: Genes such as CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 encode for cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are involved in the metabolism of many drugs. The presence of functional groups like the chloroalkyl and oxygen atoms in the molecule indicates it could be a substrate for these enzymes, making these genes potentially relevant.
Step 5: Based on the structure and functional groups of the molecule, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.
Summary of related gene names:
- ADRA1D
- ADRA2B
- ADRB2
- CHRM1
- CHRM3
- CHRM4
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
- CYP2D6
