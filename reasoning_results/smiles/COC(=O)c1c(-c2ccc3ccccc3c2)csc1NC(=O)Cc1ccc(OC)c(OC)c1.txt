Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COC(=O)c1c(-c2ccc3ccccc3c2)csc1NC(=O)Cc1ccc(OC)c(OC)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring fused to an oxazole ring (O=C(O)), which is a common pharmacophore motif for drugs targeting G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature suggests potential interactions with GPCRs.
Step 2: The molecule also includes a quinoline moiety (quinoline is a heterocyclic aromatic compound), which can be involved in binding to certain enzymes like cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. CYP enzymes are known to metabolize various drugs, including those that interact with GPCRs.
Step 3: The presence of a carboxamide group (-CONH-) in the molecule indicates it could be an agonist or antagonist of GPCRs, particularly those with a histidine residue in their transmembrane region, such as D2-like dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4).
Step 4: The overall structure of the molecule, with its benzene rings and heterocycles, aligns well with the binding sites of GPCRs, suggesting it may interact with multiple GPCRs, including muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4), serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), and adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2).
Step 5: Given the structural characteristics and potential interactions with GPCRs, the related genes include: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2. These genes encode proteins that are directly targeted by the molecule's structural features. 
Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2, DRD3, DRD4
- CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6
- ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2
These genes encode receptors that the molecule is likely to interact with based on its chemical structure.
