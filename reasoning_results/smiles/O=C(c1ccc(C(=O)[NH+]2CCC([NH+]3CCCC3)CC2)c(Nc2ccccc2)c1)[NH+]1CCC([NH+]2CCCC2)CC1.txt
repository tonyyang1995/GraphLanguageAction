Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(c1ccc(C(=O)[NH+]2CCC([NH+]3CCCC3)CC2)c(Nc2ccccc2)c1)[NH+]1CCC([NH+]2CCCC2)CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure that includes multiple rings, heteroatoms (such as nitrogen and oxygen), and functional groups such as carbonyl (C=O), amide (N-C=O), and ester (C-O-C). The presence of these functional groups suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in enzymatic reactions or receptors.
Step 2: The molecule contains several aromatic rings, particularly benzene rings, which are known to interact with various receptor proteins and enzymes. Notably, the presence of an amide group could indicate a potential interaction with enzymes that contain amine-binding sites, such as those encoded by genes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: Additionally, the molecule's structure includes a pyrrolidine ring and other heterocycles, which can form hydrogen bonds and other non-covalent interactions with amino acid residues in protein binding sites. This feature may be relevant for genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4, as well as serotonergic receptors like HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C.
Step 4: The presence of a nitrophenyl group and other electron-withdrawing groups might also suggest a potential interaction with ion channels, such as KCNH2, which encodes a potassium channel, and SIGMAR1, which encodes a sigma receptor.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmission, and ion channel function. The related gene names include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, KCNH2, and SIGMAR1.
