Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC1CSc2nc3sc4c(c3c(=O)n21)CCCC4, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound, specifically a benzodiazepine derivative, which contains multiple rings and functional groups such as amide (N=C), ester (O=C-O), and aromatic rings (C6). This structure is characteristic of drugs that interact with receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmitter systems.
Step 2: Benzodiazepines are known to interact with the GABAA receptor, which is composed of various subunits encoded by different genes. The GABAA receptor plays a crucial role in the modulation of inhibitory neurotransmission, and its interaction with benzodiazepines can lead to anxiolytic, sedative, and anticonvulsant effects.
Step 3: The presence of the ester group (-COO-) in the molecule suggests potential metabolism through cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are known to metabolize many drugs including benzodiazepines. These enzymes are encoded by the CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 genes, respectively.
Step 4: The amide group (-CONH-) in the molecule indicates it may be an agonist or antagonist for certain receptors, possibly including those involved in the dopaminergic system, such as D2-like receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4). These receptors are encoded by the corresponding genes and are involved in the regulation of mood, reward, and motor control.
Step 5: Given the structure and function of the molecule, the related genes include those encoding for GABAA receptor subunits (e.g., GABRA1, GABRB1, GABRC), CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and D2-like dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4).
Summary of related gene names:
- GABRA1
- GABRB1
- GABRC
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- DRD2
- DRD3
- DRD4 Step 5: Summary of related gene names:
- DRD4
These genes are directly or indirectly related to the molecular structure and function described in the molecule.
