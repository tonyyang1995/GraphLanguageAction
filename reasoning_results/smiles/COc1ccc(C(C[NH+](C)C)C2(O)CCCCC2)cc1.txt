Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a complex structure including aromatic rings, a nitrogen atom with a positive charge, and various functional groups such as amide and ester bonds. This structure suggests the molecule could be involved in interactions with proteins that have binding sites for similar chemical features.
Step 2: The presence of a positively charged nitrogen atom (N+) indicates potential interaction with negatively charged sites on protein surfaces, which could be relevant for proteins like ion channels or receptors.
Step 3: The molecule's structure includes multiple hydrophobic regions due to its long alkyl chains and aromatic rings, suggesting it might interact with hydrophobic pockets of proteins, particularly those involved in cell signaling pathways.
Step 4: Considering the pattern of the molecule and the types of interactions it could form, the related genes are likely to be those encoding for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), ion channels, and enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HRH1, LCK, MCL1, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, and possibly others depending on the exact mechanism of action of the molecule.
