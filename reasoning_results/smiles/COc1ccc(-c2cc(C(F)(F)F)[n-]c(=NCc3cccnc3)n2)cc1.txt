Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(-c2cc(C(F)(F)F)[n-]c(=NCc3cccnc3)n2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound, specifically a benzodiazepine derivative. It contains several functional groups such as an amide (CO), a benzene ring, and various substituents including fluorines, a nitrile group (-N=C), and a pyrrolidine ring.
Step 2: The molecular structure includes a central benzene ring that is substituted with multiple functional groups, including a nitrile group which is likely to be involved in forming hydrogen bonds or acting as a nucleophile in reactions. This nitrile group could interact with amino acid residues in proteins that have acidic side chains.
Step 3: The presence of the nitrile group and the overall structure of the molecule suggest potential interactions with receptors or enzymes that contain specific amino acid sequences or active sites. For example, the nitrile group might interact with histidine residues through hydrogen bonding, which are common in receptor binding sites.
Step 4: Considering the structure and potential interactions, the molecule may be related to receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmission, such as GABA-A receptors, which contain histidine residues that can form hydrogen bonds with ligands. Given this, the molecule could potentially interact with genes encoding for neurotransmitter receptors and enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways.
Step 5: Based on the analysis, the molecule is most likely related to the following genes:
- CNR1 (endocannabinoid receptor 1)
- HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6 (serotonin receptors)
- DRD2, DRD3, DRD4 (dopamine receptors)
- CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4 (muscarinic acetylcholine receptors)
These genes encode proteins that are involved in neurotransmission and could potentially interact with the given molecule due to its structural features.
