Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(Cn1nnc2ccccc21)[NH+]1CCCCC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule with a central part that includes a benzene ring system with a cyano group (-CN) attached to it. The benzene ring is further substituted with various alkyl chains and a nitrogen atom bearing a positive charge. This molecular structure suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in neurotransmitter transport and metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a positively charged nitrogen atom indicates that the molecule could interact with receptors that have binding sites for positively charged groups, such as certain G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: Among the listed genes, several are known to encode for GPCRs, including HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4. These receptors are involved in the modulation of neurotransmission and can be affected by molecules with basic functional groups like the positively charged nitrogen in our molecule.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's aromatic structure and the presence of functional groups like the cyano group could interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are listed among the provided genes.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These genes are involved in neurotransmitter signaling and drug metabolism, respectively.
