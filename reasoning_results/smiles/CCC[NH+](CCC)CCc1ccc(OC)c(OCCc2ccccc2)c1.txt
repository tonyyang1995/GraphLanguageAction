Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCC[NH+](CCC)CCc1ccc(OC)c(OCCc2ccccc2)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide an explanation for why this might be clinically relevant.
Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure with multiple benzene rings and a nitrogen atom that is positively charged (N+). This indicates the molecule could potentially interact with proteins that have binding sites for aromatic compounds or positively charged groups.
Step 2: The presence of a hydroxyl group (-OH) and an ester (-OCC) suggests the molecule may have hydrophilic and lipophilic properties, which could influence its interaction with membrane-bound receptors or enzymes.
Step 3: The molecule contains a cyclic amide (N-C=O) and a phenolic oxygen, which are common functional groups in ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as adrenergic and cholinergic receptors. This structural feature might allow the molecule to bind to and modulate the activity of these types of receptors.
Step 4: The molecule also includes a pyridine ring, which is known to interact with certain drug targets, including enzymes involved in drug metabolism like cytochrome P450s (CYP enzymes).
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and functional groups present, the molecule is likely to interact with several genes encoding receptors and enzymes, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, PTGS1, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4.
