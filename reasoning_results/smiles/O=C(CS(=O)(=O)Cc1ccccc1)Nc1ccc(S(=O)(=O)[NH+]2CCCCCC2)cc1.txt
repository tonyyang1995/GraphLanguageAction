Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(CS(=O)(=O)Cc1ccccc1)Nc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)[NH+]2CCCCCC2)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that includes multiple functional groups such as carbonyls, sulfoxides, and amides. The presence of these functional groups suggests the molecule likely interacts with proteins that have binding sites for similar chemical moieties.
Step 2: The molecule contains a thioether group (CS(=O)(=O)) which is characteristic of thiophosphates or other sulfur-containing compounds. This type of functional group could potentially interact with enzymes or receptors that have cysteine residues, which are common in protein targets like kinases or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 3: The molecule also has an amide group (Nc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)[NH+]2CCCCCC2)cc1), which is often involved in hydrogen bonding and can be recognized by proteins that have amino acid side chains capable of forming hydrogen bonds, such as serines, threonines, or aspartates.
Step 4: Given the complexity and the presence of these functional groups, the molecule may interact with several genes listed, particularly those encoding for enzymes (like CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and receptors (like DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HRH1). These genes encode proteins that have binding sites for molecules with similar functional groups.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related genes include: CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HRH1.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- CYP3A4
- DRD2
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HRH1 Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the related genes include: CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR2A, HTR2B, HRH1. These genes are involved in various physiological processes including metabolism and neurotransmission, which aligns with the molecular structure of the compound.
