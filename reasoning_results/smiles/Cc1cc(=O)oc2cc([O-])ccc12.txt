Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc(=O)oc2cc([O-])ccc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a molecule that is likely a derivative of a benzodiazepine or a similar class of compounds. The core structure consists of a six-membered ring (c1cc(=O)oc2) which is characteristic of this class. Benzodiazepines are known for their ability to modulate neurotransmitter receptors, particularly GABA receptors.
Step 2: The molecule also contains an aromatic ring (c2cc([O-])ccc12), which suggests it might interact with receptors that have a binding site for ligands containing an aromatic group. This is relevant because many neurotransmitter receptors, such as GABAA receptors, have sites that preferentially bind aromatic ligands.
Step 3: Given the presence of a carboxylate group (-O-) and an oxygen atom double-bonded to carbon (c(=O)), this molecule likely has acidic properties and could be a ligand for receptors that respond to acidic or charged ligands. This feature is significant for molecules that interact with ion channels or receptors that are sensitive to pH changes, like the GABAA receptor.
Step 4: The interaction of this molecule with GABAA receptors would be relevant to genes encoding subunits of these receptors, such as those listed under the neurotransmitter receptor category (e.g., GABRA1, GABRB1, GABRG1). However, since the specific subunits are not mentioned, we focus on the broader category of genes involved in signal transduction pathways that are influenced by GABAergic signaling.
Step 5: Considering the pattern and properties of the molecule, it is most likely to be related to genes involved in GABAergic signaling pathways. These include genes such as GABRA1, GABRB1, GABRG1, HTR1A (which encodes a serotonin receptor but can also interact with GABA), and other genes involved in receptor signaling and modulation.
Summary of Related Gene Names:
- GABRA1
- GABRB1
- GABRG1
- HTR1A
- Other genes involved in GABAergic signaling and receptor modulation Step 5: Summary of Related Gene Names:
- Other genes involved in GABAergic signaling and receptor modulation
These genes are directly or indirectly related to the molecule due to its potential to interact with GABA receptors and influence GABAergic signaling pathways. The exact subset of genes may vary based on the specific function and binding affinity of the molecule.
