Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc(=O)n(-c2ccccc2)n1C, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule is a cyclic amide (indole) derivative containing a pyrrolidine ring and a phenyl group. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 2: The presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH) and a ketone (-CO) group could indicate potential activity towards enzymes like CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, which are involved in the metabolism of drugs containing these functional groups.
Step 3: The cyclic structure and the presence of nitrogen atoms may suggest binding affinity for receptors such as HTR2A and HTR2C, which are G-protein coupled receptors that interact with serotonin.
Step 4: The overall structure does not show clear patterns indicative of direct interaction with other listed genes such as ABCB1, ABL1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CA12, CA2, CA9, CACNA1H, CDK2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CNR1, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, ESR1, FLT1, HRH1, KDR, LCK, MCL1, OPRK1, PPARG, PTGS1, SIGMAR1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4, and KCNH2.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and HTR2A, HTR2C. 
Summary of related gene names: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, HTR2A, HTR2C. Step 1: The molecule is a cyclic amide (indole) derivative containing a pyrrolidine ring and a phenyl group. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and HTR2A, H
