Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cccc(-n2c(=O)c3c(n4cnnc24)-c2ccccc2CC32CCCCC2)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring with multiple substituents, including a pyrrole ring and a nitrile group. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C19 and CYP2D6.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrile group (-CN) could indicate activity against certain G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are often targeted by drugs. This may relate to genes like DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which encode dopamine receptors.
Step 3: The cyclic amine structure in the molecule might interact with ion channels, potentially linking it to KCNH2, which encodes a potassium channel.
Step 4: The overall aromatic and polar nature of the molecule could suggest potential binding to nuclear receptors like PPARG, which is involved in lipid metabolism and adipogenesis.
Step 5: Given the complexity and specific functional groups, the molecule might also interact with EGFR, a receptor tyrosine kinase, depending on its exact structure.
