Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(Cl)c(N2CC[NH+](CCCNC(=O)Nc3ccc(C)cc3)CC2)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a complex structure including a benzene ring system, a pyrrole ring, and several heteroatoms such as nitrogen and chlorine. These structural elements suggest potential interactions with enzymes and receptors that have similar chemical features.
Step 2: Among the listed genes, those involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and neurotransmitter systems (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) are particularly relevant due to their known roles in binding to small molecules and metabolizing drugs.
Step 3: The presence of a pyrrole ring and multiple heteroatoms, especially nitrogen and chlorine, aligns well with the substrate specificity of cytochrome P450 enzymes like CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which are known to metabolize drugs containing aromatic rings and heteroatoms.
Step 4: The molecule’s structure also suggests it could interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as D2-like dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) and serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), given the common pattern of ligand binding sites for these receptors often include aromatic rings and polar functional groups.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis and the known functions of the listed genes, the molecule is likely to be related to the genes involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and neurotransmitter signaling pathways (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6).

These structural elements suggest potential interactions with enzymes and receptors that have similar chemical features.
Step 2: The presence of a benzene ring and heteroatoms like nitrogen and chlorine indicates possible interactions with enzymes like cytochromes P450 (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are involved in drug metabolism.
Step 3: The molecule's structure may also allow it to bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) and serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2
