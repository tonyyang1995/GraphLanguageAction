Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCN(CCCNC(=O)C1CC[NH+](S(=O)(=O)CC)CC1)c1cccc(C)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule has a complex structure containing several functional groups such as amine, carbonyl, and aromatic rings. These functional groups are common in drugs that interact with receptors or enzymes. Notably, the molecule contains an amide group (-CONH-) which is often found in ligands for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 2: Given the presence of a quinoline-like ring system and an amide functionality, this molecule could potentially interact with GPCRs. GPCRs are known to be associated with various neurotransmitters and hormones, which explains the presence of multiple receptor-related genes in the list.
Step 3: The molecule also includes a sulfonamide group, which is characteristic of compounds that can inhibit enzymes like CYP2C19 and CYP2C9, involved in drug metabolism. This suggests that the molecule might have pharmacokinetic properties relevant to these enzymes.
Step 4: Considering the overall structure and functional groups, the molecule could plausibly interact with receptors such as DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, and HTR2C, which are involved in serotonin signaling pathways. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that modulates mood, appetite, and sleep, among other functions.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis and the potential interactions with receptors and enzymes, the related genes include those encoding GPCRs and enzymes involved in drug metabolism. Specifically, the related gene names are: DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, CYP2C19, and CYP2C9.
Summary of related gene names:
- DRD2
- DRD3
- DRD4
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- CYP2C19
- CYP2C9
These genes are directly or indirectly related to the molecule's potential pharmacological activity. Other genes listed may not have a direct relationship based on the current structural information. Further testing would be needed to confirm the interaction between the molecule and these genes.
