Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CN=c1[n-]n2c(N(C)C)cc(C)nc2c1S(=O)(=O)c1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a complex structure with several functional groups including a cyano group (CN), a nitro group (-N=), an amide group (CON), a thioester group (S=O), and aromatic rings. These features suggest that the molecule may interact with proteins involved in signal transduction, transport, and metabolism.
Step 2: Looking at the genes provided, several are associated with neurotransmitter receptors and enzymes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism. For example, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6 are serotonin receptors, which are known to bind small molecules and modulate their activity. Similarly, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are members of the cytochrome P450 family, which metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: The presence of a nitro group (-N=) and a thioester group (S=O) suggests that the molecule might be an inhibitor or substrate for enzymes like CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. These enzymes are known to oxidize aromatic compounds, which could be relevant to the aromatic rings present in the molecule.
Step 4: The aromatic rings and potential hydrogen bonding sites (e.g., the amide group) indicate that the molecule could interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4, which are involved in dopamine signaling. Additionally, the presence of a thioester group could be relevant to the activation of prodrugs or the binding to certain receptor sites.
Step 5: Given the above structural features and the known functions of the listed genes, the molecule is most likely related to the following genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
Summary of Related Genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4.
