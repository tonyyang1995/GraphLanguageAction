Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C=CC(=O)[NH+](C)CCOc1c(-c2cc(F)cc(NC(=O)c3ccc(C4CC4)cc3F)c2C)[n-]cnc1=N, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system with an amide group (C=CC(=O)), which is common in ligands for receptors such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This structural feature may interact with genes involved in receptor signaling.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom with positive charge ([NH+]) suggests potential interaction with proteins that bind or modify amino groups, like enzymes or receptors.
Step 3: The molecule includes a substituted phenyl ring with fluorine atoms (F), which could be recognized by proteins involved in drug metabolism or transport, such as CYP enzymes or ABC transporters.
Step 4: The presence of a pyrrole ring (c1c(-c2cc(F)cc(NC(=O)c3ccc(C4CC4)cc3F)c2C)) and other heterocycles might interact with enzymes like CYPs or receptors that bind to specific functional groups.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and its potential interactions, the related genes include: ABCB1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and SLC6A4.
Related genes: ABCB1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, SLC6A4.
