Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=c1cc(-c2ccc([O-])c([O-])c2)oc2cc([O-])cc([O-])c12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that contains several functional groups such as an oxygen-containing heterocycle, a carbonyl group, and multiple aromatic rings. The presence of these functional groups suggests the molecule may interact with proteins that bind to or are influenced by similar chemical structures.
Step 2: One of the key functional groups in the molecule is the carboxylate group (-COOH), which is often found in molecules that interact with receptors or enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways. This pattern is particularly relevant for genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes involved in signal transduction.
Step 3: The molecule also contains a quinone-like structure, which might be recognized by enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP genes. The presence of this structure could indicate potential interactions with CYP enzymes like CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 4: Given the complex structure and the presence of multiple polar functional groups, the molecule could potentially interact with ion channels or transporters. Genes such as KCNH2 (encoding the hERG potassium channel) and SLC6A4 (encoding a serotonin transporter) could be involved in these interactions due to their roles in ion transport and neurotransmitter reuptake.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and the identified functional groups, the most likely related genes include: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, KCNH2, and SLC6A4.
