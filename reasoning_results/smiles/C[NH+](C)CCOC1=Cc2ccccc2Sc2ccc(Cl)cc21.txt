Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+](C)CCOC1=Cc2ccccc2Sc2ccc(Cl)cc21, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule is a complex organic compound with multiple functional groups including an amine group (NH+), a phenyl ring, and a hydroxyl group (OH). These functional groups suggest that the molecule could interact with proteins involved in neurotransmission and receptor binding.
Step 2: The presence of the amine group (NH+) indicates potential interactions with receptors that have amine-binding sites, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This functional group is particularly relevant to adrenergic receptors (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4).
Step 3: The phenyl ring and hydroxyl group may also interact with enzymes involved in drug metabolism. For example, the molecule could be metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4), which are known to metabolize many drugs.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule might influence signaling pathways involving GPCRs, which are often linked to various diseases and can be modulated by drugs. Receptors like D2 dopamine receptor (DRD2), serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6), and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4) are key players in these pathways.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is most likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, and CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4. These genes encode proteins that could directly or indirectly interact with the molecule due to their roles in neurotransmission, receptor binding, and drug metabolism.
