Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C=CC(=O)Nc1ccc2[n-]cnc(=Nc3cccc(Br)c3)c2c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound that includes a benzene ring, an amide group (-CONH), and a nitrogen atom with a negative charge. This structure suggests potential interactions with receptors or enzymes that bind to similar functional groups.
Step 2: Analyzing the pattern of the molecule, we see that it contains a benzene ring which is common in many drugs and can interact with proteins such as receptors and transporters. The presence of a nitrogen atom with a negative charge could indicate a potential interaction with ion channels or other charged protein structures.
Step 3: Considering the specific genes provided, those involved in neurotransmitter systems and signaling pathways might be relevant due to the presence of the amide group and nitrogen atom. For instance, HTR (serotonin receptor) family members are known to bind ligands with similar functional groups.
Step 4: Among the listed genes, several are directly involved in neurotransmitter systems and signaling, including HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which are serotonin receptors. These genes encode proteins that interact with various ligands, some of which have similar chemical structures to the given molecule.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule’s structure might also be relevant to CYP2D6, a cytochrome P450 enzyme that metabolizes many drugs, including those with amide and aromatic components.
Summary of Related Genes:
- HTR1A
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- HTR6
- CYP2D6
These genes are likely to have a direct or indirect relationship with the given molecule based on their involvement in neurotransmission and drug metabolism. Other genes listed may not have a direct relationship but could still interact with the molecule through different biological processes.
