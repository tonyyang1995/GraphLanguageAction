Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(CCC[NH+]1CCN(c2ccccn2)CC1)c1ccc(F)cc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The molecule has a central carbon chain with a carbonyl group (O=C), which indicates it could be a derivative of an organic acid or a ketone. This functional group is often involved in binding to proteins that play roles in cellular signaling pathways, particularly those related to neurotransmission and hormone receptors.
Step 2: Attached to this central chain are various substituents such as alkyl groups, phenyl rings, and a trifluoromethyl group (F). These substituents can modulate the molecule's interaction with different proteins, potentially affecting its ability to bind to receptors or enzymes.
Step 3: The presence of a nitrogen atom with a positive charge (NH+) suggests the molecule may act as a ligand for ion channels or receptors that have positively charged binding sites. Such molecules can interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are often involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release and hormonal responses.
Step 4: The aromatic ring systems, particularly the phenyl groups and the cyclic amine structure, indicate the molecule might have affinity for receptors that contain hydrophobic binding pockets, such as certain GPCRs or ion channels. These structures are common in molecules that interact with neurotransmitter receptors.
Step 5: Given the structural features and potential interactions described, the molecule is most likely to be related to genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and enzymes involved in signal transduction. Specifically, it may interact with genes like DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), HTR1A (Serotonin receptor 1A), HTR2A (Serotonin receptor 2A), and others listed that encode receptors for neurotransmitters and hormones.
