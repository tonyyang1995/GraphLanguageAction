Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(NCC[NH+]1CC[NH+](C(=O)C(c2ccccc2)c2ccccc2)CC1)C(=O)Nc1ccccc1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule is a complex organic compound containing a benzene ring system, amide bonds, and several nitrogen-containing functional groups. This structure suggests potential interactions with enzymes and receptors that have similar functional groups.
Step 2: Looking at the genes provided, those involved in drug metabolism and receptor signaling are likely to interact with this molecule. Genes such as CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 encode enzymes that are involved in the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics. These enzymes could potentially metabolize the given molecule.
Step 3: The molecule also contains amine groups, which might interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Genes like DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2), DRD3 (Dopamine receptor D3), DRD4 (Dopamine receptor D4), HTR1A (Serotonin receptor 1A), HTR2A (Serotonin receptor 2A), HTR2B (Serotonin receptor 2B), and HTR2C (Serotonin receptor 2C) encode receptors that bind to various neurotransmitters and could be affected by the presence of the molecule.
Step 4: The presence of a benzene ring system and amide bonds also indicates potential interactions with ion channels and transporters. For instance, genes such as KCNH2 (Potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2) and SLC6A4 (Solute carrier family 6 member 4) encode proteins that function in ion transport and neurotransmitter reuptake, respectively.
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis and the types of functional groups present, the molecule is most likely to be related to the genes involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and GPCR signaling pathways (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C).
