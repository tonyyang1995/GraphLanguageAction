Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: OC(CC[NH+]1CCCCC1)(c1ccccc1)C1CC2C=CC1C2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not provide any additional information.
Step 1: The molecule contains a benzene ring system, which is common in many drug molecules that interact with receptors and enzymes. This structural feature may suggest potential interactions with genes involved in receptor function or enzyme activity.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule indicates it could be an amine or amide, which are often ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). This suggests possible interaction with genes encoding GPCRs such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRM4.
Step 3: The molecule also has a phenolic hydroxyl group (-OH), which might indicate potential interactions with genes involved in metabolism or signaling pathways, such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and PTGS1.
Step 4: Given the complexity of the molecule and its potential to act as a ligand for various receptors, it is likely to have interactions with multiple genes, including those involved in neurotransmitter systems like DRD2, DRD3, and HTR2A.
Step 5: Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, PTGS1, DRD2, DRD3, HTR2A. Step 5: Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, PTGS1, DRD2, DRD3, HTR2A.
