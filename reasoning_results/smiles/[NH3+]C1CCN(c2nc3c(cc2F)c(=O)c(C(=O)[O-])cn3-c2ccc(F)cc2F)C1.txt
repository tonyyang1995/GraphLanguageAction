Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: [NH3+]C1CCN(c2nc3c(cc2F)c(=O)c(C(=O)[O-])cn3-c2ccc(F)cc2F)C1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that includes an amine group (-NH3+) and a benzene ring. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in neurotransmission and receptor binding.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a quinolone-like structure could indicate the molecule might interact with enzymes involved in metabolism or receptors that bind ligands containing acidic functional groups.
Step 3: The molecule contains fluorine atoms, which are often found in ligands that target specific receptors or enzymes, such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels.
Step 4: Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, this molecule could potentially interact with several genes involved in neurotransmitter signaling pathways, including those encoding receptors for various neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine.
Step 5: Based on the described structural features, the following genes may be related to the molecule: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ABL1, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and CYP2D6.
