Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC1(C)NC(=O)[NH+](c2ccc([N+](=O)[O-])c(C(F)(F)F)c2)C1=O, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a molecule that includes a benzene ring, an amide group, and a quaternary ammonium group. The presence of a benzene ring and an amide group suggests this molecule could be a drug-like compound, potentially interacting with proteins that bind to such structures.
Step 2: The quaternary ammonium group in the molecule, indicated by [NH+], suggests it may act as a positively charged moiety which can interact with negatively charged sites on proteins. This feature is particularly relevant for molecules targeting receptors or ion channels that have binding sites for positively charged groups.
Step 3: Among the listed genes, several are known to encode receptors or ion channels that could interact with the positively charged quaternary ammonium group in the molecule. These include ADRA1D (adrenergic receptor alpha 1D), ADRA2B (adrenergic receptor alpha 2B), ADRB2 (adrenergic receptor beta 2), CHRM1 (cholinergic receptor muscarinic M1), CHRM3 (cholinergic receptor muscarinic M3), CHRM4 (cholinergic receptor muscarinic M4), HRH1 (histamine H1 receptor), HTR1A (serotonin receptor 1A), HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A), HTR2B (serotonin receptor 2B), HTR2C (serotonin receptor 2C), and HTR6 (serotonin receptor 6).
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule’s structure might also interact with ion channels encoded by genes like KCNH2 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2) and LCK (tyrosine-protein kinase Lck), which could be influenced by the presence of a quaternary ammonium group.
Step 5: Summarizing the related gene names, the molecule is likely to be related to the following genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HRH1, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, and LCK. These genes encode proteins that may directly interact with or be affected by the positively charged quaternary ammonium group and other functional groups present in the molecule.
