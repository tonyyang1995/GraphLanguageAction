Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C(N=c1[n-]nc(Cc2ccccc2)s1)c1cccs1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule that includes a nitrile (-CN) group, a cyano group (-C#N), and multiple aromatic rings, likely indicating a compound with potential biological activity.
Step 2: The molecule's structure suggests it could be an inhibitor or modulator of certain enzymes or receptors due to its functional groups and aromatic nature. Notably, it contains a cyano group which can form hydrogen bonds and π-π stacking interactions, both of which are important for binding to protein targets.
Step 3: Given the presence of multiple functional groups and the complexity of the molecule, it is plausible that this compound could interact with several genes whose products are involved in signal transduction pathways, drug metabolism, and neurotransmission. For example, it might affect G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or enzymes like cytochrome P450s (CYPs).
Step 4: Considering the potential for interaction with enzymes and receptors, the following genes are likely to be directly or indirectly affected by this molecule: CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, ESR1, PTGS1, SLC6A2, SLC6A4. These genes encode proteins involved in drug metabolism, neurotransmission, and hormone signaling.
Step 5: Additionally, the molecule might have indirect effects through other genes such as ABL1, ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, and HRH1, which are involved in various signaling pathways including stress response, inflammation, and cell proliferation. However, the direct impact on these genes would depend on the specific mechanism of action of the molecule.
