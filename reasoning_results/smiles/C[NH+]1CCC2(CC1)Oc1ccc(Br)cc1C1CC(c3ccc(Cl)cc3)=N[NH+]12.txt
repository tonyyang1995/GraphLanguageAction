Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: C[NH+]1CCC2(CC1)Oc1ccc(Br)cc1C1CC(c3ccc(Cl)cc3)=N[NH+]12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains several functional groups including amine (NH2), aromatic rings (indicated by benzene rings), and a bromine atom. These features suggest the molecule could be an inhibitor or modulator of enzymes or receptors that interact with these structural elements.
Step 2: Looking at the genes provided, many are involved in various physiological processes such as signal transduction, neurotransmission, and drug metabolism. However, certain genes like CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 are directly involved in the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics, which could potentially interact with the aromatic rings and other functional groups present in the molecule.
Step 3: The presence of a bromine atom and the overall structure of the molecule might also suggest potential interactions with ion channels or receptors that have specific binding sites for halogenated compounds. Genes like KCNH2 (a potassium channel) and HTR2A (serotonin receptor) could be relevant here due to their known sensitivity to halogenated ligands.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's amine group could interact with receptors that bind amines, such as the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4). These receptors play crucial roles in neuromuscular transmission and autonomic function.
Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule could be related to the following genes: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, KCNH2, HTR2A, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2D6
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP3A4
- KCNH2
- HTR2A
- CHRM1
- CHRM3
- CHRM4 Step 5: Based on the above analysis, the molecule could be related to the following genes: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, KCNH2, HTR2A, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4. Summary of related gene names: - CYP2D6 - CYP2C9 - CYP2C19 - CYP3A4 - KCNH2 - HTR2A - CHRM1 - CHRM3 - CHRM4
Note: The remaining genes listed do not have a clear direct relationship based on the molecule's structure and properties described. Therefore, they are not included in the final list of related genes.
