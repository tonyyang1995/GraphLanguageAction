Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CC[NH+](CC)CCCCN=c1nc2[n-]c(=NC(=O)NC(C)(C)C)c(-c3cc(OC)cc(OC)c3)cc2c[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided molecule has a complex structure that includes amine groups, carboxylate groups, and aromatic rings. The presence of an amine group and a carboxylate group suggests it could be an organic acid or a derivative thereof, which might interact with receptors or transporters that are involved in neurotransmission or drug metabolism.
Step 2: The aromatic rings present in the molecule (e.g., in the nitroimidazole and pyrrole structures) are common in drugs that act as agonists or antagonists for various receptors. For instance, these types of functional groups are often found in ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are targeted by several of the listed genes such as HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4.
Step 3: The presence of a nitro group (-NO2) and a guanidine group (-CONH2) in the molecule indicates potential activity as a nitric oxide donor or a modulator of ion channels, respectively. These functionalities could relate to genes like KCNH2, which codes for a voltage-gated potassium channel, and HRH1, which encodes a histamine receptor.
Step 4: Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, this molecule likely interacts with enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as those encoded by CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are known to metabolize a wide range of drugs.
Step 5: Considering the neurotransmitter-related and metabolic enzyme-related aspects of the molecule, the following genes are potentially related: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, KCNH2, HRH1, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. These genes encode proteins that are either directly involved in neurotransmission or are responsible for the metabolism of the molecule.
