Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COC(=O)N=c1[n-]c2ccc(C(=O)c3ccccc3)cc2[n-]1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The provided SMILES string represents a molecule that contains a benzene ring system, an amide group, and a nitrogen atom bearing a negative charge. This structural pattern suggests the molecule could interact with proteins that have similar chemical functionalities or binding sites.
Step 2: Analyzing the potential interactions, the benzene ring system and the amide group are common features in many ligands that bind to receptors and enzymes. These functional groups can form hydrogen bonds and π-π stacking interactions, which are important for protein-ligand binding.
Step 3: Considering the negative charge on the nitrogen, this feature indicates basicity, which might allow the molecule to interact with acidic residues in proteins, such as those found in ion channels or transporters. This could be relevant for genes encoding proteins involved in neurotransmitter transport or receptor signaling.
Step 4: Given the above considerations, the molecule may interact with proteins encoded by genes such as SLC6A2 (Serotonin Transporter), SLC6A4 (Norepinephrine Transporter), and HTR2A (Serotonin Receptor 2A), which are known to have binding sites that include aromatic rings, amides, and charged residues.
Step 5: Based on the molecule’s structure and its potential interaction points, the related genes are: SLC6A2, SLC6A4, and HTR2A. These genes encode proteins that are likely targets for the described molecular interactions. 
Summary of Related Genes:
- SLC6A2
- SLC6A4
- HTR2A
These genes encode proteins that are involved in neurotransmitter transport and serotonin receptor signaling, which aligns with the chemical structure and potential binding properties of the given molecule.
