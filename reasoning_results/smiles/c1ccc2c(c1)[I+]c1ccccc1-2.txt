Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: c1ccc2c(c1)[I+]c1ccccc1-2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Do not generate any examples or extra instructions.
Step 1: The molecule has an iodine atom (I+) attached to a benzene ring, which is part of a larger polycyclic aromatic system. This structure suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in signal transduction and receptor binding.
Step 2: The presence of multiple benzene rings and heteroatoms like nitrogen and oxygen indicates that the molecule could interact with various receptors, particularly those containing hydrophobic binding pockets or positively charged sites.
Step 3: The molecule's aromatic nature and potential for hydrogen bonding could make it relevant to genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other membrane-bound receptors.
Step 4: Considering the molecular features, the molecule might have affinity for genes such as ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6, which encode GPCRs involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways.
Step 5: Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6. These genes are primarily involved in neurotransmitter signaling and receptor function. 
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
