Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=C([O-])c1ccccc1Nc1cccc(C(F)(F)F)c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex molecule containing an aromatic ring system, a cyano group (-CN), and several functional groups such as a carbonyl (C=O), an amide (-CONH-), and a carboxylate (-COO-). This structure suggests that the molecule could be involved in interactions with proteins that have binding sites for aromatic compounds, functional groups, or specific functional motifs.
Step 2: The presence of a carboxylate group (-COO-) indicates that this molecule might interact with proteins containing carboxylic acid binding sites. Genes encoding such proteins include CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, which are involved in the metabolism of various drugs and xenobiotics.
Step 3: The cyano group (-CN) is also a common functional group in drug-like molecules that can form hydrogen bonds and participate in π-π stacking interactions. Proteins with such binding sites include those encoded by genes like PTGS1, which encodes COX-1, an enzyme involved in prostaglandin synthesis.
Step 4: The aromatic ring system in the molecule suggests potential interactions with proteins that bind aromatic compounds, such as those encoded by the CYP family of enzymes (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6).
Step 5: Given the above structural features, the molecule may be related to the following genes: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, PTGS1. These genes encode enzymes that are involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics and drugs, making them relevant to the interaction of the described molecule with biological systems. 
Summary of related gene names: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, PTGS1.
