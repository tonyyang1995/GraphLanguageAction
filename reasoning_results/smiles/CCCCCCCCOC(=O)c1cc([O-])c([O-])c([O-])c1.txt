Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: CCCCCCCCOC(=O)c1cc([O-])c([O-])c([O-])c1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule with a long alkyl chain (CCCCCCCC) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) attached to it. Additionally, there are four negatively charged oxygen atoms (-O-) connected to a benzene ring (c1cc([O-])c([O-])c([O-])c1). This structure suggests that the molecule could be a type of fatty acid or a derivative thereof, possibly with some functional groups that can interact with biological targets.
Step 2: The negatively charged oxygen atoms in the molecule indicate that it could act as an anion or have strong electrostatic interactions with positively charged sites on proteins. This feature might allow the molecule to bind to ion channels or receptors that have positively charged residues in their binding pockets.
Step 3: Among the provided genes, several are involved in neurotransmitter systems and ion channel regulation, which could potentially interact with the described molecular structure. For example, HTR1A (serotonin receptor 1A), HTR2A (serotonin receptor 2A), HTR2B (serotonin receptor 2B), HTR2C (serotonin receptor 2C), HTR6 (serotonin receptor 6), DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), DRD3 (dopamine receptor D3), DRD4 (dopamine receptor D4), CHRM1 (cholinergic receptor M1), CHRM3 (cholinergic receptor M3), and CHRM4 (cholinergic receptor M4) are all involved in the regulation of neurotransmission and could be potential targets for the molecule due to its ability to form electrostatic interactions with positively charged residues.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's long alkyl chain and carboxylic acid group suggest that it could interact with ion channels such as KCNH2 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2) and LCK (Lck tyrosine kinase), which may also be influenced by the presence of charged or hydrophobic regions.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and the potential interactions described, the related genes include: HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, KCNH2, and LCK. These genes are primarily associated with neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels, making them the most likely candidates for interaction with the described molecule.
