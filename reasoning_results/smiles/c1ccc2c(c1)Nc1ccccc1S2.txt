Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: c1ccc2c(c1)Nc1ccccc1S2, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a molecule that includes a benzene ring, a nitrogen atom, and a sulfur atom. These functional groups suggest the molecule may have interactions with proteins involved in neurotransmission and signaling pathways.
Step 2: The presence of a nitrogen atom and sulfur atom suggests the molecule could be an amine or thioether compound, which are common in ligands for receptors such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This indicates potential interaction with genes encoding for GPCRs.
Step 3: Among the provided genes, several are known to encode GPCRs, including ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, and HTR6. These genes code for adrenergic and cholinergic receptors, as well as serotonin receptors, which are activated by various ligands, including small molecules.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule's structure might also interact with other genes involved in signal transduction pathways, such as PTGS1 (which codes for cyclooxygenase-1, an enzyme involved in prostaglandin synthesis), and CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 (cytochrome P450 enzymes that metabolize many drugs).
Step 5: Based on the structural analysis, the molecule is likely to be related to several genes, particularly those encoding GPCRs (ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6) and enzymes involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, PTGS1).
