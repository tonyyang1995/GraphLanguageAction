Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: Cc1cc(C(=O)OCC(=O)Nc2sc3c(c2C#N)CCC(C)C3)c2ccccc2n1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule likely containing multiple functional groups such as an amide, carboxylic acid, and aromatic rings. This suggests the molecule could be a drug-like compound with potential interactions with proteins involved in cellular signaling and metabolism.
Step 2: Analyzing the molecule's structure, it contains a benzene ring system (indicated by the 'c' and 'c' characters), which is common in many drug molecules due to its stability and ability to form hydrogen bonds. This structural feature might interact with proteins that have similar aromatic residues, such as receptors or enzymes.
Step 3: The presence of an amide group (-CONH-) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) indicates potential for binding to proteins through hydrogen bonding and other non-covalent interactions. These functional groups are often found in ligands that interact with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other receptors that mediate cellular responses to various stimuli.
Step 4: Considering the possible interactions based on the molecule's structure, it could potentially bind to and modulate the activity of several GPCRs listed among the provided genes. GPCRs are known to interact with small molecules that mimic their natural ligands, thereby altering cellular signaling pathways.
Step 5: Based on the molecule's structure and the potential interactions with GPCRs, the related genes include: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6.
Summary of related genes: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6. These genes encode for GPCRs that may be targeted by the described molecule.
