Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: COc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)Nc2cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c2OC)cc1N1CC[NH2+]CC1, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule contains a complex structure with multiple functional groups including an amide, a sulfoxide, a phenolic hydroxyl group, and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle. This diverse structure suggests potential interactions with various biological targets.
Step 2: The presence of a sulfonyl group (-SO2-) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) in the molecule indicates it could be a potent inhibitor or modulator of enzymes involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP (cytochrome P450) enzymes. CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 are known to be involved in the metabolism of many drugs and have sulfoxides or other similar functional groups that can interact with substrates.
Step 3: The molecule also has a quinoline-like ring system, which is characteristic of many ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are often involved in signaling pathways and are associated with various neurotransmitters. Therefore, this structure might interact with GPCRs such as HTR2A (serotonin receptor), HTR2B, and HTR2C (serotonin receptors).
Step 4: Given the presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group and the overall structure, the molecule could potentially interact with ion channels or transporters. For example, SLC6A4 (norepinephrine transporter) and SLC6A2 (serotonin transporter) have similar functional groups that can interact with ligands.
Step 5: Based on the identified structural features and their potential interactions, the related genes include: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, SLC6A4, and SLC6A2.
Summary of related gene names:
- CYP2C9
- CYP2C19
- CYP2D6
- HTR2A
- HTR2B
- HTR2C
- SLC6A4
- SLC6A2 Step 1: The given molecule contains a complex structure with multiple functional groups including an amide, a sulfoxide, a phenolic hydroxyl group, and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle. This diverse structure suggests potential interactions with various biological targets.
