Given the following molecule represented by the SMILES string: O=[N+]([O-])c1cccc2c[n-]nc12, and the following genes: ABCB1,ABL1,ADRA1D,ADRA2B,ADRB2,CA12,CA2,CA9,CACNA1H,CDK2,CHRM1,CHRM3,CHRM4,CNR1,CYP1A2,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,DRD2,DRD3,DRD4,EGFR,ESR1,FLT1,HRH1,HTR1A,HTR2A,HTR2B,HTR2C,HTR6,KCNH2,KDR,LCK,MCL1,OPRK1,PPARG,PTGS1,SIGMAR1,SLC6A2,SLC6A4, describe whether the molecule is related to one or a few of these genes in clear, simple and accurate English. Explain the relationship between the molecule and the related genes in detail. You can break down by explain the patterns of the molecule, followed by the gene features. Format the output as 'Step 1:', 'Step 2:', etc., with each step focusing on a specific aspect of the molecule's structure or properties. Finally, summarize the related gene names in a list. Limit the reasoning to at most 5 steps. You can stop after summarizing the related gene names. Step 1: The given molecule has a structure that includes a nitrogen atom with a positive charge and an oxygen atom with a negative charge, which forms a polar functional group known as a nitroso group. This functional group is often involved in interactions with proteins that have specific binding sites for such groups, particularly those associated with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Step 2: The molecule also contains a benzene ring, which is a common feature in many drugs and small molecules that interact with various enzymes and receptors. Benzene rings are often recognized by enzymes like CYPs (Cytochrome P450s) due to their aromatic nature.
Step 3: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the molecule suggests it could be an amine or a similar functional group, which is recognized by certain receptors and transporters. For example, adrenergic receptors (like ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2) and opioid receptors (like OPRK1) have specific binding sites for amines.
Step 4: Additionally, the molecule’s overall structure might suggest potential interactions with receptors or enzymes involved in neurotransmission or signal transduction pathways, which are regulated by genes such as DRD2, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, and LCK.
Step 5: Based on the molecular structure and the types of functional groups present, the molecule could potentially interact with several genes, including but not limited to: ADRA1D, ADRA2B, ADRB2, CNR1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR6, KCNH2, LCK, OPRK1, and PPARG. These genes are involved in various physiological processes such as neurotransmission, drug metabolism, and signal transduction.
